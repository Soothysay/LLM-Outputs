   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo male with history of recent pacemaker placement on [**2194-3-20**] for
   complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome,
   and hypertension was admitted with fever and hypotension concerning for
   severe sepsis.
   PLAN:
   1. Sepsis
   Patient with evidence of severe sepsis given bandemia, hypotension, and
   acute on chronic renal failure. Sources of infection include cellulitis
   and urinary tract infection given innumerable bacteria on initial UA.
   Pulmonary source appears unlikely in the setting of adequate O2 sat
   with minimal O2 supplementation. Pacer pocket without signs of
   inflammation.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures at both [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] and [**Hospital1 19**]
   - start vancomycin and ceftriaxone for broad spectrum coverage of
   hospital-acquired pneumonia and concern for MRSA
   - maintain MAP > 65 with goal CVP of [**11-2**]
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - follow-up final read of CXR
   - monitor pacer pocket and access lines closely for signs of infection
   2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency
   Patient with creatinine elevated from baseline, appears most likely
   secondary to pre-renal in the setting of hypotension and creatinine has
   already begun to improve with hydration and pressor support.
   - send urine lytes and renal US
   - consider renal consult if creatinine does not improve with improved
   BP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   3. Cellulitis
   Left lower extremity with increased erythema, edema, tenderness to
   palpation; although patient has intact neurologic exam and no evidence
   of clear effusion of left ankle.  Appearance on exam is most consistent
   with cellulitis. Given prolonged course and appearance, would certainly
   be atypical for necrotizing fasciitis. LE US was negative for DVT.  Per
   patient report, has not taken any further antibiotics for this and was
   only taking increased lasix dosing.
   - start vancomycin for concern for MRSA given recent hospitalization
   and recent pacemaker placement
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - check CK
   4. Coagulopathy
   Patient with elevated INR of unclear etiology. Differential includes
   most likely nutritional, although additional possibilities include DIC,
   or liver disease.
   - send DIC panel
 fibrinogen, FDP, LDH, haptoglobin
   - give 5 PO Vitamin K
   5. Rheumatoid Arthritis
   Stable
   - will hold etanercept (Enbrel) as it is contraindicated in sepsis
   given risks of immunosuppression
   6. Hypertension
   Patient with a history of hypertension but now clearly with hypotension
   likely in the setting of infection.
   - holding ant-HTN in the setting of severe sepsis
   - hold lasix
   7. Glaucoma
   Stable
   - continue eye drops
   8. BPH
   History of BPH in the past and on terazosin as an outpatient.
   - hold terazosin in the setting of hypotension
   9. Myelodysplastic Syndrome
   Patient with a history of pancytopenia and possibly with a diagnosis of
   myelodysplastic syndrome. All counts appear within range of recent
   hospitalization.
   - obtain further information from PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue B12
   10. Osteoporosis
   Stable
   - continue fosamax  and Vitamin D
   - hold calcium in the setting of acute renal failure
   11. Tremor
   Stable
   - continue Primidone per outpatient regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of recent pacemaker placement, complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hypertension. He was admitted with fever and hypotension, concerning for severe sepsis. The patient has evidence of severe sepsis given bandemia, hypotension, and acute on chronic renal failure. Sources of infection include cellulitis and urinary tract infection.

Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of severe sepsis with fever, hypotension, and bandemia. There are multiple potential sources of infection, including cellulitis and urinary tract infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia and concern for MRSA.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine is elevated from baseline, suggesting acute renal failure. This is likely pre-renal in nature due to hypotension and has already begun to improve with hydration and pressor support. Further evaluation with urine electrolytes, renal US, and consideration of a renal consult if creatinine does not improve is warranted.

3. Cellulitis: The patient has left lower extremity erythema, edema, and tenderness, consistent with cellulitis. Vancomycin has been started for concern for MRSA. Blood cultures have been ordered, and follow-up will be done.

4. Coagulopathy:"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo male with history of recent pacemaker placement on [**2194-3-20**] for
   complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome,
   and hypertension was admitted with fever and hypotension with urosepsis
   sepsis.
   1. Sepsis: Patient
s blood and urine from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 250**] came back today
   for gram negative cocci. Bandemia, hypotension, positive cultures. Also
   with cellulitis on Left lower extremity and small ? infiltrate RLL.  On
   low dose of phenylephrine
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures at both [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] and [**Hospital1 19**]
   - Continue levaquin and cefepime for double coverage for gram negatives
   (day 1: [**4-13**])
   - continue vancomycin for cellulitis (day 1: [**4-13**])
   - Off pressors, maintain UO >.5cc/kg/hr, and CVP >12
   - continue to follow lactate, increasing since admission
   - wean off phenylephrine today
   - monitor pacer pocket and access lines closely for signs of infection
   2. Tachycardia/SVT: Patient tachycardic to 180
s yesterday. s/p
   metoprolol push, adenosine, finally back down to HR
s in 80s with
   amiodarone drip
   - call EP consult to interrogate pacer
   - continue amiodarone, discontinue IV drip. Will start PO 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] and
   taper over weeks
   3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Patient with creatinine
   elevated from baseline, appears most likely secondary to pre-renal in
   the setting of hypotension and creatinine improving with hydration.
   FeNa: <1%
   - f/u renal US
   - consider renal consult if creatinine does not improve with improved
   BP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   4. Cellulitis: Left lower extremity with increased erythema, edema,
   tenderness to palpation; although patient has intact neurologic exam
   and no evidence of clear effusion of left ankle. Given prolonged course
   and appearance, would certainly be atypical for necrotizing fasciitis.
   LE US negative for DVT.  Per patient report, has not taken any

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   Overnight, Mr. [**Known lastname 344**] had tachycardias up to ~200.  These were
   unresponsive to adenosine, vagal maneuvers, and cardioversion.  An
   amiodarone load was begun.  He has had decrease in heart rate now to
   60s, and review of HR trends show a very rapid change, suggesting
   conversion of another rhythm (?MAT) to his present slow AFib.
   Remains on some neosynephrine for his shock.  Outside blood cultures
   show GNR, not yet speciated.
   On exam, his leg remains edematous and red, with some underlying venous
   stasis changes.  It is *not* tender, and there is no crepitus.  The
   joint
s motion is intact.  Has not extended c/w prior reports.
   Septic Shock
 given GNR bacteremia, most likely source is UTI.  Need
   to keep in mind prostatitis as an etiology as well, since this would
   change duration of therapy.  Finally, his leg does appear infected
   (without signs concerning for fasciitis as this point) and we should
   cover for that, as well.  We will therefore continue current broad
   antimicrobial coverage, as well as goal-directed therapy for
   hemodynamic management.
   AFib/SVT
 now in rate-controlled AF on amio.  Consult cards.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of recent pacemaker placement, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hypertension. He was admitted with fever and hypotension due to urosepsis. The patient has several medical complications, including sepsis, tachycardia/supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), acute on chronic renal insufficiency, cellulitis, coagulopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, glaucoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), myelodysplastic syndrome, osteoporosis, and tremor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis with gram-negative cocci in his blood and urine cultures. This is a serious infection that can lead to organ failure and death if not promptly treated.
2. Tachycardia/SVT: The patient's heart rate is significantly elevated and he is experiencing SVT. This can be life-threatening if not controlled and may require cardioversion or medication.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due to sepsis. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, which can further complicate his condition.
4. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis in his left lower extremity. If left untreated, this can progress to necrot"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo male with history of recent pacemaker placement on [**2194-3-20**] for
   complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome,
   and hypertension was admitted with fever and hypotension concerning for
   severe sepsis.
   PLAN:
   1. Sepsis
   Patient with evidence of severe sepsis given bandemia, hypotension, and
   acute on chronic renal failure. Sources of infection include cellulitis
   and urinary tract infection given innumerable bacteria on initial UA.
   Pulmonary source appears unlikely in the setting of adequate O2 sat
   with minimal O2 supplementation. Pacer pocket without signs of
   inflammation.
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures at both [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] and [**Hospital1 19**]
   - start vancomycin and ceftriaxone for broad spectrum coverage of
   hospital-acquired pneumonia and concern for MRSA
   - maintain MAP > 65 with goal CVP of [**11-2**]
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - follow-up final read of CXR
   - monitor pacer pocket and access lines closely for signs of infection
   2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency
   Patient with creatinine elevated from baseline, appears most likely
   secondary to pre-renal in the setting of hypotension and creatinine has
   already begun to improve with hydration and pressor support.
   - send urine lytes and renal US
   - consider renal consult if creatinine does not improve with improved
   BP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   3. Cellulitis
   Left lower extremity with increased erythema, edema, tenderness to
   palpation; although patient has intact neurologic exam and no evidence
   of clear effusion of left ankle.  Appearance on exam is most consistent
   with cellulitis. Given prolonged course and appearance, would certainly
   be atypical for necrotizing fasciitis. LE US was negative for DVT.  Per
   patient report, has not taken any further antibiotics for this and was
   only taking increased lasix dosing.
   - start vancomycin for concern for MRSA given recent hospitalization
   and recent pacemaker placement
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - check CK
   4. Coagulopathy
   Patient with elevated INR of unclear etiology. Differential includes
   most likely nutritional, although additional possibilities include DIC,
   or liver disease.
   - send DIC panel
 fibrinogen, FDP, LDH, haptoglobin
   - give 5 PO Vitamin K
   5. Rheumatoid Arthritis
   Stable
   - will hold etanercept (Enbrel) as it is contraindicated in sepsis
   given risks of immunosuppression
   6. Hypertension
   Patient with a history of hypertension but now clearly with hypotension
   likely in the setting of infection.
   - holding ant-HTN in the setting of severe sepsis
   - hold lasix
   7. Glaucoma
   Stable
   - continue eye drops
   8. BPH
   History of BPH in the past and on terazosin as an outpatient.
   - hold terazosin in the setting of hypotension
   9. Myelodysplastic Syndrome
   Patient with a history of pancytopenia and possibly with a diagnosis of
   myelodysplastic syndrome. All counts appear within range of recent
   hospitalization.
   - obtain further information from PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue B12
   10. Osteoporosis
   Stable
   - continue fosamax  and Vitamin D
   - hold calcium in the setting of acute renal failure
   11. Tremor
   Stable
   - continue Primidone per outpatient regimen

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from the information in the note:

1. Sepsis: The patient has evidence of severe sepsis given bandemia (low white blood cell count), hypotension, and acute on chronic renal failure. Sources of infection include cellulitis and urinary tract infection.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine is elevated from baseline, indicating impaired kidney function. This is likely secondary to pre-renal causes due to hypotension.

3. Cellulitis: The patient has left lower extremity with increased erythema, edema, tenderness to palpation, suggesting cellulitis. There is concern for MRSA given recent hospitalization and pacemaker placement.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of unclear etiology. Nutritional deficiency is the most likely cause, but additional possibilities include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo male with history of recent pacemaker placement on [**2194-3-20**] for
   complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome,
   and hypertension was admitted with fever and hypotension with urosepsis
   sepsis.
   1. Sepsis: Patient
s blood and urine from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 250**] came back today
   for gram negative cocci. Bandemia, hypotension, positive cultures. Also
   with cellulitis on Left lower extremity and small ? infiltrate RLL.  On
   low dose of phenylephrine
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures at both [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] and [**Hospital1 19**]
   - Continue levaquin and cefepime for double coverage for gram negatives
   (day 1: [**4-13**])
   - continue vancomycin for cellulitis (day 1: [**4-13**])
   - Off pressors, maintain UO >.5cc/kg/hr, and CVP >12
   - continue to follow lactate, increasing since admission
   - wean off phenylephrine today
   - monitor pacer pocket and access lines closely for signs of infection
   2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Patient with creatinine
   elevated from baseline, appears most likely secondary to pre-renal in
   the setting of hypotension and creatinine improving with hydration.
   FeNa: <1%
   - f/u renal US
   - consider renal consult if creatinine does not improve with improved
   BP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   3. Cellulitis: Left lower extremity with increased erythema, edema,
   tenderness to palpation; although patient has intact neurologic exam
   and no evidence of clear effusion of left ankle.  Appearance on exam is
   most consistent with cellulitis. Given prolonged course and appearance,
   would certainly be atypical for necrotizing fasciitis. LE US was
   negative for DVT.  Per patient report, has not taken any further
   antibiotics for this and was only taking increased lasix dosing.
   - start vancomycin for concern for MRSA given recent hospitalization
   and recent pacemaker placement
   - follow-up blood cultures
   - check CK
   4. Coagulopathy
   Patient with elevated INR of unclear etiology. Differential includes
   most likely nutritional, although additional possibilities include DIC,
   or liver disease.
   - send DIC panel
 fibrinogen, FDP, LDH, haptoglobin
   - give 5 PO Vitamin K
   5. Rheumatoid Arthritis
   Stable
   - will hold etanercept (Enbrel) as it is contraindicated in sepsis
   given risks of immunosuppression
   6. Hypertension
   Patient with a history of hypertension but now clearly with hypotension
   likely in the setting of infection.
   - holding ant-HTN in the setting of severe sepsis
   - hold lasix
   7. Glaucoma
   Stable
   - continue eye drops
   8. BPH
   History of BPH in the past and on terazosin as an outpatient.
   - hold terazosin in the setting of hypotension
   9. Myelodysplastic Syndrome
   Patient with a history of pancytopenia and possibly with a diagnosis of
   myelodysplastic syndrome. All counts appear within range of recent
   hospitalization.
   - obtain further information from PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue B12
   10. Osteoporosis
   Stable
   - continue fosamax  and Vitamin D
   - hold calcium in the setting of acute renal failure
   11. Tremor
   Stable
   - continue Primidone per outpatient regimen

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of recent pacemaker placement, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hypertension. He was admitted with fever and hypotension, diagnosed with urosepsis and sepsis. The patient has several medical complications including sepsis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, cellulitis, coagulopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, glaucoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), myelodysplastic syndrome, osteoporosis, and tremor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's blood and urine cultures showed gram-negative cocci, indicating a bacterial infection. He is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (levaquin and cefepime) for gram-negative coverage, as well as vancomycin for cellulitis. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and lactate levels is important to assess the response to treatment.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting impaired kidney function. This could be due to pre-renal causes in the setting of hypotension. It is important to monitor urine output and central venous pressure, and consider a renal consult if creatinine does not improve with improved blood pressure.
3. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis on the left lower extremity. Treatment with vancomycin is"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's blood and urine cultures are positive for gram-negative cocci, indicating an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued antibiotic therapy is essential.
2. Tachycardia/SVT: The patient experienced a rapid heart rate of 180 beats per minute and required multiple interventions, including metoprolol, adenosine, and amiodarone. Further evaluation by an electrophysiology (EP) consult is recommended.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, likely due to pre-renal causes related to hypotension. Hydration and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications are necessary. Renal ultrasound and consultation may be required if there is no improvement in renal function"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo male with history of recent pacemaker placement on [**2194-3-20**] for
   complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome,
   and hypertension was admitted with fever and hypotension with urosepsis
   sepsis.
   1. Sepsis: Patient
s blood and urine from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 250**] came back today
   for gram negative cocci. Bandemia, hypotension, positive cultures. Also
   with cellulitis on Left lower extremity and small ? infiltrate RLL.  On
   low dose of phenylephrine
   - follow-up blood and urine cultures at both [**Hospital1 7**] [**Location (un) 250**] and [**Hospital1 19**]
   - Continue levaquin and cefepime for double coverage for gram negatives
   (day 1: [**4-13**]) until sensitivities come back. day 3
   - continue vancomycin for cellulitis (day 1: [**4-13**]). Day 3
   - maintain UO >.5cc/kg/hr, and CVP >12
   - continue to follow lactate, increasing since admission
   - wean off phenylephrine today
   - monitor pacer pocket and access lines closely for signs of infection
   2. Tachycardia/SVT: Patient tachycardic to 180
s yesterday. s/p
   metoprolol push, adenosine, finally back down to HR
s in 80s with
   amiodarone drip
   - call EP consult to interrogate pacer
   - continue amiodarone, discontinue IV drip. Will start PO 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] and
   taper over weeks
   3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Patient with creatinine
   elevated from baseline, appears most likely secondary to pre-renal in
   the setting of hypotension and creatinine improving with hydration.
   FeNa: <1%
   - f/u renal US
   - consider renal consult if creatinine does not improve with improved
   BP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   4. Cellulitis: Left lower extremity with increased erythema, edema,
   tenderness to palpation; although patient has intact neurologic exam
   and no evidence of clear effusion of left ankle. Given prolonged course
   and appearance, would certainly be atypical for necrotizing fasciitis.
   LE US negative for DVT.  Per patient report, has not taken any
   antibiotics for this and was only taking increased lasix dosing.
   - continue vancomycin for concern for MRSA given recent hospitalization
   and recent pacemaker placement (day 1: [**4-13**])
   - follow-up culture sensitivities from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 250**]
   - f/u CK
   - Consider leg Xray for osteomyelitis
   5. Coagulopathy: Patient with elevated INR of unclear etiology.
   Differential includes DIC or liver disease.  Nutritional  unlikely
   given not improving with vitamin K
   - follow DIC panel (fibrinogen, FDP, LDH, haptoglobin) q8h
   6. Rheumatoid Arthritis: Stable
   - hold etanercept (Enbrel) as it is contraindicated in sepsis given
   risks of immunosuppression
   7. Hypertension: Patient with a history of hypertension but now
   hypotension on pressors in the setting of infection.
   - holding anti-HTN in the setting of severe sepsis
   - hold lasix
   8. Glaucoma: Stable
   - continue eye drops
   9. BPH: History of BPH and elevated PSA in the past and on terazosin as
   an outpatient.
   - hold terazosin in the setting of hypotension
   10. Myelodysplastic Syndrome: Patient with a history of pancytopenia
   and possibly with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome. All counts
   appear within range of recent hospitalization.
   - obtain further information from PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] continue B12
   12. Osteoporosis: Stable
   - continue fosamax  and Vitamin D
   - hold calcium in the setting of acute renal failure
   13. Tremor: Stable
   - continue Primidone per outpatient regimen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of recent pacemaker placement, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hypertension. The patient was admitted with fever and hypotension due to urosepsis sepsis. The medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient has positive blood and urine cultures for gram-negative cocci, bandemia, hypotension, and cellulitis on the left lower extremity. This indicates an ongoing infection, which if not properly managed, can lead to further complications such as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) or septic shock.

2. Tachycardia/SVT: The patient experienced a rapid heart rate of 180 beats per minute, which was controlled with medication and an EP consult to interrogate the pacemaker. This suggests an arrhythmia, which if not managed appropriately, can lead to cardiac complications like atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated from baseline, suggesting renal impairment. This condition can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not managed properly, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

4. Cellulitis: The patient has left lower extremity cellulitis with increased erythema, edema, and tenderness"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of recent pacemaker placement, complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hypertension. The patient was admitted with fever and hypotension, which was later diagnosed as urosepsis sepsis. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, as indicated by blood and urine cultures growing gram-negative cocci, bandemia, hypotension, and positive cultures. The patient is currently being treated with levaquin and cefepime for double coverage of gram negatives, as well as vancomycin for cellulitis.
2. Tachycardia/SVT: The patient experienced tachycardia with a heart rate of 180 beats per minute, which was successfully managed with medication and an amiodarone drip. The underlying cause of the tachycardia is believed to be an atrial tachycardia secondary to infection.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal insufficiency. This could be due to pre-renal causes in the setting of hypotension. Renal function is improving with hydration, but there may be some degree of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further evaluation is needed, and a renal consult may be"

 is pan sensitive.
   - Continue levaquin and cefepime for double coverage for gram negatives
   (day 1: [**4-13**]) until final sensitivities come back. day 3
   - continue vancomycin for cellulitis (day 1: [**4-13**]). Day 3 Dose by level
   - maintain UO >.5cc/kg/hr, and CVP >12
   - lactate trending down, no need to follow
   - wean off phenylephrine today
   - monitor pacer pocket and access lines closely for signs of infection
   - Also consider prostatitis for for positive UA and bacteremia.
   2. Tachycardia/SVT: Patient tachycardic to 180
s yesterday. s/p
   metoprolol push, adenosine, finally back down to HR
s in 80s with
   amiodarone drip
   - EP agrees that tachyarrhythmia was atrial tachycardia secondary to
   infection, agree with amiodarone
   - continue amiodarone PO 400mg [**Hospital1 7**] and taper over weeks
   3. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Patient with creatinine
   elevated from baseline, appears most likely secondary to pre-renal in
   the setting of hypotension and creatinine improving with hydration.
   FeNa: <1% on admission. Not improving since initial, patient may have
   some degree of ATN
   - f/u renal US: medical renal disease
   - consider renal consult if creatinine does not improve with improved
   BP
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose meds
   - recheck urine lytes. Check urine sediment for casts.
   4. Cellulitis: Left lower extremity with increased erythema, edema,
   tenderness to palpation; although patient has intact neurologic exam
   and no evidence of clear effusion of left ankle. Given prolonged course
   and appearance, would be atypical for necrotizing fasciitis. LE US
   negative for DVT.  Per patient report, has not taken any antibiotics
   for this and was only taking increased lasix dosing.
   - continue vancomycin (day 1: [**4-13**]), dose by level
   - follow-up culture sensitivities from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 250**]
   - Consider leg Xray for osteomyelitis if dose not improve

   since improving with vitamin K.  DIC panel stable [**2111-4-14**]
   - follow DIC panel (fibrinogen, FDP, LDH, haptoglobin) daily
    Stable issues:
   7. Rheumatoid Arthritis: Stable
   - hold etanercept (Enbrel) as it is contraindicated in sepsis given
   risks of immunosuppression
   8. Hypertension: Patient with a history of hypertension but now
   hypotension on pressors in the setting of infection.
   - holding anti-HTN in the setting of severe sepsis
   - hold lasix
   9. Glaucoma: Stable
   - continue eye drops
   10. BPH: History of BPH and elevated PSA in the past and on terazosin
   as an outpatient.
   - hold terazosin in the setting of hypotension
   11. Myelodysplastic Syndrome: Patient with a history of pancytopenia
   and possibly with a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome. All counts
   appear within range of recent hospitalization.
   - obtain further information from PCP

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Sepsis: The patient has already been diagnosed with urosepsis and sepsis, indicating a systemic infection. This condition can lead to organ failure and death if not promptly treated.

2. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis on the left lower extremity. If left untreated, it can spread and potentially lead to necrotizing fasciitis, which is a severe and life-threatening infection of the skin and underlying tissues.

3. Renal Insufficiency: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal insufficiency. This can be further complicated by acute tubular necrosis (ATN), especially if the patient continues to experience hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion.

4. Tachycardia/SVT: The patient experienced a rapid heart rate of 180 beats per minute due to atrial tachycardia, likely secondary to infection. If not properly managed, this condition can lead to arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and potential cardiac arrest.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating a potential bleeding risk. This could be due to various factors such as liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or nutritional deficiencies. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

6. Diarrhea/C. diff: The patient has experienced episodes"

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of recent pacemaker placement for complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hypertension. He was admitted with fever and hypotension due to urosepsis. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including sepsis, tachycardia/atrial tachycardia, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, cellulitis, diarrhea, coagulopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, glaucoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), myelodysplastic syndrome, osteoporosis, and tremor.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely caused by gram-negative bacteria, and is being treated with antibiotics.
- The patient's tachycardia was successfully managed with medication and an amiodarone drip.
- The patient's renal function is compromised, with elevated creatinine levels. This may be due to pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis.
- Cellulitis on the left lower extremity has been identified, and vancomycin is being administered for treatment.
- The patient has experienced episodes of diarrhea, which could be related to antibiotic use or Clostridium difficile infection.
- The patient has a coagulopathy, possibly due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver disease. Vitamin K"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of recent pacemaker placement, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hypertension. He was admitted with fever and hypotension due to urosepsis and sepsis. The patient's blood and urine cultures grew gram-negative cocci. He also has cellulitis on his left lower extremity and a small infiltrate in the right lower lobe of his lung. 

The patient has been on low-dose phenylephrine, and his lactate levels are trending down. He was tachycardic but responded well to metoprolol, adenosine, and amiodarone. The patient has acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency, which is likely secondary to pre-renal causes and improving with hydration. He also has cellulitis on his left lower extremity, and his urine output needs to be maintained at more than 0.5 cc/kg/hr, and his central venous pressure (CVP) should be greater than 12. 

The patient has a history of prostate radiation for cancer and prostatitis is unlikely. He is also being treated for atrial tachycardia, which was secondary to infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's blood and urine cultures grew gram-negative cocci, indicating a bacterial infection. This could lead to further complications if not treated appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of recent pacemaker placement, complete heart block, atrial fibrillation, myelodysplastic syndrome, and hypertension. He was admitted with fever and hypotension due to Klebsiella urosepsis sepsis. The patient has since recovered from hypotension but still has an active infection with positive blood and urine cultures for pan-sensitive Klebsiella. He also has cellulitis on his left lower extremity and a small infiltrate in the right lower lobe. The patient's current medications include ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and phenylephrine. He is being monitored closely for any signs of recurrent fever, bandemia, bacteremia, especially given his new pacemaker implantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's recent infection with Klebsiella urosepsis sepsis could potentially lead to recurrent or worsening sepsis if the current infection is not effectively treated.
2. Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis on the left lower extremity may progress or become more severe if not properly managed.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and presence of granular casts in the urine suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury (ATN). If not managed appropriately, this condition could worsen.
4. Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of atrial"
