   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  83M AF on Coumadin, CMP EF 20% s/p recent ERCP
   with sphincterotomy now admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] s/p PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA Arrest likely [**3-10**] to hypovolemia from sphincterotomy bleed:
   Occured in setting of known GIB. Differential includes hypovolemic,
   cardiac thrombosis, PE, sepsis, hypoglycemia. Hct fell to 25 from 38
   two days ago requiring massive resuscitation and triple pressers. Pt
   now currently off pressers with ongoing melanotic stools.
   - Maintain 2 large bore IVs
   - HCT looks stable today at 38, would space out phlebotomy to q6h
   - Maintain Hct>30 given cardiac history, however transfuse for any
   signs of ongoing bleeding or hypotension.
   - Maintain MAPs>65
   - Sv02 of 97 speaks against cardiogenic shock
   - lactate peaked at 8.3 at 6:00PM yesterday, currently 1.6
   - f/u ERCP and Sugery Recs, consider IR if pt continue to bleed
   - Considered IV PPI, currently holding off
   - Holding coumadin, lasix, carvedilol and spironolactone in setting of
   PEA arrest
   .
   # Acute Metabolic Acidosis: Gap metabolic acidosis in setting of
   elevated lactate with respiratory compenstation. Now improving with
   resuscitation, mechanical ventilation and 1 amp of bicarb.
   - Gap peaked at 16 along with lactate of 8.3 now greatly improved at 9
   and 1.6 respectively.
   - trend lytes
   - Maintain MAPs >65
   # Acute Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated prior to procedure.
   Given history of EF of 20%, patient has potential for pulmonary edema.
   Currently oxygenating well on AC Tv 500 x 20. Tachypnea likely
   compensation for Acute Metabolic Acidosis (Lactic)
   - Maintain pt on AC overnight
   - Reassess CXR in AM following colloid resuscitation
   # ECG Changes: Pt with wide complex ventricular rhythm during arrest.
   Cards consulted and felt ""Evidence of wide complex rhythm consistent
   with idioventricular ventricular rhythm likely secondary to metabolic
   disarray and reperfusion following resuscitation. The primary treatment
   for his rhythm is correction of his metabolic acidosis.""
   - Repeat ECG when acidosis corrected
   - TTE in AM
   - f/u Cards recs in AM
   - cardiac enzymes
 troponins appear to have peaked, difficult to
   interpret given renal faillure, Ck
s look skeletal muscle in origin,
   likely [**3-10**] CPR
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely secondary to hypotension following hypotensive event, pt
   still producing 15cc/hr.
   - Avoid Nephrotoxins
   - Maintain MAPs>65
   -
   # AF- Currently rate controlled despite being off B-Blocker. Also not
   on anticoagulation in setting of GIB.
   - holding carvedilol, coumadin, spironolactone
   - continue amio and dig, check dig level given ARF
   - ECG
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   .
   ACCESS: PIVs x 2, Right Femoral CVL, Left Femoral A-Line, Left Femoral
   Triple Lumen A-Line (placed mistakenly, should be d/c in AM)
   .
   CODE STATUS: Currently intubated, patients family does not wish the
   patient to receive further chest compressions or external
   defibrillations. Pt will be made DNR/DNI if extubated.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation who presented with acute respiratory failure and was intubated prior to an ERCP procedure. During the procedure, the patient experienced a PEA arrest and required resuscitation with CPR, epinephrine, and multiple pressors. The patient is now off pressors with stable blood pressure but remains intubated. The patient has ongoing melena and is producing 15cc/hr of bloody stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's current assessment includes hypovolemia from sphincterotomy bleed, acute metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate levels, acute respiratory failure, ECG changes consistent with an idioventricular ventricular rhythm secondary to metabolic disarray, renal failure, and atrial fibrillation that is currently rate-controlled. The patient is not on anticoagulation due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The plan includes maintaining two large bore IVs, spacing out phlebotomy to q6h, transfusing for any signs of ongoing bleeding or hypotension, maintaining MAPs >65, SvO2 of 97, lactate levels, trend electrolytes, reassess CXR in AM, maintain pt on AC overnight, repeat ECG when acidosis corrected, TTE in AM, follow-up cardiology recommendations, avoid nephrotoxins, and continue amiodarone and digoxin while checking dig level given ARF.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest after undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient was successfully resuscitated with CPR, epinephrine, and three pressors. The patient is now intubated and has stable blood pressure without the need for pressors.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/98 mmHg to 106/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is ventricular-paced.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 9,706 mL and output of 1,762 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 7,944 mL. The patient's urine output is 262 mL, and stool output is 1,500 mL.

The patient has undergone several lab tests, which reveal the following abnormalities: elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 11.7 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 13.2 g/dL, high potassium (K+) level at 5.7 mg/dL, elevated lactate level at 1.6 mmol/L, and decreased platelet count (Plt) at 154 K/uL.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom A-Fib (coumadin), now with GI bleed attributed to recent
   ampullary sphincterotomy --> repeat ERCP demonstrated ampulla site
   bleeding --> cauterized, complicated by PEA arrest.
   PEA CARDIA ARREST -- Most likely attributed to significant GI bleed
   (hypovolemia).  Resolved, resussitated.  No further evidence for
   hemodynamic instability.
   GI BLEED -- attributed to recent ampulla sphincterotomy (aggravated by
   coumadin use). Now  s/p repeat ERCP with cauterization.  No further
   clinical evidence for bleed.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia.  Doubt sepsis.
   FEMORAL A-LINE -- need to remove, and possible surgical repair.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, admitted for an ampullary sphincterotomy. The patient experienced a gastrointestinal bleed, which was initially attributed to the sphincterotomy but was later complicated by Coumadin use. The bleed was cauterized during a repeat ERCP procedure. The patient also experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, likely due to significant GI bleed and subsequent hypovolemia. The PEA arrest was resolved and the patient was resuscitated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed, which required intervention through a repeat ERCP procedure with cauterization. Although the bleed appears to have stopped, there is a risk of rebleeding or ongoing slow bleeding that may lead to anemia or further complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension attributed to hypovolemia from the GI bleed. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Femoral A-Line Complication: The patient had a femoral a-line, which needs to be removed and possibly surgically repaired. There is a risk of vascular injury or infection at the site of the line.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory distress syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom A-Fib (coumadin), now with GI bleed attributed to recent
   ampullary sphincterotomy --> repeat ERCP demonstrated ampulla site
   bleeding --> cauterized, complicated by PEA arrest.
   PEA CARDIA ARREST -- Most likely attributed to significant GI bleed
   (hypovolemia).  Resolved, resussitated.  No further evidence for
   hemodynamic instability.
   GI BLEED -- attributed to recent ampulla sphincterotomy (aggravated by
   coumadin use). Now  s/p repeat ERCP with cauterization.  No further
   clinical evidence for bleed.  Monitor serial exam and serial Hct.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia.  Doubt sepsis.
   FEMORAL A-LINE -- need to remove, and possible surgical repair.
   Consult Vascular Surgery to assess.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and on Coumadin. He presented with respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient underwent an ampullary sphincterotomy, which resulted in GI bleed. The bleeding was initially controlled through cauterization during a repeat ERCP procedure.

The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, likely due to significant GI bleed leading to hypovolemia. He was successfully resuscitated and showed no further signs of hemodynamic instability. The GI bleed was attributed to the recent ampulla sphincterotomy and aggravated by Coumadin use. The patient underwent another ERCP with cauterization to control the bleeding. However, there are no current clinical indications of ongoing bleeding.

The patient also experienced hypotension, which was likely caused by hypovolemia and not due to sepsis. It is recommended to remove the femoral A-line and consider surgical repair. A consultation with Vascular Surgery should be sought to assess the situation.

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires close monitoring of vital signs, serial examinations, and serial Hct levels. The patient's nutritional needs should be addressed, and glycemic control should be maintained. The patient currently has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line and a multi-lumen line.

Prophylaxis measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 83-year-old male who underwent an ERCP procedure and subsequently experienced a PEA arrest due to hypovolemia from a sphincterotomy bleed. The patient is currently off pressors, with ongoing melena and stabilization of acidosis and lactate levels.

- The patient has a history of GIB (gastrointestinal bleeding), wide complex ventricular rhythm during arrest, and a history of ventricular tachycardia. ECG changes indicate a wide complex rhythm consistent with an idioventricular ventricular rhythm likely secondary to metabolic disarray and reperfusion following resuscitation.

- The patient's cardiac medications, including amiodarone and digoxin, have been restarted. The patient is also scheduled for a trans-thoracic echo (TTE) to further evaluate his cardiac condition.

- The patient's kidney function is currently impaired, possibly due to hypotension following the hypotensive event, leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Measures to avoid nephrotoxins and maintain adequate blood pressure are being implemented.

- The patient has atrial fibrillation that is currently rate-controlled despite being off beta-blockers. Anticoagulation therapy has been withheld in the setting of GIB.

- The patient appears mildly volume overloaded, with crackles and upper extremity edema. Diuretics have"

   cardiac thrombosis, PE, sepsis, hypoglycemia. Hct fell to 25 from 38
   two days ago requiring massive resuscitation and triple pressers. Pt
   now currently off pressers with ongoing melanotic stools.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and a low ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.

The patient's condition was complicated by hypovolemia due to a sphincterotomy bleed and known gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient required massive resuscitation with fluids and blood transfusions. Currently, the patient is off pressors, but there is ongoing melena (black, tarry stools), indicating ongoing bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure of 127/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, indicating tissue hypoperfusion and possible lactic acidosis. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, suggesting renal dysfunction.

The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function. An arterial line, central venous line, and two peripheral intravenous lines have been placed.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Maintain Hct > 30 due to cardiac history,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding. The bleeding was attributed to a recent ampullary sphincterotomy and was aggravated by Coumadin use. The patient underwent a repeat ERCP with cauterization to address the bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient had a significant gastrointestinal bleed due to the ampullary sphincterotomy, which was exacerbated by Coumadin use. Although the bleeding has been addressed, monitoring for any signs of re-bleeding is essential.

2. PEA Arrest: The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest likely related to the significant GI bleed and subsequent hypovolemia. The patient was successfully resuscitated, but this event highlights the potential risk of cardiovascular instability in the setting of significant blood loss.

3. Hypotension: The patient had episodes of hypotension, which were attributed to hypovolemia secondary to the GI bleed. This emphasizes the need for close monitoring of hemodynamic status and appropriate fluid resuscitation if necessary.

4. Nutritional Support: The patient requires nutritional support due to his critical illness and potential inability to meet nutritional requirements through oral intake. Proper nutrition is crucial for recovery and maintaining immune function.

5. Renal Failure: The patient is suspected to have acute tubular necrosis (ATN), particularly in the context"

The bleeding was successfully cauterized during a repeat ERCP procedure. The patient experienced a PEA arrest, which was most likely caused by significant blood loss leading to hypovolemia. The patient was resuscitated and no further evidence of hemodynamic instability was observed. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on Coumadin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7 C (98.9 F)
- Heart rate: 71 bpm (range 65-82)
- Blood pressure: 159/108 mmHg (range 100-119)
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (range 13-24)
- Oxygen saturation: 81%

The patient's physical examination revealed no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 13.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 149 K/uL, blood glucose level of 99 mg/dL, sodium level of 19 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.9 mEq/L, and a platelet count of 154 K/uL. Other lab values indicate possible renal failure, but this is still under investigation.

The patient's assessment and plan include monitoring for signs of GI bleed and renal failure, as well as ensuring proper glycemic control, line management, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is to be transferred to the floor."
