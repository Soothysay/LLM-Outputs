","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis secondary to a hospital-acquired pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen through an aerosol-cool device. His vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 93/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been started on diltiazem for rate control and is receiving IV antibiotics including cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. His urine output has been low, so he received a bolus. 

Potential Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's admission to the ICU is due to suspected sepsis secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or development of new infections while in the ICU.

2. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,735 mL and output of 1,705 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a deficit of 30 mL. Close monitoring of fluid status and appropriate adjustments may be necessary to prevent fluid overload or dehydration.

3. Respiratory Distress: The patient is currently"

   PORTABLE CXR
   FINDINGS: Since the previous study earlier on the same date, the NG
   tube is
   unchanged. The left pleural effusion is moderate and unchanged. No new
   consolidation or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
   unchanged.
   IMPRESSION:
   No interval change since previous study earlier the same date.
   CT ABD/PELVIS (FINAL)
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Moderately limited study due to patient motion and position. Small
   to
   moderate amount of ascites, increased in extent from prior study, with
   slight
   nodular appearance of the peritoneal fat in the left upper quadrant,
   more
   likely related to the ascites rather than representing peritoneal
   deposits.
   2. Moderate-sized left pleural effusion, with associated
   consolidation/atelectasis of the adjacent lung, similar in size to
   prior
   study.
   3. Circumferential bladder wall thickening. Recommend correlation with
   urinalysis, as findings could be due to cystitis, although bladder not
   fully
   distended.
   4. Diffusely osteopenic bones, with multilevel degenerative changes and
   multiple wedge compression deformities of the lumbar spine.
   CT HEAD ( FINAL)
   FINDINGS: The study is significantly limited by motion artifacts
   despite
   multiple repeated scans. There is unchanged hyperdensity in the globus
   pallidus, mostly on the left but also slightly on the right, which is
   most
   consistent with mineralization. There is no evidence of acute
   hemorrhage,
   edema, or mass effect. Moderate cerebral atrophy and severe cerebellar
   atrophy are again seen.
   IMPRESSION:
   Study significantly limited due to patient motion. No evidence of acute
   hemorrhage or other acute abnormalities. High density in the left
   globus
   pallidus most likely represents mineralization.
   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo m with hx of CVA, Afib, and recurrent PNAs who was admitted after
   an episode of decreased responsiveness at his NH, now with concern for
   PNA and afib with RVR.
   .
   # Tachypnea/Possible PNA: On review of CXRs appears that LLL
   effusion/infiltrate has been persistent and appears unchanged.  SOB
   episodes likely due to pt
s sensitivity to HR > 110s as he becomes
   tachypneic with increased WOB when HR > 110.
   - dilt gtt and po meds to keep HR<110s
   - continue ipratropium nebs q6 hours and xopenex q4 hours
   - continue chest PT and suctioning
   - consider repeat chest CT
   - bedside U/S to assess extent of LLL effusion
consider [**Female First Name (un) **]
   - cont vanco/cefe/cipro for HAP coverage x 8 days
   - ABGs as needed
   # Afib with RVR: Pt requires large doses of nodal agents for rate
   control. Not on coumadin due to hx of recent GI bleed.
   - dilt gtt for HR <110
   - cont lopressor 25 mg po q6 hours, uptitrate as tolerated by BP
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - hold coumadin given recent GI bleed
   - monitor on tele
   # Altered Mental Status: at baseline has AMS, but responds yes/no. On
   head CT, appears to have old CVA on left. Now with less reponsiveness.
   Possible causes include CVA (head CT without acute change), seizure
   (has sz hx), and delerium related to infection. Delerium is most likely
   at this time.
   - continue depakote and primidone
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   .
   # C. Diff infection: had a current infection at NH on flagyl, unclear
   where pt is in his tx course
   - will continue PO flagyl while on other abx
   - monitor stool output
   - c. diff percautions
   # LE edema: chronic, unclear cause
   - contiue home lasix, but will hold if becoming to negative (goal even)
   .
   # Stage III ulcer: chronic ulcer, was seen during last hospitalization
   - wound care consult
   - moitor daily
   - abx as above
   .
   # Colon cancer: had colonsocpy [**9-6**] with mass at 110cm, on bx had high
   grade dyplasia. Unclear depth, since base of growth not bx. Appeared
   malignant on colonscopy. Unclear if his HCP has decided to have staging
   of the cancer or other treatment. Hx of recent GI bleed that was
   attributed to this lesion. No hx of obstruction.
   - discuss with HCP if further staging/tx will be done
   - monitor for obstruction (non seen on CT abd in ER)
   .
   # Nerogenic Bladder: chronic foley, likely from CVA hx, urine with
   positive nitrates and few bacteria but may be colonization
   - continue foley
   - f/u urine cx
   - on abx above that will cover possible UTI
   .
   # Anemia: chronic, being tx with iron, has hx of recent lower GI bleed,
   and dx of colon cancer
   - continue iron supplements
   - monitor stools for blood
   - monitor hct

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CVA, atrial fibrillation, and recurrent pneumonia who was admitted after an episode of decreased responsiveness at his nursing home. The patient is currently in the ICU with concerns for pneumonia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea/Possible PNA: The patient's episodes of shortness of breath are likely due to his sensitivity to a heart rate above 110 beats per minute, which causes increased work of breathing. To address this, the patient will receive diltiazem via gtt to keep the heart rate below 110 beats per minute. Other interventions include ipratropium nebs every 6 hours, xopenex every 4 hours, chest PT and suctioning, repeat chest CT, and bedside ultrasound to assess the extent of left lower lobe effusion.

2. Afib with RVR: The patient requires large doses of nodal agents for rate control. Since he has a history of recent gastrointestinal bleed, he is not on coumadin. The plan is to use diltiazem gtt for heart rate control, continue lopressor 25 mg po q6 hours with titration as tolerated by blood pressure, ASA 325 mg daily, hold coumadin due to recent GI bleed, monitor on tele.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of altered mental status, but"

   consolidation or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
   unchanged.
   IMPRESSION:
   No interval change since previous study earlier the same date.

   # Tachypnea/Possible PNA: On review of CXRs appears that LLL
   effusion/infiltrate has been persistent and appears unchanged.  SOB
   episodes likely due to pt
s sensitivity to HR > 110s as he becomes
   tachypneic with increased WOB when HR > 110.
   - dilt gtt for now and metoprolol 25 Q6H, try to uptitrate PO meds with
   goal HR<100s
   - continue ipratropium nebs q6 hours and xopenex q4 hours
   - continue chest PT and suctioning PRN
   - consider repeat chest CT
   - bedside U/S to assess extent of LLL effusion, consider [**Female First Name (un) **]
   - cont vanco/cefe/cipro for HAP coverage x 8 days (day 2)
   - ABGs as needed
   # Afib with RVR: Pt requires large doses of nodal agents for rate
   control. Not on coumadin due to hx of recent GI bleed.
   - dilt gtt for HR <110, will try to titrate off as PO meds restarted
   - restart PO dilt 60mg alternating with 30mg Q6H
   - cont lopressor 25 mg po q6 hours, uptitrate as tolerated by BP
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - hold coumadin given recent GI bleed
   - monitor on tele
   # Altered Mental Status: at baseline has AMS, but responds yes/no. On
   head CT, appears to atrophy. Now with less reponsiveness. Possible
   causes include CVA (head CT without evidence), seizure (has extensive
   sz hx), and delerium related to infection. Delerium is most likely at
   this time.
   - continue depakote and primidone
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - daily valporic acid level
   - follow up FT4 level

   # C. Diff infection: had a current infection at NH on flagyl, unclear
   where pt is in his tx course
   - will continue PO flagyl while awaiting c. diff results, is on day 14
   of  course today
   - recheck C. diff today

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CVA (cerebrovascular accident), atrial fibrillation, and recurrent pneumonia. He was admitted after an episode of decreased responsiveness at his nursing home, now with concerns for pneumonia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 96.8°F (36.7°C)
- Blood pressure: 129/64 mmHg
- Heart rate: 123 bpm
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 99% on BIPAP with FiO2 40%

The patient's physical examination reveals:
- General: NAD (normal appearance, alert and oriented), sleepy but arousable, responds to some commands
- HEENT: MMM (mouth moist, mucous membranes), unable to assess OP (oral placement) while on BIPAP
- CARDIAC: RRR (regular rhythm), no murmurs, 2+ pulses in all four extremities
- LUNG: inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, rhonchi bilaterally, decreased breath sounds at base
- ABDOMEN: some distention, NT (nontender), ++BS (bulging systolic), firm
- EXT: 3+ pitting edema in feet to midcalf, 1+ in upper extremities

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of tachypnea and altered mental status. The patient is currently unresponsive and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, C. difficile infection, peripheral edema, impaired skin integrity, and colorectal cancer. The patient is receiving various medications, including diltiazem, metoprolol, heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have episodes of shortness of breath and require nebs for respiratory support. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and troponin T levels. Imaging reveals a possible left pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is already diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory complications such as worsening respiratory distress or sepsis.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): AFib can increase the risk of blood clots and stroke. The patient is on diltiazem and aspirin to manage this condition.
3. C. difficile Infection: This infection can cause severe diarrhea and may lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Peripheral Edema: The presence of edema suggests possible heart or kidney dysfunction, which can result in fluid overload or renal complications.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: Pressure ulcers or bedsores can develop due to prolonged immobility, leading to skin breakdown"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo m with hx of CVA, Afib, and recurrent PNAs who was admitted after
   an episode of decreased responsiveness at his NH, now with concern for
   PNA and afib with RVR.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: On review of CXRs appears that LLL
   effusion/infiltrate has been persistent and appears unchanged.  SOB
   episodes likely due to pt
s sensitivity to HR > 110s as he becomes
   tachypneic with increased WOB when HR > 110.  Attempted to wean off
   dilt gtt but pt HR continued to spike >120s and had to restart.  Likely
   flash pulmonary edema.

   - Liberalize morphine
   - increase dilt gtt, convert metoprolol IV
   - start digoxin for afib
   - continue ipratropium nebs q6 hours and xopenex q4 hours
   - continue chest PT and suctioning PRN
   - cont vanco/cefe/cipro for HAP coverage x 8 days (day 3)
   - ABGs as needed
   - I/O goal -1L
   - Echo
   - EKG
   # Afib with RVR: Very difficult to control. Pt requires large doses of
   nodal agents for rate control. Not on coumadin due to hx of recent GI
   bleed.
   - dilt gtt, dilt po and lopressor po
   - start digoxin today
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   - monitor on tele
   # Leukocytosis: Elevated today 17 from 12 yesterday. Afebrile, but many
   sources including lungs, stool, and wound
   - f/u blood cultures
   - need to get stool culture / c diff today
   - sputum culture
   - monitor fever curve
   - Enema if no stool today
   # Hyponatremia: Hypervolemic
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Altered Mental Status: At baseline has AMS, but responds yes/no. On
   head CT, appears to atrophy. Now with less reponsiveness. Possible
   causes include CVA (head CT without evidence), seizure (has extensive
   sz hx), and delerium related to infection.
   - continue depakote
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - daily valporic acid level
   .
   # C. Diff infection: had a current infection at NH on flagyl, pt
   completed 14 days of course yesterday.
   - f/u stool c. diff/ culture
   - monitor stool output
   - c. diff precautions
   # LE edema: chronic, unclear cause
   - continue home lasix
   .
   # Stage III ulcer: chronic ulcer, was seen during last hospitalization
   - wound care recs
   - moitor daily
   - abx as above
   .
   # Colon cancer: had colonsocpy [**9-6**] with mass at 110cm, on bx had high
   grade dyplasia. Unclear depth, since base of growth not bx. Appeared
   malignant on colonscopy. Unclear if his HCP has decided to have staging
   of the cancer or other treatment. Hx of recent GI bleed that was
   attributed to this lesion. No hx of obstruction.
   - discuss with HCP if further staging/tx will be done
   - monitor for obstruction (non seen on CT abd in ER)
   .
   # Neurogenic Bladder: chronic foley, likely from CVA hx, urine with
   positive nitrates and few bacteria but may be colonization. UCx
   negative.
   - continue foley
   - on abx above that will cover possible UTI
   .
   # Anemia: chronic, being tx with iron, has hx of recent lower GI bleed,
   and dx of colon cancer
   - continue iron supplements
   - monitor stools for blood
   - monitor hct

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of CVA, atrial fibrillation, and recurrent pneumonia. He was admitted after an episode of decreased responsiveness at his nursing home, and now there are concerns for pneumonia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has respiratory distress, likely due to flash pulmonary edema. He is being treated with IV lasix, morphine, increased diltiazem infusion, conversion of metoprolol to IV, and starting digoxin for atrial fibrillation. Other medications include ipratropium nebs q6 hours, xopenex q4 hours, vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which could be due to flash pulmonary edema. This condition requires immediate attention and treatment to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation is difficult to control, and he requires large doses of nodal agents for rate control. It is important to monitor his heart rate and adjust medications accordingly to prevent complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection and determine appropriate antibiotic coverage.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-inch tall, 81.5 kg male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, colon cancer, peripheral edema, impaired skin integrity, C. difficile infection, pneumonia, and altered mental status. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's heart rate has been in the 130s, and he has experienced tachypnea. His blood pressure has been relatively stable, ranging from 128/84 mmHg to 139/98 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes the use of a face tent and supplemental oxygen, maintaining an oxygen saturation level of 97%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 238.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,909 mL and total output of 1,580 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's current weight is 81.5 kg, with a decrease from his admission weight of 78.3 kg.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 17.5 K/uL, decreased hematocrit (Hct) at 30.5%, and decreased platelet count (Plt) at 150,000/uL. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level remains stable at 0.6 mg/dL, while troponin-T levels remain within normal range at 0.01. Other lab values are within normal limits or show minor fluctuations.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Low urine output: The patient's urine output has been decreased, which may indicate potential kidney dysfunction or dehydration.
2. Pneumonia, other: The patient has an ongoing pneumonia infection, likely contributing to his tachypnea and altered mental status.
3. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be attributed to various factors such as infection, medication effects, or underlying medical conditions.
4. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation, requiring close monitoring and management.
5. C. difficile infection (C. diff, Cdiff colitis, Clostridium difficile): The patient has a known history of C. difficile infection, which may contribute to his impaired skin integrity and altered mental status.
6. Peripheral edema: The patient's peripheral edema persists, indicating ongoing fluid retention or cardiac dysfunction.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, possibly due to decreased mobility, peripheral edema, or the C. difficile infection.
8. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), colorectal (colon cancer): The patient's medical history includes colore"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recurrent pneumonia (PNAs). The patient was admitted after an episode of decreased responsiveness at his nursing home (NH) and is now being treated for pneumonia and Afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to sensitivity to a heart rate (HR) above 110 beats per minute, leading to tachypnea and increased work of breathing (WOB). Despite attempts to wean off diltiazem (dilt gtt), the patient's HR continued to spike, so restarting dilt gtt was necessary. The patient is also on metoprolol (lopressor po) for rate control.

The patient has persistent left lower lobe (LLL) effusion/infiltrate on chest X-ray, which appears unchanged. This may be contributing to his episodes of shortness of breath (SOB).

For the management of the patient's Afib with RVR, the following plan is in place: continue dilt gtt, dilt po, and lopressor po, start digoxin for rate control, continue ipratropium nebs q6 hours, xopenex q4 hours, and monitor on tele.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath, and they are currently experiencing moderate respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate of 128 bpm and low blood pressure of 138/59 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation level is 89% while on 100% face tent oxygen delivery device.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including diltiazem, metoprolol, morphine sulfate, lorazepam (Ativan), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (Lasix), and steroids. However, the patient's condition has not improved significantly as evidenced by the continued respiratory distress, hypercarbia (elevated PCO2), and low pH indicating acidosis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (17.5 K/uL), low hemoglobin (9.7 g/dL), high potassium levels (5.58 mEq/L), and elevated lactate levels (1.8 mmol/L). The patient also has elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 113 to 150 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral lower extremity edema, warm skin, and unresponsiveness with spontaneous eye opening. The patient's respiratory chest examination shows rhonchorous breath sounds with a prolonged expiratory phase.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and recurrent pneumonia (PNAs). He was admitted after experiencing decreased responsiveness at his nursing home (NH) and is now suspected to have another episode of PNA and Afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, for which comfort measures only are being provided, and he is on a morphine drip. There is uncertainty about whether he is experiencing flash pulmonary edema, and treatment is being administered accordingly.

Additionally, the patient has a stage III ulcer, which is a chronic wound that was seen during his previous hospitalization. Wound care recommendations have been made, and it is being monitored daily. Antibiotics are being administered as previously prescribed.

Regarding ICU care, the patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being managed. He has multiple lines, including a 20-gauge line placed on October 15th. Prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are in place. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate). Disposition will involve calling out to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further episodes of PNA, development of pressure ulcers, and"

","The patient is an 78-year-old male with a history of CVA, atrial fibrillation, and recurrent pneumonia who was admitted after an episode of decreased responsiveness at his nursing home, now with concern for pneumonia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

24-hour events include setting an I/O goal of 1L (+1L), giving Lasix 60 IV x 1, and then Lasix IV 20 x 1 with minimal urine output. Dig loading was started, along with continuing Keppra and valproic acid. A TTE was completed, and an EEG showed seizures, with another EEG pending. The patient became more tachypneic, increased work of breathing, and started on noninvasive ventilation. An ABG showed respiratory acidosis. The patient was made comfort-measures-only by the healthcare proxy, and morphine sulfate was started.

Allergies: No known drug allergies.
