   presenting from OSH with altered mental status.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Per family history
   approximately 7 days of altered mental status prior to presentation.
   DDx includes Infectious (UTI, meningitis, encephalitis, cellulitis,
   PNA, osteomyeltis), Metabolic (hypoxia, hypercalcemia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, hypo/hyperthyroid, hypernatremia), Medication induced
   (opiates, withdrawl), Structural (although no evidence Normal Pressure
   Hydrocephalus), Vascular (Lupus Cerebritis, stroke), Seizure (pt with
   prior hx). Given the patient has a history of stroke per prior [**Hospital1 12**] MRI,
   SLE complications such as cognitive dysfunction, CVA, stroke, psychosis
   remain high in the differential. Other aseptic meningitidies (viral,
   TB, Fungal, SLE, Bactrim induced are also in the differential).

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-   Pt presented with A-a
   Gradient of 170 on 6L NC. No SvO2 available.Hypoxia corrects with O2,
   thus hypoxia likely [**1-15**] to V/Q mismatch. Differential included airway
   (Asthma, COPD, although no history of either per prior records),
   Alveolar (PNA, CHF, pt with clear CXR on [**12-21**] followed by evidence of
   pulmonary edema following fluid resuscitation at OSH), Vascular (PE).
   D-Dimer at OSH WNL, however elevated here to 1186, making PE potential
   etiology.  Intubated yesterday for respiratory distress.  Chronic resp
   alkalosis with mild ketoacidosis pre-intubation.  Trial of CPAP this
   morning.  Likely episode of flash pulm edema yesterday pre-intubation.
   Lung volumes improved on positive pressure ventilation.
   - Possible extubation later today if sedation is lifted and RSBI allows
   - if extubated, will likely need diuresis
   - see opiate and benzo above post-extubation
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)-  The patient is on Methadone
   40mg TID and Oxycodone 30mg TID as outpatient for vasculitis.  See

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented with altered mental status, respiratory distress, and evidence of acute systolic heart failure on top of chronic CAD. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She also has a history of chronic pain, for which she was taking methadone and oxycodone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious causes: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state due to SLE and chronic medications, there is a risk of infections such as urinary tract infection (UTI), meningitis, pneumonia, and sepsis. Empiric coverage for meningitis has been started.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's acute systolic heart failure could progress to cardiogenic shock or worsen her underlying CKD.
3. Respiratory complications: While the patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, there is still a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Antibiotics have been started empirically for this.
4. Metabolic disturbances: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. These need to be corrected to prevent further cardiac complications.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which needs to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, coronary artery disease (CAD) with a previous myocardial infarction (MI) and stenting, presenting with altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and subsequent intubation indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure due to hypoxia and ventilation-perfusion mismatch.
2. Infection: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of multiple lines and tubes, there is a high risk of infection, including pneumonia, bloodstream infection, and meningitis.
3. Heart failure: The patient's history of CAD and evidence of acute systolic heart failure suggest a risk for worsening cardiac function and fluid overload.
4. Coagulopathy: The elevated INR and history of anticoagulation therapy indicate a risk for bleeding complications.
5. SLE flare: The patient's underlying SLE may exacerbate during the course of hospitalization, leading to further organ involvement and dysfunction.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization and hypercoagulable state increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
7. Medication-induced complications: The patient is on multiple medications,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presented with altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute on chronic heart failure, and a history of type II diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious causes: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and altered mental status, there is a concern for possible infections such as urinary tract infection (UTI), meningitis, encephalitis, or pneumonia.
2. Metabolic disturbances: The patient may be at risk for electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypoxia, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypo/hyperthyroidism, and hypernatremia.
3. Medication-induced complications: Opiate use can lead to respiratory depression, while benzodiazepine use may cause sedation and worsen the patient's mental status.
4. Structural abnormalities: Although no evidence of normal pressure hydrocephalus is present, structural causes like stroke or vascular abnormalities associated with SLE should be considered.
5. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures, and this could be a potential cause of altered mental status.
6. Vascular events: Given the patient's history of stroke and CAD"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, who presented with altered mental status.
- She was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF), and her ejection fraction (EF) is 20%.
- She is also diagnosed with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and has chronic anemia.
- The patient's INR was elevated, but it has been corrected with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
- She is on multiple medications for pain control, including methadone and oxycodone.
- The patient's fever and tachypnea have been present for approximately 7 days before presentation.
- The differential diagnosis includes infectious causes like urinary tract infection (UTI), meningitis, encephalitis, cellulitis, pneumonia (PNA), osteomyelitis, as well as metabolic causes, medication-induced causes, structural causes, vascular causes, and seizure.
- The patient has been started on empiric coverage for meningitis and will continue with the same while awaiting further results.
- She will be evaluated for possible seizure activity and EEG monitoring will be considered.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to V/Q mismatch or flash pulmonary edema, and she may"

The patient has a history of chronic anemia, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), hypokalemia, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.9°F (39.4°C), blood pressure ranging from 121/85 to 132/93 mmHg, heart rate between 100 and 152 bpm, respiratory rate between 13 and 56 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (ceftazidime, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, ampicillin), sedatives (midazolam, fentanyl), pain medications (hydromorphone, morphine), and other ICU medications (furosemide, famotidine).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated troponin T, and abnormal kidney function tests. The CSF analysis shows normal glucose, WBC, and lymphocyte count, but the presence of monocytes. The fluid analysis"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease, presenting with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and acute heart failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of chronic pain and is on methadone and oxycodone. The patient also has a foot ulceration due to vasculitis and Raynaud's phenomenon. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infectious complications such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or meningitis due to the immunocompromised state of the patient with SLE and chronic kidney disease.
2. Metabolic complications like hyperkalemia or hyponatremia due to renal dysfunction.
3. Cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias due to coronary artery disease.
4. Respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma from mechanical ventilation.
5. Neurological complications such as seizures or stroke due to hypoxia or thromboembolic events.
6. Hematological complications like disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy.
7. Gastrointestinal complications such as stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.

Further evaluation and management are required to prevent and monitor these potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health summary can be summarized as follows:

- The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), presenting with altered mental status for approximately 7 days before admission.
- She has a past medical history of chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic anemia.
- The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute on chronic, with evidence of pulmonary edema and possible pulmonary embolism (PE).
- She also has pain control issues, coagulopathy with an elevated INR, acute systolic congestive heart failure, and foot ulcerations secondary to vasculitis and Raynaud's phenomenon.
- The patient is on multiple medications, including narcotics for pain management and immunosuppressive drugs for SLE.
- She has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infectious complications: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state due to SLE and medication use, she is at an increased risk of infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, or meningitis.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and chronic heart failure increases her risk of myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, or worsening heart failure.
3. Respiratory complications: Due to acute respiratory failure and potential PE, the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), presenting with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and acute heart failure on a background of chronic coronary artery disease (CAD). She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of chronic pain, diabetes mellitus type II, hypokalemia, peripheral vascular disease, and anemia. She is on long-term management for SLE with CellCept and prednisone.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient presents with approximately 7 days of altered mental status prior to presentation. The differential diagnosis includes infectious causes (UTI, meningitis, encephalitis, cellulitis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis), metabolic causes (hypoxia, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypo/hyperthyroidism, hypernatremia), medication-induced causes (opiates, withdrawal), structural causes (although no evidence of normal pressure hydrocephalus), vascular causes (lupus cerebritis, stroke), and seizure (with prior history). Given the patient's history of stroke, SLE complications such as cognitive dysfunction, CVA, stroke, psychosis remain high in the differential.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with an A-a gradient of 170 on 6L NC. Hypoxia corrects with O2, thus hypoxia likely due to"

   approximately 7 days of altered mental status prior to presentation.
   DDx includes Infectious (UTI, meningitis, encephalitis, cellulitis,
   PNA, osteomyeltis), Metabolic (hypoxia, hypercalcemia, hepatic
   encephalopathy, hypo/hyperthyroid, hypernatremia), Medication induced
   (opiates, withdrawl), Structural (although no evidence Normal Pressure
   Hydrocephalus), Vascular (Lupus Cerebritis, stroke), Seizure (pt with
   prior hx). Given the patient has a history of stroke per prior [**Hospital1 12**] MRI,
   SLE complications such as cognitive dysfunction, CVA, stroke, psychosis
   remain high in the differential. Other aseptic meningitidies (viral,
   TB, Fungal, SLE, Bactrim induced are also in the differential).  Still
   unclear etiology, infection (meningitis/encephalitis) and lupus
   cerebritis remain high on the differential.

   D-Dimer at OSH WNL, however elevated here to 1186, making PE potential
   etiology.  Intubated yesterday for respiratory distress.  Chronic resp
   alkalosis with mild ketoacidosis pre-intubation.  Trial of CPAP this
   morning.  Likely episode of flash pulm edema yesterday pre-intubation.
   Lung volumes improved on positive pressure ventilation.
   - likely extubation this morning, pt wants tube out, RSBI 25

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC-
   Patient appeared to be mildly hypervolemic on exam with evidence of
   JVP, lungs, lower extremities upon presentation.  Initially held beta
   blockade, will restart today.  TTE confirms severe systolic heart
   failure.  No evidence of endocarditis.

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)- Holding
   clopidogrel in setting of possible hemorrhage.  ? why patient is not on
   aspirin at home.
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER- ECG reveals sinus tachycardia rates have been
   110s up to 160s when patient appears agitated. Elevated troponins from
   0.02 up to 0.5 in setting of 3VD and tachycardia, likely
   stess-induced.  DDx for her tachycardia includes agitation, pain,
   withdrawl, PE, acute systolic CHF with poor forward flow, fever,
   hemorrhage.
   - cont beta blockade for improved rate control
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC- Significant Hct drop over past 24 hours.  No
   evidence of active hemorrhage on exam.  No evidence of hemolysis.  Pt
   did not receive PRBCs yesterday, Hct improved to 29 from 25 yesterday.
   - evaluate for hemolysis, active type and screen
   - goal Hct > 25
   - if Hct cont to drop, will transfuse 2 units PRBCs, non-contrast CT
   torso to eval for hemorrhage

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, presenting with altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute on chronic, and is currently intubated. She also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a previous myocardial infarction (MI) and stenting, heart failure (CHF), and chronic anemia. The patient's current medications include CellCept and Prednisone for SLE, as well as Methadone and Oxycodone for pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to immunosuppression from long-term steroid use and her underlying SLE condition. Empiric coverage for meningitis is being given due to immunosuppression.
2. Lupus Cerebritis: Given the patient's history of SLE, lupus cerebritis is a possibility and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of acute on chronic heart failure, which may require further management and optimization of cardiac medications.
4. Chronic Anemia: The patient has a chronic anemia that needs to be addressed and managed appropriately.
5. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. She presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, which has been ongoing for approximately 7 days. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a previous myocardial infarction (MI) with stenting. She is currently on long-term management with CellCept and prednisone for SLE.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 135/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory system compliance of 29. She has a right lower extremity edema but no evidence of peripheral pulses or deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin T of 0.03 ng/mL, and D-dimer of 1573 ng/mL. Other notable lab values include a slightly elevated potassium level of 5."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is altered mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Some potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to prevent further respiratory deterioration.

2. Heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) and is experiencing acute-on-chronic heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance, cardiac enzymes, and echocardiographic findings is necessary to assess the progression of heart failure.

3. Infection: The patient has received multiple antibiotics for suspected infections, and there are ongoing cultures to identify the causative organisms. Prompt identification and treatment of any infection are crucial to prevent sepsis and its associated complications.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated D-dimer levels, which may indicate a hypercoagulable state. Monitoring of coagulation parameters and considering anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent thrombotic events.

5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus. Glycemic control should be maintained to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which can contribute to altered mental status and other complications.

6. Pressure ulcer: The patient has a history of a decub"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of SLE, cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, CAD, and previous MI, presenting with altered mental status. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple systems including respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and hematological. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The differential diagnosis includes infectious causes such as meningitis, metabolic disturbances, medication-induced effects, structural abnormalities, vascular events, seizures, and lupus cerebritis. The patient also has a history of chronic heart failure, acute on chronic, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with respiratory distress and was intubated. There is a possibility of extubation if the patient's sedation is lifted and respiratory system function improves. However, post-extubation, the patient may require diuresis and monitoring for flash pulmonary edema.
2. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) with Cryoglobulinemia Vasculitis: The patient is on long-term management with CellCept and Prednisone. There is a question of whether lupus cerebritis could be the cause of altered mental status. Follow-up serologic and CSF studies are pending.
3. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic and Diastolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient appears to be mildly hypervolemic on examination"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic heart failure. She presented to the hospital with altered mental status and was found to have respiratory failure. The patient was initially intubated but has since been extubated without incident. She also has anemia, coagulopathy, and pain control issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing altered mental status for approximately 7 days prior to presentation. This could be due to various causes such as infection, metabolic disturbances, medication-induced effects, vascular events, or seizures. Close monitoring of the neurologic exam is necessary, and empirical coverage for meningitis should be continued given the patient's immunosuppression.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with an A-a gradient of 170 on 6L NC and was thought to have flash pulmonary edema. Although she was extubated yesterday, she continues to have periods of apnea with desaturation. Oxygenation should be closely monitored, and the underlying cause of respiratory failure needs to be identified.
3. SLE Flare-up: The patient has a history of SLE complicated by cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. There is a possibility that lupus cerebritis could be the etiology of the altered mental status. Long-term"

   Assessment and Plan
   42F with SLE with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis CAD s/p MI and stenting
   (EF 20%) ICD, presenting from OSH with altered mental status.
   .
   PEA ARREST:
   Unclear cause of arrest, possibly hypoxemia/hypotension in
   peri-intubation period. PE or MI also on ddx. Started on neo, dopa, IVF
   with bicarb, intubated with stable 02 sats on Fi02 100%. Lactate 15.
   - maintain CVP 10-12, use dopamine first, add on levo as needed
   - cont D5 with 150meq bicarb for acidemia
   - consult artic sun team about cooling protocol in setting of
   cryoglobulinemia
   - cycle CE, repeat TTE
   - LENIs
   - consider head CT if stable enough in PM
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)  Per family history
   approximately 7 days of altered mental status prior to presentation.
   DDx includes Infectious (encephalitis), Metabolic (hypoxia,),
   Medication induced (opiates, withdrawal), Vascular (Lupus Cerebritis,
   stroke), Seizure (pt with prior hx). Other aseptic meningitidies
   (viral, TB, Fungal, SLE, Bactrim induced are also in the
   differential).  Withdrawal process seems highest on ddx currently,
   since patient improved yesterday without high dose steroids, making SLE
   cerebritis/CNS vasculitis less likely. Pt did best while on midazolam,
   and was not getting adequate benzo
s after extubation she not taking
   POs.
   - consult psych for conservative taper regimen of benzos, keep
   comfortable on midaz for today
   - Cont empiric coverage for meningitis given immunosuppression
   (Ampicillin/Acyclovir)
   - appreciate ID recs
   - Trend and correct electrolyte disturbances
   -  appreciate Neuro recs
   - f/u OSH cultures
   - f/u Rheum recs, appreciate input
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])-   Extubated [**12-26**] then
   re-intubated for tachypnea this morning. Had periods apnea overnight (5
   sec) that were difficult to interpret- central vs. obstructive sleep
   apnea possible
   - maintain on AC, vent settings to keep pt comfortable for today
 SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE)- complicated by cryoglobulinemia
   vasculitis.  Patient currently on long term management with CellCept,
   Prednisone.  Question if lupus cerebritis could be etiology of altered
   mental status.
   - cont Cellcept, methylprednisone per Rheum, appreciate input
   - f/u numerous follow up serologic and CSF studies
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC-
   Patient appeared to be mildly hypervolemic on exam with evidence of
   JVP, lungs, lower extremities upon presentation.  TTE confirms severe
   systolic heart failure.  No evidence of endocarditis.
   - cont metoprolol
   - f/u repeat TTE
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   - cont plavix
 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER- ECG reveals sinus tachycardia rates have been
   110s up to 160s when patient appears agitated. Initially had demand
   trop leak. Improved with metoprolol yesterday. Most likely [**1-15**]
   pain/agitation/withdrawal in the setting of systolic CHF.
   - cont beta blockade for improved rate control
 ANEMIA, CHRONIC- Hct stable x 24 hours
   - active type and screen
   - trend Hct daily
 COAGULOPATHY-.  Patient has received vitamin K x 1, FFP x 2.  PT/PTT
   has normalized.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and type II diabetes mellitus. She presented to the hospital with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and heart failure. The patient was initially intubated due to respiratory failure but was extubated without incident. She required re-intubation for tachypnea and had periods of apnea overnight, possibly due to central or obstructive sleep apnea. The patient's oxygen saturation did not correlate with poor PaO2, so she was placed on high flow face mask oxygen. All cultures are negative. The patient received CPR for a PEA arrest and was treated with epinephrine. She has been on various medications including CellCept, prednisone, metoprolol, and methadone. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 121/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination reveals anxious appearance, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and muscle wasting. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, coagulopathy, type II diabetes mellitus,"
