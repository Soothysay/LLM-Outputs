","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 37-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and a previous renal transplant, presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute renal failure (ARF). She was initially unable to tolerate oral intake, so her immunosuppressive medications were changed to intravenous (IV) formulations. The patient received approximately 5 liters of IV fluids yesterday and the fluids were changed to D5W due to hypernatremia, which has since been corrected. She was restarted on d51/2NS. Insulin was administered via intravenous infusion, starting at 29 units per hour and has been weaned down to 2 units per hour. The patient's serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test was negative. 

The patient has several allergies, including penicillins, erythromycin base, codeine, sulfa, and dipentum (olsalazine sodium). She received pantoprazole (Protonix) at 08:11 PM on [date]. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: the patient is uncomfortable and ill appearing, with an irregular erythema on the posterior pharynx but no exudate. She also has a tracheostomy in place. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure"

- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose levels, and slightly elevated creatinine and potassium levels.
- Chest X-ray reveals an unremarkable cardiomediastinal contour and clear lungs.
- The patient is currently receiving IV fluids, insulin, pantoprazole, and other medications as needed.
- The patient's condition is improving, but she still requires close monitoring and management of her various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's high WBC count and symptoms such as throat pain and possible upper airway localizing symptoms may indicate an infection. Further investigation is needed to confirm this.
2. Abscess: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and a recent renal transplant. She was admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's medical history also includes hypotension, hypothyroidism, anemia, hypercholesterolemia, depression, and a history of dialysis catheter infection.

24-hour events:
- The patient was unable to tolerate oral intake, so her immunosuppressants were changed to intravenous administration.
- Tacrolimus was given sublingually, and cellcept IV was started.
- The patient received approximately 5 liters of intravenous fluids yesterday and was switched to D5W due to hypernatremia. Her fluids were then restarted on d51/2NS.
- Insulin was administered at a maximum rate of 29 units per hour and was gradually weaned down to 2 units per hour.
- The patient's serum HCG test was negative.

Allergies:
- The patient has allergies to penicillins, erythromycin base, codeine, sulfa (sulfonamides), dipentum (olsalazine sodium), and dilaudid (hydromorphone HCl/PF).

Current vital signs:
- Temperature: 37.6Â°C (99.7Â°F)
- Heart rate: 98 beats per minute
- Blood pressure:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and recent renal transplant, presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, coffee ground emesis, EKG changes, and anemia. She is currently in the ICU receiving aggressive treatment for DKA, including insulin gtt, IV fluids, and electrolyte repletion. The patient's immunosuppression medications were temporarily stopped due to her condition but need to be restarted as soon as possible. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoglycemia: Due to the high dose of insulin being administered, there is a risk of hypoglycemia.
2. Hyperkalemia: Insulin therapy can drive potassium into cells, leading to a drop in serum potassium levels, potentially causing hyperkalemia.
3. Hypophosphatemia: Insulin therapy can also cause a shift of phosphate into cells, resulting in hypophosphatemia.
4. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to immunosuppressive therapy, making her more susceptible to infections.
5. Fluid overload: Aggressive IV fluids given during resuscitation may lead to fluid overload, especially in a patient with renal dysfunction.
6. Hypertension: Once the patient's glucose levels are normalized, there is a possibility of developing hypertension due"

   37 yo F with DM1, s/p renal transplant p/w DKA and ARF.
   .
   # DKA: Unclear precipitant. Could be pump malfunction, although
   infection is on the differential despite no localizing symptoms given
   leukocytosis and left shift and elevated lactate. CE's flat, lateral
   changes could be secondary to rate. Insulin gtt is likely not working
   as well as it should given high dose steroids.
   - insulin gtt, currently at 10units/hr, need to increase given
   worsening of acid base status on second chem 7
   - aggressive IVF repletion with 1/2 NS now x 3L
   - replete K
   - check pH; if less than 7.0, can give 50meq nabicarb over 45 minutes
   - q2h lytes to follow AG for next 6 hours
   - Decrease insulin by [**1-4**] units/hr when glucose is less than 250
   - once gap is closed, continue insulin gtt at 0.5 - 1 unit per hour and
   start D5 gtt once glucose <100
   - once patient able to eat, can give subcut insulin and shut gtt off
   - send urine cx
   - check TSH
   .
   # ARF: likely prerenal azotemia on top of CRI given DKA. Will follow
   creatinine with IVF. Continue immunosuppression with steroids for now.
   - send urine lytes, urine cx
   - IVF
   .
   # Hypotension: patient has longstanding hypotension for which she eats
   a high salt diet and takes florinef. She was unable to take florinef
   today which is compounded by marked hypovolemia from DKA.
   - IVF, restart florinef
   .
   # Coffee ground emesis - likely [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear as patient had
   frequent emesis during the day. Start ppi IV bid, guaiac stools,
   monitor hct. Send T&S.
   .
   # EKG changes - are likely rate related in the setting of borderline
   LVH. Trops are mildly elevated in the setting of renal failure, but
   CK/MB flat.
   .
   # S/p Renal Tx: check [**Last Name (un) **]/tac levels in AM. It is very important for
   her to restart her immunosuppressants and high dose steroids makes
   glucose control very difficult. Will switch cellcept to IV and attempt
   to pre-medicate with anti-emetics for pt to try to take [**Last Name (un) **]/tac.

   # Hypothyroidism: IV synthroid until taking PO

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and a renal transplant who presented to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute renal failure (ARF). She is currently receiving IV fluids, insulin, and has been weaned off mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood glucose levels are being closely monitored, and her electrolytes are being repleted. She is also receiving medications to prevent stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Complications:
1. Hyperkalemia: Due to the patient's ARF, there is a risk of elevated potassium levels. Monitoring of potassium levels is essential, and if needed, measures should be taken to lower it, such as calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, or insulin with glucose.

2. Hypoglycemia: With the insulin therapy, there is a risk of low blood sugar levels. Frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent and treat hypoglycemia.

3. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, which could be exacerbated by the ongoing DKA and ARF. IV fluids and vasopressors may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

4. Infection: Despite no localizing symptoms, leukocytosis and left shift suggest the possibility of an infection. Cultures have been obtained, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered if necessary.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetes, who was admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She is also a renal transplant recipient. The patient has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and severe external neck pain. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.7 F), blood pressure of 121/65 mmHg, heart rate of 106 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on an insulin drip and D5NS running. 

Her laboratory results show a high white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hypernatremia (high sodium), hypophosphatemia (low phosphate), and hypercalcemia (high calcium). Her renal function tests indicate acute kidney injury with an elevated creatinine level. The patient is also anemic with a low hemoglobin level.

The patient's medical history includes a history of DKA, mechanical failure of an insulin pump, renal transplant, persistent nausea and vomiting, throat pain, and hoarseness of voice. The patient's current medications include tacrolimus, cellcept, and pantoprazole. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's renal function, further electrolyte imbalances, infections due to immunosuppression from the medications, and potential complications from the throat infection. Close monitoring of the patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and a previous renal transplant. She presented to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute renal failure (ARF). 

The patient's medical conditions include DKA, ARF, hypotension, hypothyroidism, anemia, hypercholesterolemia, depression, and potential upper airway infection. She also has a history of renal transplantation and is currently on immunosuppressive medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. DKA: The patient's blood glucose levels were initially very high, which required insulin infusions to achieve glycemic control. There is a risk of recurrent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia if insulin dosing is not adjusted properly.
2. ARF: The patient's renal function is impaired, which may require adjustments to her immunosuppressive medications and fluid management. There is a risk of worsening renal function or electrolyte imbalances if not closely monitored.
3. Hypotension: The patient's longstanding hypotension may require ongoing management with IV fluids and medications such as Florinef. There is a risk of volume overload or electrolyte imbalances if fluid administration is not carefully controlled.
4. Upper airway infection: The patient's symptoms of odynophagia and throat pain suggest a possible upper air"

   37 yo F with DM1, s/p renal transplant p/w DKA and ARF.
   # DKA: Unclear precipitant. Could be pump malfunction, although
   infection is on the differential and now she has possible upper airway
   localizing symptoms.  Especially given difficulty keeping BG under
   control and keeping AG closed.  Requiring much more insulin gtt than
   what she was getting by pump at home. CE's flat, lateral changes could
   be secondary to rate.
   - difficulty controlling glucose with wide fluxuations.  At euglycemia
 give lantus 30U (basal rate at home), continue drip at 2U/hr and
   titrate accordingly
   - cont IV repletion with d5 and bicarb
   - replete K
   - q 4 hour lytes
   - once patient able to eat, can give subcut insulin and shut gtt off
   - send urine cx
   .
   # Throat pain: also has possible area of infection in posterior
   pharynx.  CT unable to see abscess.
   - start clinda/levo (PCN allergy, so no unasyn)
   - discuss with neurorads re: MRI best next modality.
   # ARF: likely prerenal azotemia on top of CRI given DKA. Will follow
   creatinine with IVF. Continue immunosuppression.   Improving.
   - send urine lytes, urine cx
   - IVF
   .
   # Hypotension: patient has longstanding hypotension for which she eats
   a high salt diet and takes florinef. She was unable to take florinef
   leading up to admission  which is compounded by marked hypovolemia from
   DKA.
   - IVF, cont florinef
   .
   # Coffee ground emesis - likely [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear as patient had
   frequent emesis during the day. Start ppi IV bid, guaiac negative,
   monitor hct. No further coffee ground emesis.  activeT&S.
   .
   # EKG changes - are likely rate related in the setting of borderline
   LVH. Trops are mildly elevated in the setting of renal failure, but
   CK/MB flat.

   # S/p Renal Tx: tacro being given sublingual.  Cellcept IV.
   - follow renal transplant recs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1 and a history of renal transplantation. She presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's condition has been managed with aggressive IV fluid repletion, insulin infusion to control blood glucose levels, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. She has also received antibiotics for possible infection in the posterior pharynx, and an MRI is pending to further evaluate this.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 157/82 mmHg and a heart rate of 92 bpm. Her respiratory rate is normal, and her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. Kidney function tests indicate some impairment, but not severe. Liver function tests are within normal range. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating but are now under control.

The patient has a history of hypotension, for which she takes Florinef and follows a high salt diet. She also has hypothyroidism, anemia, hypercholesterolemia, and depression, all being managed with respective medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include persistent hyperglycemia if insulin infusion is not maintained, further deterioration of renal function, development of bloodstream infection due to indwelling lines, and potential respiratory complications from the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of renal transplant, currently experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to mechanical failure of an insulin pump.
- The patient presents with high blood sugar levels, acidosis, and anion gap fluctuations, which are all indicative of DKA.
- The patient has been treated with insulin infusions and has shown improvement.
- The patient also has hypernatremia (high sodium) and hypophosphatemia (low phosphate), which are common complications associated with DKA.
- The patient's nausea and vomiting are under control with antiemetics.
- There is a concern for possible thrush or soft tissue abscess in the throat, as indicated by symptoms such as throat pain and hoarseness.
- The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, antifungal medication, and proton pump inhibitor.
- The patient's renal function is improving with hydration, but she is still experiencing acute-on-chronic renal failure.
- The patient is not taking sirolimus as prescribed and is advised to discuss options for renal transplant with a specialist.
- The patient's condition is critically ill, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU, the patient is at risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, particularly in the legs.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneum"

","The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of renal transplant, currently admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to insulin pump failure. She also has an upper respiratory infection, suspected to be caused by either thrush, inflammation, or infection, possibly a retropharyngeal abscess. The patient is being treated with fluconazole, levaquin, and clindamycin. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 153/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is alert and oriented, with no significant abnormalities on physical examination except for petechiae and erythema, possible ulceration over the palate and posterior pharyngeal wall. 

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, anion gap metabolic acidosis, high white blood cell count, low hemoglobin and hematocrit, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hypernatremia and hypophosphatemia. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's renal function is improving with hydration, but she has leukocytosis and is at risk for infection. 

The patient is receiving insulin infusion for glycemic control, and her DKA is resolving. She is also receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yo F with DM1, s/p renal transplant p/w DKA and ARF.
   # DKA: Unclear precipitant. Could be pump malfunction, although
   infection is on the differential and now she has possible upper airway
   infection.  Achieved BG control with SC lantus and weaning insulin
   gtt.  AG now closed and bicarb improved.
   - cont lantus 30U qday and start SSI, follow [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs for adjustment
   (appreciate input).
   - d/c bicarb as bicarb improved, cont d5 while not eating
   - replete K prn
   - q 8 hour lytes
   - ADAT
   - f/u cultures and upper airway infection workup as below.
   .
   # Throat pain: also has possible area of infection in posterior
   pharynx.  CT unable to see abscess.  MRI showed smaller area, no fluid
   collection or mass.  ENT involed (appreciate input), patient has
   refused scope.  Now has signs of thrush as well.
   - cont clinda/levo (PCN allergy, so no unasyn)
   - repeat MRI in 2 days
   - f/u throat culture data still (pending)
   - cont fluconazoel
   - magic mouthwash for pain control and assistance in taking PO meds
   .
   # ARF: likely prerenal azotemia on top of CRI given DKA as well as
   possible contribution from inability to take immunosuppressives. Will
   follow creatinine with IVF. Continue immunosuppression (not taking
   sirolimus while unable to take PO).   Acute renal failure mproving.
   - IVF
   - follow
   - follow renal transplant recs (appreciate input)
   - follow tacro level, change to PO when taking PO
   - encourage PO for sirolimus
   .
   # Hypotension: patient has longstanding hypotension for which she eats
   a high salt diet and takes florinef. She was unable to take florinef
   leading up to admission which is compounded by marked hypovolemia from
   DKA.
   - IVF prn
   - restart florinef when taking POs
   .
   # HTN: hypertensive today, possibly secondary to recent increased
   tacro.  Usually hypotensive, so reticent to treat HTN.
   - follow, treat prn if necessary
   # S/p Renal Tx: tacro being given sublingual.  Cellcept IV.
   - follow renal transplant recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old female who underwent renal transplantation and is currently in the ICU. She has a history of resolved diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), throat pain with thrush, and a suspected retropharyngeal (RP) abscess on CT/MRI neck. The patient is refusing an ENT scope. Her current conditions include nausea/vomiting, hypernatremia (high sodium), hypophosphatemia (low phosphate), and acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient is experiencing non-productive retching, which could lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient's DKA has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence if her blood glucose levels become uncontrolled or if she has poor oral intake.
3. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient's high sodium levels can increase the risk of dehydration and neurological complications.
4. Hypophosphatemia (Low Phosphate): Low phosphate levels can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac dysfunction, and respiratory distress.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's acute worsening of chronic renal failure requires careful management of fluid and electrolyte balance, as well as monitoring for any signs of further deterioration.
6. Throat Pain with Thrush: The presence of thrush indicates an immunocompromised"
