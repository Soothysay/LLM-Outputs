","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of heart failure (diastolic), dementia (including Alzheimer's, multi-infarct), and falls. The patient is currently receiving infusions of nitroglycerin and furosemide (Lasix). They have allergies to verapamil and NSAIDs, but the nature of these allergies is unknown. The patient has received antibiotics, but the last dose is not specified.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 73 bpm (with a range of 72-84 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 85/44 mmHg to 164/128 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute (with a range of 14-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 92% on a face tent. The patient's heart rhythm is paced. The patient has received a total of 734 mL of fluid intake and 745 mL of fluid output, resulting in a balance of -11 mL.

The patient's blood products show a total output of 745 mL and 300 mL, while urine output is also 745 mL and 300 mL. The patient's NG (nasogastric) tube output is not recorded, and stool and drain outputs are not assessed. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.3"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yr old with hx of ILD ? related to RA, ex-smoker, with acute
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and evidence of CHF based on
   presentation, exam, BNP and xray. The history of ILD and smoking hx
   (?COPD) likely playing added role to reduced respiratory reserve. Her
   dementia raises suspicion for aspiration. Unlikely pneumonia with
   sepsis given lack of fever or leukocytosis.
   Seems to be showing signs of improvement so far, with diuresis of about
   750 cc. Agree with ruling out MI (neg trop x 1), holding
   midodrine/fluorinef, aspiration precautions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) related to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), previous smoker, and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. She also has atrial flutter, congestive heart failure (CHF), pacemaker, and dementia. The patient presented with hypoxemia and was found to have pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia after falling at a nursing home. Her initial oxygen saturation was 79% on room air, improved to mid-90's on nasal high-flow oxygen (NRB). The patient did not show signs of distress or tachypnea. She was not able to answer questions reliably due to dementia. In the emergency department, her oxygen saturation improved from 84 on room air to 94% on 4 liters nasal cannula, but remained low on BiPAP. She had crackles in both lung fields bilaterally and an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 3284. Troponin was negative, and she had a ventricular-paced rhythm with no signs of distress. She was placed on BiPAP 10/5, nitroglycerin, and lasix. Her vital signs upon admission were within normal limits, but her blood pressure increased slightly upon transfer to the ICU. The patient received 650ml of oral intake and produced 745ml of urine.

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atrial flutter post pacemaker placement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and dementia. She was admitted for hypoxia and fell at her nursing home yesterday. An X-ray of her pelvic and lower back showed no abnormalities. This morning, she was found to be hypoxic with an oxygen saturation level of 79% on room air, which improved to mid-90s on nasal high-flow oxygen. 

In the emergency department, the patient arrived hypoxic, with oxygen saturation levels at 84% on room air and 88% on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen, but improved to 94% on nasal high-flow oxygen. She was not tachypneic or in distress. A chest X-ray revealed pulmonary edema, and a physical examination showed crackles in the lung fields bilaterally. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were elevated at 3284. Troponin levels were negative, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated an old ventricular-paced rhythm with no signs of Sgarbossa criteria. 

The patient was placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) 10/5, nitroglycerin, and lasix intravenously. She produced 650ml of urine output. Her initial vital signs included a temperature of 97.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 134/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal high-flow oxygen. Upon transfer, her vital signs were as follows: ventricular-paced rhythm in the 70's with left bundle branch block, afebrile at 155/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on BiPAP.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient experienced delirium, which was managed with haloperidol. She transitioned to nasal cannula oxygen. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed upper lobe predominant fibrotic changes. 

The patient has allergies to verapamil and unknown NSAIDs. Her last dose of antibiotics was infusions of nitroglycerin, which was turned off. She received various ICU medications, including furosemide (lasix) at 09:57 PM. Other medications included plaquenil 200mg, prednisone 10mg, heparin subcutaneously, calcium carbonate, citalopram (celexa) 20mg, omeprazole (prilosec) 20mg, peridex, levothyroxine (synthroid) 88mcg, and midodrine/florinef (held).

   hypoxemic respiratory failure.  There was evidence of CHF based on
   presentation, exam, BNP and xray and her oxygenation did improve with
   lasix.  However her chest CT shows extensive fibrotic changes that are
   upper lobe predominent, which is suggestive of RA related pulmonary
   fibrosis.  Given her dementia and poor functional status she is a poor
   candidate for high dose steoids or cytoxan but nevertheless worth a
   limited rheum workup to at least evaluate evidence of an active
   inflammatory process.  Clinically she is stable and comfortable on 5L

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atrial flutter, pacemaker placement, congestive heart failure (CHF), and dementia. The patient was admitted for hypoxia and had fallen at the nursing home the previous day. The X-ray of the pelvic and lower back region was unremarkable. 

The patient was found to be hypoxic, with oxygen saturation levels ranging from 79% to mid-90's on room air and improved to mid-90's on nasal high flow. The patient was not in distress or tachypneic. In the emergency department, the patient arrived hypoxic but was not tachypneic or in distress. A chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema, and physical examination revealed crackles in both lung fields. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were elevated at 3284, and troponin was negative. An EKG showed an old ventricular-paced rhythm at 70 beats per minute, with negative Sgarbossa's criteria. 

The patient was placed on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) 10/5, nitroglycerin, and lasix 20mg intravenously. On admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature 97.1°F, heart rate 72 bpm, blood pressure 134/73 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation on room air at 93%. On transfer to the ICU, the patient's vital signs were: ventricular-paced rhythm in the 70's, left bundle branch block, afebrile, blood pressure 155/76 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation on BiPAP at 94%.

During the 24-hour period, the patient experienced delirium and was administered haloperidol. The patient transitioned to nasal cannula oxygen and chest CT showed upper lobe predominant fibrotic changes. 

The patient's allergies include verapamil, unknown NSAIDs, and unknown antibiotics. The last dose of antibiotics was infused. The patient was receiving nitroglycerin, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. The patient's other medications included Plaquenil, prednisone, heparin subcutaneously, calcium carbonate, Celexa, Prilosec, Peridex, Synthroid, and midodrine/florinef (held).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for hypoxia. Flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.3 thousand cells/microliter, hematocrit of 27.3%, platelet count of 275 thousand cells/microliter, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose levels ranging from 117 to 99 mg/dL, and troponin T levels below 0.01 ng/mL. Other lab results include calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and electrolyte levels.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. The patient is a 79-year-old with a history of ILD related to RA, ex-smoker, with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. There was evidence of CHF based on presentation, exam, BNP, and X-ray, and oxygenation improved with lasix. However, the chest CT shows extensive fibrotic changes that are upper lobe predominant, which is suggestive of RA-related pulmonary fibrosis. Given the patient's dementia and poor functional status, she is a poor candidate for high-dose steroids or cyclophosphamide but is worth a limited rheum workup to evaluate for an active inflammatory process.
2. The patient has heart failure (CHF), specifically diastolic heart failure, acute on chronic, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is recommended to assess ejection fraction.
3. The patient has a history of dementia, possibly secondary to rheumatoid arthritis.
4. The patient's hypoxemia has decreased FiO2 requirement but is not back to baseline and requires continued supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.
5. The patient has a history of falls.
6. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI), and she is being transferred to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of CHF, exacerbation of RA-related pulmonary fibrosis, further episodes of hypoxemia, delirium, and falls."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atrial flutter with pacemaker, congestive heart failure (CHF), and dementia. She was admitted for hypoxia and presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and evidence of CHF. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 97.1°F, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 134/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. The patient is currently on BiPAP, nitroglycerin, and lasix. She has been producing urine output of 650ml. The patient's allergies include verapamil, unknown NSAIDs, and unknown antibiotics. The patient's medical history includes a fall at the nursing home yesterday, with an unremarkable pelvic and lower back X-ray. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and evidence of CHF raise concerns for possible pneumonia, which can be a common complication in patients with compromised respiratory function.
2. Aspiration: The patient's dementia raises suspicion for aspiration, as individuals with cognitive impairments may have difficulty swallowing and could inhale food or liquids into their lungs.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and advanced age are risk factors for developing DVT. Close monitoring of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial flutter, and dementia. She was admitted for hypoxia and is currently in the ICU. She has been experiencing diffuse inspiratory crackles bilaterally, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, edema on chest X-ray, and hypoxia, suggesting pulmonary edema. She is also borderline hypertensive with a blood pressure of 118/84 mmHg and has a history of low blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension. Troponin-T levels are negative, indicating no acute myocardial infarction. She has no fever or chest pain, making chemical pneumonitis less likely. She received Lasix and nitroglycerin infusions in the emergency department, which resulted in diuresis of 650 mL. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is alert and oriented. She has non-pitting edema around her ankles and no tenderness to palpation of hips or back. Neurologic examination reveals mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of diffuse inspiratory crackles, elevated BNP levels, and edema on chest X-ray suggest acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary edema. Monitoring her oxygenation and providing supportive care will be important.
2. Hypotension/Octopamine: The patient's history of orthost"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of heart failure (diastolic), atrial flutter, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), dementia, spinal stenosis, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and has been experiencing several medical complications.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 118/84 mmHg to 164/128 mmHg, heart rate between 73-84 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 92%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a face tent and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH of 7.27.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse inspiratory crackles bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with no murmurs, supple neck, and no jugular venous distention (JVD) or carotid bruits. The abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds, and there is non-pitting edema around the ankles. Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 9.0 g/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 140 mg/dL, potassium (K+) level of 3.7 mEq/L, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9 mg/dL, troponin T level of <0.01, and glucose level of 117 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has multiple medical problems including chronic heart failure, dementia, RA, atrial flutter, spinal stenosis, hypothyroidism, and a history of falls. She is currently being treated with various medications such as nitroglycerin, furosemide (Lasix), Haldol, and others.

The assessment and plan section indicates several ongoing issues including hypoxia, RA, atrial flutter, fall, orthostatic hypotension, hypothyroidism, spinal stenosis, and dementia. The healthcare team is monitoring the patient closely and making adjustments to her treatment plan accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and medical history include exacerbation of heart failure, respiratory infections, worsening of COPD, further falls due to dementia or orthostatic hypotension, and complications related to the patient's multiple medications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and cardiac function. Frequent reassessment of laboratory values and regular echocardiograms may be necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the patient's treatment plan. Additionally, ongoing communication with the healthcare team and family members is crucial to ensure the best possible care for the patient."

   is likely [**1-1**] pulmonary edema; however, the patient does not have JVD
   or pedal edema which suggests that she is not whole body overloaded.
   This suggests that she may have had flash pulmonary edema. She is

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atrial flutter, congestive heart failure (CHF), pacemaker, and dementia. She was admitted for hypoxia and has been diagnosed with extensive ILD and ground glass opacities on imaging. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), crackles on auscultation, and edema on chest X-ray. She has been treated with BiPap, lasix, and nitroglycerin in the emergency department and received a negative fluid balance of 1.2 liters yesterday. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 161/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula. Her lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated troponin T level, and other abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms, including hypoxia, crackles on auscultation, and elevated BNP, suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. This condition occurs when fluid accumulates in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.
2. Flash pulmonary edema: Given the absence of jugular venous distention"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atrial flutter, congestive heart failure (CHF), pacemaker, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia. The patient had previously been on BiPAP but was weaned off and transferred to the floor. She was then brought back to the ICU due to hypoxia and nursing concerns. The assessment suggests that the patient likely has a combination of CHF and ILD. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3 C (97.3 F), heart rate of 68 bpm with a range of 66-77 bpm, blood pressure of 161/57 mmHg with a range of 106/56-185/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute with a range of 10-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is also on prophylactic heparin and has a nasogastric tube in place.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, platelet count of 275 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, troponin-T level of <0.01, glucose level of 117 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is awake, alert, and in no acute distress. Her neck is supple with decreased jugular venous distention. Lung auscultation reveals diffuse crackles bilaterally. The cardiac examination shows regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. The abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds. The extremities show no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, but the ankles are swollen but firm with 2+ distal pulses. The neurologic examination is normal.

The patient has several medical conditions, including hypoxia, CHF, ILD, RA, atrial flutter, and dementia. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypoxia, exacerbation of CHF, progression of ILD, and complications related to her other comorbidities such as RA and atrial flutter. It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, cardiac function, and renal function."
