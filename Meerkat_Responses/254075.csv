   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Pt with dyspnea and hypoxia with evidence of fluid
   overload clinically and on CXR c/w her history of severe and tenuous
   dCHF; BNP 6666. She describes an acute onset which raises concern for
   an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis but no fevers, cough, or clear
   consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic afib but rate
   controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2 sets CE neg. PE
   possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or hemoptysis; she
   does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as hematoma). Question
   component of reactive airways disease given earlier response to
   albuterol although no h/o COPD and no wheezes on exam currently.
   Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute decompensation.  Per
   daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past week already; there
   may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med compliance in this pt with
   baseline dCHF that has been very difficult to manage. Pt did report
   that she vomited up possibly some of her medications recently.
   - Diuresis currently limited by BP; will try to wean of levophed and
   start lasix gtt for diuresis when able. Pt currently self diuresing
   decently; suspect due to improved BPs on levophed
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Consider repeat [**Name (NI) **]
   - Pt reports stable LLE edema; consider bilateral LENIs to r/o DVT -
   would hold off on CTA chest for now given ARF
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] notified of admission; he will stop by today; suggests
   possible need for ultrafiltration
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping; stable Hct suggests that this is more a slow
   bleed.  Pt with mild leukocytosis but no evidence of sepsis at this
   time. CVL placed. UA mildly inflammatory; culture pending.
   - Cipro started [**4-1**] for empiric treatment of UTI
   - Will try to wean off levophed for now; suboptimal given dCHF
   - Holding diuretics for now given stable respiratory status but will
   need to
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC for now
   .
   # Hematochezia: Recent admission for anemia; thought to have recurrent
   lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with guaiac positive dark
   stools but stable Hct since last discharge.  Most c/w LGIB again rather
   than UGIB.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] notified
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 (baseline 1.7) Likely decreased
   renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart failure and
   hypotension. Did have ARF on last admission and was found to have urine
   eos on last admission and mesalamine initially held due to reports of
   AIN with this but restarted when stabilized; eventually thought more
   likely from prerenal azotemia.
   - FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%
   - Plan for diuresis as above
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] notified; asked for renal consult to see pt this AM, and
   he will follow while in house; consider a course of ultrafiltration
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Diuresis as above

   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.
   - Zofran prn
   - Monitor for now
   .
   # Afib: Stable with slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated
   secondary to GI bleeding
   - hold metoprolol for now in setting of hypotension

   # Ulcerative colitis: Does not seem to be in a UC flare, no increase in
   diarrhea, no abdominal cramping
   - Continue asacol 800mg tid

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleed presenting with acute dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient is hypotensive and requires pressors. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 109/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a controlled rate.

The patient has leukocytosis but no signs of infection. The patient has chronic left lower extremity edema and a history of chronic atrial fibrillation. The patient reports worsening symptoms over the past week, which may be due to suboptimal dietary and medication compliance.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, indicative of heart failure. The patient's urine osmolarity is high, suggesting dehydration. The patient has mild elevations in liver enzymes, likely due to congestive hepatopathy.

The patient's current medications include norepinephrine infusion at 0.06 mcg/kg/min, ciprofloxacin for suspected urinary tract infection, albuterol as needed for respiratory symptoms, and home medications such as spironol"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She presented with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, which raised concern for an inciting event. The patient is currently on multiple medications including norepinephrine, ciprofloxacin, lasix, metolazone, spironolactone, torsemide, and albuterol.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/58 mmHg to 133/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula, and temperature within normal limits. She is in atrial fibrillation with a controlled rate.

   an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis but no fevers, cough, or clear
   consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic afib but rate
   controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2 sets CE neg. PE
   possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or hemoptysis; she
   does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as hematoma). Question
   component of reactive airways disease given earlier response to
   albuterol although no h/o COPD and no wheezes on exam currently.
   Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute decompensation.  Per
   daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past week already; there
   may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med compliance in this pt with
   baseline dCHF that has been very difficult to manage.
   - Diuresis currently limited by BP; will try to wean of levophed and
   start lasix gtt for diuresis when able. Pt currently self diuresing
   decently; suspect due to improved BPs on levophed
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Add on TSH
   - Consider repeat [**Name (NI) **]

   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 (baseline 1.7) Likely decreased
   renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart failure and
   hypotension. Did have ARF on last admission and was found to have urine
   eos on last admission and mesalamine initially held due to reports of
   AIN with this but restarted when stabilized; eventually thought more
   likely from prerenal azotemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 63-year-old female with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleed.
- She presented with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, along with evidence of fluid overload clinically and on chest X-ray.
- Her leukocyte count is elevated, but there are no signs of pneumonia.
- She has chronic atrial fibrillation but with rate control.
- There are no clear signs of acute coronary syndrome or pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has chronic lower extremity edema, now worsening on the same leg as a hematoma.
- There may be a component of suboptimal dietary/medication compliance in this patient with baseline dCHF.
- The patient's blood pressure is currently low and is being supported with norepinephrine.
- She is receiving diuretics but diuresis is currently limited by her blood pressure.
- She has mild leukocytosis but no evidence of sepsis.
- The patient has a history of anemia thought to be caused by recurrent lower gastrointestinal angioectasia bleeding.
- She has guaiac-positive dark stools but stable hemoglobin since last discharge.
- Her renal function has worsened with an increase in BUN and creatinine levels.
- She has elevated liver function tests"

   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Patient with severe diastolic heart failure, severe
   TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She describes an acute onset which
   raises concern for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis but no fevers,
   cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic
   afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2
   sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or
   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Question component of reactive airways disease given earlier
   response to albuterol although no h/o COPD and no wheezes on exam
   currently.  Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.

   [**4-1**] CXR: Increased right and continued left pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Pt with dyspnea and hypoxia with evidence of fluid
   overload clinically and on CXR c/w her history of severe and tenuous
   dCHF; BNP 6666. She describes an acute onset which raises concern for
   an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis but no fevers, cough, or clear
   consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic afib but rate
   controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2 sets CE neg. PE
   possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or hemoptysis; she
   does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as hematoma). Question
   component of reactive airways disease given earlier response to
   albuterol although no h/o COPD and no wheezes on exam currently.
   Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute decompensation.  Per
   daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past week already; there
   may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med compliance in this pt with
   baseline dCHF that has been very difficult to manage. Pt did report
   that she vomited up possibly some of her medications recently.
   - Diuresis currently limited by BP; will try to wean of levophed and
   start lasix gtt for diuresis when able. Pt currently self diuresing
   decently; suspect due to improved BPs on levophed
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Consider repeat [**Name (NI) **]
   - Pt reports stable LLE edema; consider bilateral LENIs to r/o DVT -
   would hold off on CTA chest for now given ARF
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] notified of admission; he will stop by today; suggests
   possible need for ultrafiltration
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping; stable Hct suggests that this is more a slow
   bleed.  Pt with mild leukocytosis but no evidence of sepsis at this
   time. CVL placed. UA mildly inflammatory; culture pending.
   - Cipro started [**4-1**] for empiric treatment of UTI
   - Will try to wean off levophed for now; suboptimal given dCHF
   - Holding diuretics for now given stable respiratory status but will
   need to
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC for now
   .
   # Hematochezia: Recent admission for anemia; thought to have recurrent
   lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with guaiac positive dark
   stools but stable Hct since last discharge.  Most c/w LGIB again rather
   than UGIB.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] notified
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 (baseline 1.7) Likely decreased
   renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart failure and
   hypotension. Did have ARF on last admission and was found to have urine
   eos on last admission and mesalamine initially held due to reports of
   AIN with this but restarted when stabilized; eventually thought more
   likely from prerenal azotemia.
   - FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%
   - Plan for diuresis as above
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] notified; asked for renal consult to see pt this AM, and
   he will follow while in house; consider a course of ultrafiltration
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Diuresis as above
   .
   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.
   - Zofran prn
   - Monitor for now
   .
   # Afib: Stable with slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated
   secondary to GI bleeding
   - hold metoprolol for now in setting of hypotension
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: Does not seem to be in a UC flare, no increase in
   diarrhea, no abdominal cramping
   - Continue asacol 800mg tid
   .
   # H/o DM: Not on hypoglycemics.
   - Insulin sliding scale for now
   # Restless legs.
   - Takes gabapentin at home; will restart tonight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed presenting with acute dyspnea and hypoxia. She is currently hypotensive on pressors and has evidence of fluid overload clinically and on chest X-ray. The patient has leukocytosis but no signs of pneumonia. She has chronic atrial fibrillation but her rate is controlled. There are no clear signs of acute coronary syndrome or pulmonary embolism, but there is a possibility of chronic leg edema. The patient's symptoms may have been worsening over the past week, and there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/medication compliance in this patient with baseline CHF. She reports vomiting up some of her medications recently.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient's dyspnea and hypoxia are consistent with her history of severe and tenuous diastolic CHF. A B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 6666 is indicative of acute decompensation. The patient may have an inciting event. She has leukocytosis but no fever, cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia. The patient is in chronic atrial fibrillation but rate-controlled. No coronary chest pain (CP) suggests acute coronary syndrome"

   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Patient with severe diastolic heart failure, severe
   TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She describes an acute onset which
   raises concern for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis but no fevers,
   cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic
   afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2
   sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or
   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Question component of reactive airways disease given earlier
   response to albuterol although no h/o COPD and no wheezes on exam
   currently.  Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.
   - Repeat TTE unchanged from prior
   - Episode of chest pain on [**4-2**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin

   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.

   Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart
   failure and hypotension. Did have ARF on last admission and was found
   to have urine eos on last admission and mesalamine initially held due

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She presents with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, which raises concern for an inciting event. The patient has leukocytosis but no fevers, cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia. She is in chronic atrial fibrillation but rate-controlled, with no chest pain to suggest acute coronary syndrome; EKG baseline and two sets of cardiac enzymes negative for myocardial infarction. Pulmonary embolism is possible but no chest pain, tachycardia (on beta-blocker), or hemoptysis are present. The patient has chronic lower extremity edema, now possibly worsening, in the same leg as a hematoma. Thyroid dysfunction is unlikely to provoke acute decompensation. The patient's symptoms may have been worsening over the past week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/medication compliance in this patient with baseline dCHF that has been difficult to manage.

The patient is currently hypotensive on pressors and has been transferred from another hospital. She has severe tricuspid regurgitation and dilated right ventricle, which is consistent with right heart failure. The patient's renal function is deteriorating with a BUN of 100 and creatinine of 2.5 (baseline 1.7). This suggests decreased renal perfusion in the setting of decompensated heart failure and hypotension. The patient also has evidence of acute renal failure, with a recent admission for anemia thought to be related to recurrent lower gastrointestinal angioectasia bleeding. She has guaiac-positive stools but a stable hematocrit since last discharge. Most likely, this is another episode of lower gastrointestinal bleeding rather than upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, likely due to congestive hepatopathy.

The patient is also experiencing nausea, which may be related to uremia. There is no evidence of gastroenteritis currently; the abdomen is benign. The patient's ulcerative colitis does not seem to be in a flare, with no increase in diarrhea or abdominal cramping. Her diabetes is not currently being treated with hypoglycemics. Therefore, an insulin sliding scale will be used for glycemic control.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including worsening heart failure, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hepatic dysfunction. It is important to closely monitor her condition and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Patient with severe diastolic heart failure, severe
   TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She describes an acute onset which
   raises concern for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis but no fevers,
   cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic
   afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2
   sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or
   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Question component of reactive airways disease given earlier
   response to albuterol although no h/o COPD and no wheezes on exam
   currently.  Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.
   - lasix gtt and if not sufficient diuresis consider ultrafiltration
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - monitor I/O, daily weights
   - maintain levophed as necessary while diuresing
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Consider repeat TTE
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] notified of admission; he will stop by today; suggests
   possible need for ultrafiltration
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping; stable Hct suggests that this is more a slow
   bleed.  Pt with mild leukocytosis but no evidence of sepsis at this
   time. CVL placed. UA mildly inflammatory; culture pending.
   - Ciprofloxacin started [**4-1**] for empiric treatment of UTI
   - will maintain levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis and attempt to wean as possible
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC for now
   .
   # Hematochezia: Recent admission for anemia; thought to have recurrent
   lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with guaiac positive dark
   stools but stable Hct since last discharge.  Most c/w LGIB again rather
   than UGIB.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] notified
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 (baseline 1.7) Likely decreased
   renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart failure and
   hypotension. Did have ARF on last admission and was found to have urine
   eos on last admission and mesalamine initially held due to reports of
   AIN with this but restarted when stabilized; eventually thought more
   likely from prerenal azotemia.
   - FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%
   - Plan for diuresis as above
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] notified; asked for renal consult to see pt this AM, and
   he will follow while in house
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Diuresis as above
   .
   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.
   - Zofran prn
   - Monitor for now
   .
   # Afib: Stable with slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated
   secondary to GI bleeding
   - hold metoprolol for now in setting of hypotension  and pressor
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: Does not seem to be in a UC flare, no increase in
   diarrhea, no abdominal cramping
   - Continue asacol 800mg tid
   .
   # H/o DM: Not on hypoglycemics.
   - Insulin sliding scale for now
   # Restless legs.
   - start home gabapentin

   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient presents with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, which raises concern for an inciting event. 

The assessment and plan include addressing several medical complications:
1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient's severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation may contribute to her dyspnea and hypoxia. No clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia, and leukocytosis without fevers, cough, or clear consolidation rules out pneumonia as the cause. The patient is already on pressors, indicating hypotension. No signs of pulmonary embolism (PE) are present, and there is no evidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, but her rate is controlled. The presence of chronic lower extremity edema suggests a possible component of reactive airways disease, but this is not confirmed. Thyroid dysfunction is unlikely to provoke acute decompensation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely cardiogenic due to worsening diastolic CHF. She also has known colitis with guaiac-positive stools, indicating a slow bleed. A central venous line (CVL) has been placed, and urine culture"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of alcohol use disorder, presenting with multiple medical conditions including alcoholic hepatitis, renal failure, and respiratory failure. She was admitted to the ICU and started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to acute renal failure. The patient experienced hypotension and required the initiation of norepinephrine. She also had an episode of bradycardia initially but later stabilized. FiO2 was successfully weaned. The patient's fluid balance has been negative over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient experienced an episode of bradycardia, which can be caused by various factors such as medication side effects, electrolyte imbalances, or cardiac dysfunction. Monitoring the patient's heart rate and rhythm is crucial to prevent further episodes or complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to her underlying conditions. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has a history of alcoholic liver disease and currently has renal failure. Hepatorenal syndrome is a potential complication in this case, characterized by renal dysfunction in the setting of severe liver disease. Management includes supportive care and addressing the underlying liver disease.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Patient with severe diastolic heart failure, severe
   TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She describes an acute onset which
   raises concern for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis but no fevers,
   cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic
   afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2
   sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or
   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Question component of reactive airways disease given earlier
   response to albuterol although no h/o COPD and no wheezes on exam
   currently.  Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.
   - Repeat TTE unchanged from prior
   - Episode of chest pain on [**4-2**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin
   0.01->0.02
   - Ultrafiltration with careful monitoring of I/O and daily weight, with
   fluid goal -1L daily (careful to maintain pressures)
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - maintain levophed as necessary while diuresing
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) recs: ultrafiltration or chronic dialysis for
   volume mgt
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping; stable Hct suggests that this is more a slow
   bleed.  Pt with mild leukocytosis but no evidence of sepsis at this
   time. CVL placed. UA mildly inflammatory; repeat culture pending.
   - Ciprofloxacin started [**4-1**] for empiric treatment of UTI, empiric 7
   day course
   - will maintain levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis and attempt to wean as possible; goal MAP > 60
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC for now
   .
   # Hematochezia/ulcerative colitis: Recent admission for anemia; thought
   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.
   Hematochezia most c/w LGIB again rather than UGIB. As patient has no
   increase in diarrhea, no abdominal cramping, this does not seem to be a
   UC flare.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **] for now; transfuse for Hgb > 9 per renal recs
 will
   transfuse one unit today and get post transfusion hematocrit.
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue asacol 800mg tid
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] (GI) notified: agreed with continuing asacol; can call
   formal consult if needed.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 on admission (baseline 1.7)
   Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart
   failure and hypotension. Did have ARF on last admission and was found
   to have urine eos on last admission and mesalamine initially held due
   to reports of AIN with this but restarted when stabilized; eventually
   thought more likely from prerenal azotemia.
   - FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%. Repeat FeUN 23%.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] (Renal) notified and will follow while patient is in house
   - Renal recs: ultrafiltration, transfuse to keep Hgb > 9.0
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy.
   - Trend LFTs; resolving

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She presents with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, which raises concern for an inciting event. The patient is currently in the ICU, where she is being treated for multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient's severe TR (tricuspid regurgitation) and diastolic CHF can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, resulting in dyspnea and hypoxia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's worsening diastolic CHF and the use of pressors may contribute to hypotension. There is also a possibility of a slow bleed from ulcerative colitis contributing to the low blood pressure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Decreased renal perfusion due to decompensated heart failure and hypotension could be the cause.
4. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has mild elevations in AST and alkaline phosphatase levels, suggesting congestive hepatopathy due to right-sided heart failure.
5. Hematochezia/Ulcerative Colitis: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with severe diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and a recent lower gastrointestinal bleed. She presents with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, hypotension requiring pressors, and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is already being treated with pressors, but close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamics is necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.
2. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient's severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation may contribute to her symptoms. Oxygen therapy and diuresis should be continued, and further evaluation for any inciting events or underlying causes is needed.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level has increased, and she has an elevated BUN. Renal perfusion may be compromised due to decompensated heart failure and hypotension. Diuretics and fluid restriction should be continued, and close monitoring of renal function is essential.
4. Hematochezia/Ulcerative Colitis: The patient has a history of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently experiencing guaiac-positive stools. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and ongoing assessment for bleeding are necessary. Adjustments in medication therapy may be required.
5. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient has mild elevations in AST and alkaline"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure (ADHF): The patient has severe diastolic CHF and is experiencing dyspnea and hypoxia. ADHF can lead to poor cardiac output and hypotension, which may require pressor support.

2. Pulmonary Hypertension (PH): The patient has severe TR (tricuspid regurgitation) and pulmonary hypertension. PH can worsen right ventricular function and lead to further hemodynamic instability.

3. Ulcerative Colitis (UC): The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, which can cause chronic inflammation and ulceration of the colon. This can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated BUN and creatinine level, indicating decreased renal function. AKI can be caused by hypotension, decreased renal perfusion, and medication-related nephrotoxicity.

5. Hepatic Congestion: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, suggesting hepatic congestion due to right-sided heart failure. This can lead to hepatomegaly and potential liver dysfunction.

6. Lower Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding: The patient has guaiac-positive stools, indicating GI bleeding. The source of bleeding is likely from the lower GI tract, possibly related to angioectasias or other causes.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Patient with severe diastolic heart failure, severe
   TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She was 87.6kg on admission and up
   to 91kg during admission, up from dry weight of 140-145 lbs (65 kg).
   She describes an acute onset which raises concern for an inciting
   event. Pt w/ leukocytosis at presentation (now resolved) but no fevers,
   cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic
   afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2
   sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or
   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.
   - Repeat TTE unchanged from prior
   - Episode of chest pain on [**4-2**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin
   0.01->0.02
   - Ultrafiltration with careful monitoring of I/O and daily weight, with
   fluid goal -1 to -2 L daily (careful to maintain pressures)
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - Maintain levophed as necessary while diuresing
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) recs: ultrafiltration and/or chronic dialysis
   for volume mgt
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping; stable Hct suggests that this is more a slow
   bleed.  Pt with mild leukocytosis (resolved) but no evidence of sepsis.
   CVL placed. UA mildly inflammatory; repeat culture with GNRs >100K.
   - Ciprofloxacin started [**4-1**] for empiric treatment of UTI, empiric 7
   day course
   - Will maintain levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis and attempt to wean as possible; goal MAP > 60
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC for now
   .
   # Hematochezia/ulcerative colitis: Recent admission for anemia; thought
   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.
   Hematochezia most c/w LGIB again rather than UGIB. As patient has no
   increase in diarrhea, no abdominal cramping, this does not seem to be a
   UC flare.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **] for now; transfuse for Hgb > 9 per renal recs (received
   one unit on [**4-3**] without appropriate bump; will transfuse another unit
   today [**4-4**] and check post-transfusion Hct)
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue asacol 800mg tid
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] (GI) notified: agreed with continuing asacol; can call
   formal consult if needed.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 on admission (baseline 1.7)
   Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart
   failure and hypotension. Did have ARF on last admission and was found
   to have urine eos on last admission and mesalamine initially held due
   to reports of AIN with this but restarted when stabilized; eventually
   thought more likely from prerenal azotemia.
   - FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%. Repeat FeUN 23%.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] (Renal) notified and will follow while patient is in house
   - Renal recs: ultrafiltration, transfuse to keep Hgb > 9.0
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy.
   - Trend LFTs; resolving
   - Diuresis as above
   .
   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.
   - Zofran prn
   - Monitor for now
   .
   # Afib: Stable with slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated
   secondary to GI bleeding
   - Can restart metoprolol when pressures stabilized and off CVVH
   .
   # H/o DM: Not on hypoglycemics.
   - Insulin sliding scale
   # Restless legs.
   - continue home gabapentin
   # LLE fluctuant mass
 most likely hematoma, as documented in previous
   admission. Will watch for now.
   # Anxiety/depression
 SW felt pt
s readmission in setting of med
   non-compliance may be related to underlying anxiety/feelings of
   depression. Pt has not followed through on outpatient follow-up mental
   health visits in past.
   - Screen for depression and consider psych consult
   - Appreciate SW support.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation (afib), ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She presents with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, and is hypotensive on pressors. The patient has been admitted multiple times for anemia, thought to be caused by recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding. Her current symptoms include dyspnea, hypoxia, and hematochezia (bloody stools).

The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, with baseline creatinine levels of 1.7 rising to 2.5 on admission. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 100. She also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), with mild AST and alkaline phosphatase elevation. The patient is not anticoagulated due to GI bleeding, but her afib is stable with a slow ventricular response.

The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.7, hematocrit (Hct) of 23.0-24.5, platelet count of 212,000/mm^3, and blood glucose levels ranging from 99-153 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Plan:

The patient's current management plan includes ultrafiltration to manage fluid"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Patient with severe diastolic heart failure, severe
   TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She describes an acute onset which
   raises concern for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis but no fevers,
   cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic
   afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2
   sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or
   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Question component of reactive airways disease given earlier
   response to albuterol although no h/o COPD and no wheezes on exam
   currently.  Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.
   - Repeat TTE unchanged from prior
   - Episode of chest pain on [**4-2**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin
   0.01->0.02
   - Ultrafiltration with careful monitoring of I/O and daily weight, with
   fluid goal -1L daily (careful to maintain pressures)
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - maintain levophed as necessary while diuresing
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) recs: ultrafiltration or chronic dialysis for

   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping; stable Hct suggests that this is more a slow
   bleed.  Pt with mild leukocytosis but no evidence of sepsis at this
   time. CVL placed. UA mildly inflammatory; repeat culture pending.
   - Ciprofloxacin started [**4-1**] for empiric treatment of UTI, empiric 7
   day course
   - will maintain levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis and attempt to wean as possible; goal MAP > 60
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC for now

   # Hematochezia/ulcerative colitis: Recent admission for anemia; thought
   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation (afib), ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She presented with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, which raises concern for an inciting event. The patient has leukocytosis but no fever, cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia. She is in chronic afib but her heart rate is controlled. No chest pain or clear evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) is present. There is chronic lower extremity edema, now worse on one leg (same leg as hematoma). 

The patient's symptoms may have been worsening over the past week already, and there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/medication compliance in this patient with baseline dCHF that has been difficult to manage.

Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is unchanged from prior. She had an episode of chest pain on [**4-2**] that resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin 0.01 -> 0.02. 

The patient will undergo ultrafiltration with careful monitoring of intake/output (I/O) and daily weight, with fluid goal -1L daily (careful to maintain pressures). She will also receive [**Hospital1**] electrolytes, maintain levophed as necessary"

   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Patient with severe diastolic heart failure, severe
   TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She was 87.6kg on admission and up
   to 91kg during admission, up from dry weight of 140-145 lbs (65 kg).
   She describes an acute onset which raises concern for an inciting
   event. Pt w/ leukocytosis at presentation (now resolved) but no fevers,
   cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic
   afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2
   sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or
   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.  Repeat TTE unchanged from prior. Episode of chest pain on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and a recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She presented with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, which were initially thought to be related to an inciting event. However, no evidence of pneumonia or acute coronary syndrome was found. The patient also has chronic leg edema, a hematoma on her left shin, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient has been experiencing symptoms consistent with CHF exacerbation, including dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 114/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She is currently on levophed for pressor support and receiving aggressive diuresis.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, elevated BUN and creatinine levels, mild elevation in liver function tests (LFTs), and electrolyte imbalances. Her urine analysis indicates the presence of moderate leukocytes, blood, and traces of protein, with no evidence of infection or nitrites. Her urine culture is pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She presented with acute dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is most likely cardiogenic due to worsening diastolic CHF. She also has mild leukocytosis but no evidence of sepsis. A central venous line (CVL) has been placed.

The patient's dyspnea and hypoxia are likely due to severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She has gained weight during her admission, from 87.6 kg to 91 kg, exceeding her dry weight of 140-145 lbs (65 kg). The patient does not have signs of pneumonia or acute coronary syndrome. There is a possibility of pulmonary embolism, but no chest pain or hemoptysis is present. Thyroid dysfunction is unlikely to provoke acute decompensation. The patient's symptoms may have been worsening over the past week, and there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med compliance.

The patient has a history of chronic left lower extremity edema, now worse on the same leg as a pre-existing hematoma. An episode of chest pain on [date] has resolved, and the troponin level increased slightly. The patient will undergo ultrafiltration with"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient presents with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, hypotension requiring pressor support, and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's symptoms include mild leukocytosis, which has resolved, no evidence of sepsis, and an inflammatory urine analysis with gram-negative rods (GNRs) >100K. The patient has been started on ciprofloxacin for empiric treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI), and the culture results are pending.

The patient's dyspnea and hypoxia are attributed to severe diastolic CHF and tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The patient's weight has increased from 87.6 kg on admission to 91 kg during the admission, above her dry weight of 140-145 lbs (65 kg). There is no evidence of pneumonia, and the patient's chest pain has resolved with unchanged EKG and troponin levels.

The patient's hematochezia is consistent with lower GI bleed, possibly from recurrent angioectasia bleeding. The patient has guaiac-positive stools but a stable hematocrit (Hct) since the last discharge. There is no evidence of an acute ulcerative colitis"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   . .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping; stable Hct suggests that this is more a slow
   bleed.  Pt with mild leukocytosis (resolved) but no evidence of sepsis.
   CVL placed. UA mildly inflammatory; repeat culture with GNRs >100K.
   - Ciprofloxacin started [**4-1**] for empiric treatment of UTI, empiric 7
   day course
   - Will maintain levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis and attempt to wean as possible; goal MAP > 60
   - Monitor temp curve, WBC for now
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Patient with severe diastolic heart failure, severe
   TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She was 87.6kg on admission and up
   to 91kg during admission, up from dry weight of 140-145 lbs (65 kg).
   She describes an acute onset which raises concern for an inciting
   event. Pt w/ leukocytosis at presentation (now resolved) but no fevers,
   cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic
   afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2
   sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or
   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.  Repeat TTE unchanged from prior.
   - Episode of chest pain on [**4-2**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin
   0.01->0.02
   - Ultrafiltration with careful monitoring of I/O and daily weight ([**4-4**]
   was 85kg), with fluid goal -3 L daily (careful to maintain pressures)
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - Maintain levophed as necessary while diuresing (weaned off on [**4-4**])
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able

   .
   # Hematochezia/ulcerative colitis: Recent admission for anemia; thought
   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.
   Hematochezia most c/w LGIB again rather than UGIB. As patient has no
   increase in diarrhea, no abdominal cramping, this does not seem to be a
   UC flare.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct [**Hospital1 **] for now; transfuse for Hgb > 9 per renal recs (received
   one unit on [**4-3**] without appropriate bump; will transfuse another unit
   today [**4-4**] and check post-transfusion Hct)
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue asacol 800mg tid
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] (GI) notified: agreed with continuing asacol; can call
   formal consult if needed.
   - Pt with diarrhea since starting ciprofloxacin, likely related to
   antibiotic rather than acute UC flare. Will follow; check C. Diff if
   continues.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 on admission (baseline 1.7)
   Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart
   failure and hypotension. Did have ARF on last admission and was found
   to have urine eos on last admission and mesalamine initially held due
   to reports of AIN with this but restarted when stabilized; eventually
   thought more likely from prerenal azotemia.
   - FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%. Repeat FeUN 23%.

The patient presents with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, which are likely related to her severe diastolic CHF and worsening cardiac output. The patient also has mild leukocytosis but no evidence of sepsis.

The patient's current medications include home peroral proton pump inhibitor (PPI), asacol 800mg tid, and gabapentin. She is currently receiving levophed for pressor support, ultrafiltration with careful monitoring of intake/output and daily weight, and nebulizers as needed. The patient's electrolytes are being carefully monitored, and she is on insulin sliding scale for diabetes management.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. Her FeUN has improved from 31% to 23%. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are mildly elevated, suggesting congestive hepatopathy. Her hemoglobin (Hgb) level is stable, and she received one unit of blood transfusion without an appropriate Hct bump.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, renal failure, and fluid overload. She experienced one episode of blood loss, but her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) remained stable. The patient has allergies to lisinopril, cefazolin sodium, and sulfonamide antibiotics. She also has a known adverse reaction to shellfish.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate (HR) between 62-84 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 65/40 mmHg to 129/76 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) between 8-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 82.1 kg, and her central venous pressure (CVP) is within the normal range. Fluid intake and output have been recorded, showing a total input of 8,120 mL and total output of 12,647 mL. Urine output has been 735 mL.

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 109 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 27%, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 44 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) of -3 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, crackles in the left lung base, diminished breath sounds on the right side, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding appropriately.

Laboratory tests show a white blood cell (WBC) count between 4.4 and 5.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) level between 9.0 g/dL and 29.8%, platelet (Plt) count between 119 and 148 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level between 1.0 and 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose between 125 and 148 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to fluid overload and ongoing losses.
2. Ventricular arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to chronic heart failure and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Pulmonary edema or respiratory failure due to left-sided heart failure.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and risk factors.
5. Infection or sepsis due to immunocompromised state and indwelling lines/catheters.
6. Bleeding or hemorrhage due to anticoagulant therapy and renal failure."

   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].

   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping.  Pt with mild leukocytosis (resolved) but no
   evidence of sepsis. CVL placed.
   - Will use levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis as needed and attempt to wean as possible; goal MAP > 60 (not
   needed overnight [**4-5**])
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia/volume overload: Patient with severe diastolic heart
   failure, severe TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She was 87.6kg on
   admission and up to 91kg during admission, up from dry weight of
   140-145 lbs (65 kg). She describes an acute onset which raises concern
   for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis at presentation (now
   resolved) but no fevers, cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of
   pneumonia.  Pt in chronic afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest
   ACS; EKG baseline and 2 sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia
   (on beta blocker), or hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now
   ?L>R (same leg as hematoma). Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke
   acute decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over
   the past week already; there may be a component of suboptimal
   dietary/med compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very
   difficult to manage.  Repeat TTE unchanged from prior. Episode of chest
   pain on [**4-2**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin 0.01->0.02
   - Ultrafiltration with careful monitoring of I/O and daily weight ([**4-4**]
   - 85kg, [**4-5**]
 81kg, [**4-6**]
 78kg), with fluid goal -4 L or more as
   tolerated daily
   - [**Month (only) 60**] transition to HD by Monday per renal
   - Electrolytes with CVVH
   - Levophed as necessary while diuresing
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able

   # Hematochezia/ulcerative colitis: Recent admission for anemia; thought
   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.
   Hematochezia most c/w LGIB again rather than UGIB. As patient has no no
   abdominal cramping, this does not seem to be a UC flare. Pt with [**Doctor Last Name **]
   antibody. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] (GI) notified: agreed with continuing asacol; can
   call formal consult if needed.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct daily; transfuse for Hgb > 8 (received one unit on [**4-3**] and
   another on [**4-4**] with appropriate bump)
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Pt refusing asacol 800mg tid (says she vomits with this pill)
 has
   now missed two doses. Emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] to make aware; will make
   formal GI consult today if pt continues to refuse medication to find
   alternate regimen for UC
   - Pt with diarrhea since starting ciprofloxacin, likely related to
   antibiotic rather than acute UC flare. Improving; C. Diff is negative
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 on admission (baseline 1.7)
   Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart
   failure and hypotension. Improving on CVVH. FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%.
   Repeat FeUN 23%.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] (Renal) notified and will follow while patient is in house
   - Renal recs: ultrafiltration, transfuse to keep Hgb > 8.0
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy. Resolving
   - Diuresis as above

   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.

   # H/o DM: Not on hypoglycemics.
   - Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Pain/difficulty sleeping. Pt reports diffuse pain in legs, arms,
everywhere but my stomach
. Possible component of anxiety.
   - continue home gabapentin; bengay also ordered
   - Continue pt

   - Pt received trazodone [**4-4**] and [**4-5**] overnight
   - SW following pt; appreciate SW support. SW felt pt
s readmission in
   setting of possible med non-compliance may be related to underlying
   anxiety/feelings of sadness. Pt has not followed through on outpatient
   follow-up mental health visits in past.  Pt not currently interested in
   further psych/therapy eval; denies depression, expresses hope
   .
   # UTI: Ciprofloxacin [**2014-3-31**] for empiric treatment of UTI, empiric 3
   day course given no Foley on admission but has Foley now. Repeat UA on
   [**4-5**] still with bacteria; culture pending.
   - Follow-up culture results and if positive
 extend course ABX

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleed. She was admitted with acute dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension. 

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires pressor support. Levophed will be used for pressor support during aggressive diuresis as needed, with the goal of maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.

2. Dyspnea/Hypoxia/volume overload: The patient has severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation. She experienced an acute onset of symptoms, which raises concern for an inciting event. The patient has leukocytosis at presentation but no signs of pneumonia. She is in chronic atrial fibrillation but rate-controlled. No coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome is evident. The patient has chronic lower extremity edema, now possibly worse on the right leg (same leg as a hematoma). Thyroid dysfunction is unlikely to provoke acute decompensation.

   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.  Repeat TTE unchanged from prior. Episode of chest pain on

   - Pt refusing asacol 800mg tid (says she vomits with this pill)
 has
   now missed two doses. Emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] to make aware; will make
   formal GI consult today if pt continues to refuse medication to find
   alternate regimen for UC
   - Pt with diarrhea since starting ciprofloxacin, likely related to
   antibiotic rather than acute UC flare. Improving; C. Diff is negative
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 on admission (baseline 1.7)
   Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart
   failure and hypotension. Improving on CVVH. FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%.
   Repeat FeUN 23%.

   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient presents with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, which are likely related to her severe diastolic CHF and severe tricuspid regurgitation.

The patient is currently on pressors and being treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to acute renal failure. She also has electrolyte imbalances, including hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Her liver function tests show mild elevations, which may be indicative of congestive hepatopathy.

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding, but her current symptoms do not suggest an active flare-up. She is currently being managed with medication for her conditions, including diuretics, a proton pump inhibitor, and asacol for ulcerative colitis. However, she has been refusing to take asacol 800mg tid due to vomiting, and her healthcare team is considering alternative medication options.

The patient's pain and difficulty sleeping may be attributed to anxiety or underlying sadness, as suggested by the social worker. She has not followed through on outpatient mental health visits in the past and is not currently interested in further psychological evaluation. However, she expresses hope for improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleed. She presented with acute dyspnea, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient has been on multiple medications including levophed for pressor support, spironolactone, torsemide, metolazone, and nebulizers as needed. She is also undergoing ultrafiltration, CVVH for renal support, and careful monitoring of electrolytes. The patient has a history of hematochezia due to lower gastrointestinal bleed and is currently on asacol. She also has elevated liver function tests, which are likely due to congestive hepatopathy. The patient is not on hypoglycemics for her diabetes and is being managed with insulin sliding scale. She reports diffuse pain and difficulty sleeping, which may be related to anxiety. The patient has a fluctuant mass on her left shin, most likely a hematoma. She also has an ear pain, which will be evaluated further if persistent. The patient's code status is full, and her disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with severe diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She presents with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, hypotension requiring pressor support, and mild leukocytosis. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, nausea, atrial fibrillation, and a fluctuant mass in the lower extremity.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with an increase in BUN and creatinine levels. She is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to manage her renal failure. The patient also has elevated liver function tests, likely due to congestive hepatopathy secondary to heart failure.

The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms include hematochezia, which is likely lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and diarrhea since starting ciprofloxacin. She has a history of ulcerative colitis and was recently admitted for anemia due to recurrent lower gastrointestinal angioectasia bleeding.

The patient's cardiac status is complicated by severe diastolic congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation. She has been on pressor support with levophed and is being aggressively diuresed to manage her fluid status.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, involving multiple organ systems. She requires careful monitoring and management of her heart failure, renal function,"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping.  Pt with mild leukocytosis (resolved) but no
   evidence of sepsis. CVL placed.
   - Will use levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis as needed and attempt to wean as possible; goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Patient with severe diastolic heart failure, severe
   TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She was 87.6kg on admission and up
   to 91kg during admission, up from dry weight of 140-145 lbs (65 kg).
   She describes an acute onset which raises concern for an inciting
   event. Pt w/ leukocytosis at presentation (now resolved) but no fevers,
   cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of pneumonia.  Pt in chronic
   afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest ACS; EKG baseline and 2
   sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia (on beta blocker), or
   hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now ?L>R (same leg as
   hematoma). Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke acute
   decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over the past
   week already; there may be a component of suboptimal dietary/med
   compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very difficult
   to manage.  Repeat TTE unchanged from prior. Episode of chest pain on
   [**4-2**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin 0.01->0.02
   - Ultrafiltration with careful monitoring of I/O and daily weight ([**4-4**]
   - 85kg, [**4-5**]
 81kg), with fluid goal -3 to -4 L daily
   - Electrolytes with CVVH
   - Levophed as necessary while diuresing
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) recs: ultrafiltration and/or chronic dialysis
   for volume mgt
   .
   # Hematochezia/ulcerative colitis: Recent admission for anemia; thought
   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.
   Hematochezia most c/w LGIB again rather than UGIB. As patient has no no
   abdominal cramping, this does not seem to be a UC flare. Pt with [**Doctor Last Name **]
   antibody.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct daily; transfuse for Hgb > 9 per renal recs (received one
   unit on [**4-3**] and another on [**4-4**] with appropriate bump)
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue asacol 800mg tid
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] (GI) notified: agreed with continuing asacol; can call
   formal consult if needed.
   - Pt with diarrhea since starting ciprofloxacin, likely related to
   antibiotic rather than acute UC flare. Will follow; C. Diff is negative
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 on admission (baseline 1.7)
   Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart
   failure and hypotension. Improving on CVVH. FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%.
   Repeat FeUN 23%.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] (Renal) notified and will follow while patient is in house
   - Renal recs: ultrafiltration, transfuse to keep Hgb > 9.0
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy. Resolving
   - Diuresis as above
   .
   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.
   - Zofran prn
   .
   # Afib: Stable with slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated
   secondary to GI bleeding
   - Can restart metoprolol when pressures stabilized and off CVVH
   .
   # H/o DM: Not on hypoglycemics.
   - Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Pain/difficulty sleeping. Pt reports diffuse pain in legs, arms,
everywhere but my stomach
. Possible component of anxiety.
   - continue home gabapentin; bengay also ordered
   - Continue pt
s oxycodone prn
   - SW following pt; appreciate SW support. SW felt pt
s readmission in
   setting of possible med non-compliance may be related to underlying
   anxiety/feelings of sadness. Pt has not followed through on outpatient
   follow-up mental health visits in past.  Pt not currently interested in
   further psych/therapy eval; denies depression, expresses hope
   .
   # UTI: Ciprofloxacin [**2014-3-31**] for empiric treatment of UTI, empiric 3
   day course given no Foley on admission but has Foley now. Repeat UA on
   [**4-5**] still with bacteria; culture pending.
   - Follow-up culture results if positive
 extend course ABX
   .
   # LLE fluctuant mass
 most likely hematoma, as documented in previous
   admission. Will watch for now.
   .
   # Ear pain. PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3879**]; if persists during this admission will
   obtain otoscope and examine for wax.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient presented with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, which are likely due to worsening diastolic CHF. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension that is most likely cardiogenic in nature. The patient requires aggressive diuresis with careful monitoring of intravenous (IV) fluids and daily weight. Levophed may be used as a pressor support if needed. 

The patient also has dyspnea/hypoxia due to severe diastolic heart failure and tricuspid regurgitation. She has chronic atrial fibrillation but is rate-controlled. There are no signs of pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or acute coronary syndrome. 

The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis with recent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been experiencing hematochezia but is stable with a hematocrit level that has not significantly changed since discharge. 

The patient's renal function has worsened since admission, with a baseline creatinine level of 1.7 and current levels of 2.5. She is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with improving renal function. 

The patient also has elevated liver enzymes, likely due to congestive hepatopathy. Her"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-inch tall individual with a current weight of 73.6 kg, showing a weight loss of 14 kg since admission. The patient is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration) and will be transitioning to hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow. The patient has allergies to lisinopril, resulting in abdominal rash and hives; to cefazolin sodium, causing hives; and to sulfa, leading to hives, nausea, and facial swelling. The patient also has an allergy to shellfish.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature range of 35.6-36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 76-99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74/43-124/77 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has atrial fibrillation as their heart rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 7,243 mL and output of 12,441 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of 5,198 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery without any mechanical ventilation. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 42 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 102 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 29 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -2 mEq/L, and oxygen content (O2 content) of 29 vol%.

Physical examination findings are not provided in the given progress note. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin concentration (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Kidney function tests such as creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are within normal limits. Liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), are also within normal range. Electrolyte levels, including sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO43-) are within normal limits. Glucose levels are within normal range as well. Other lab results, including PT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, differential white blood cell count, lactic acid, albumin, LDH, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, are also provided.

The patient's assessment includes ongoing ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, multiple lines (arterial, multi-lumen, and dialysis catheter), prophylaxis"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping.  Pt with mild leukocytosis (resolved) but no
   evidence of sepsis. CVL placed.
   - Will use levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis as needed and attempt to wean as possible; goal MAP > 60 (not
   needed overnight [**4-5**])
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia/volume overload: Patient with severe diastolic heart
   failure, severe TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She was 87.6kg on
   admission and up to 91kg during admission, up from dry weight of
   140-145 lbs (65 kg). She describes an acute onset which raises concern
   for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis at presentation (now
   resolved) but no fevers, cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of
   pneumonia.  Pt in chronic afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest
   ACS; EKG baseline and 2 sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia
   (on beta blocker), or hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now
   ?L>R (same leg as hematoma). Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke
   acute decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over
   the past week already; there may be a component of suboptimal
   dietary/med compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very
   difficult to manage.  Repeat TTE unchanged from prior. Episode of chest
   pain on [**4-2**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin 0.01->0.02
   - Ultrafiltration with careful monitoring of I/O and daily weight ([**4-4**]
   - 85kg, [**4-5**]
 81kg, [**4-6**]
 78kg), with fluid goal -4 L or more as
   tolerated daily
   - [**Month (only) 60**] transition to HD by Monday per renal
   - Electrolytes with CVVH
   - Levophed as necessary while diuresing
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) recs: ultrafiltration and/or chronic dialysis
   for volume mgt
   .
   # Hematochezia/ulcerative colitis: Recent admission for anemia; thought
   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.
   Hematochezia most c/w LGIB again rather than UGIB. As patient has no no
   abdominal cramping, this does not seem to be a UC flare. Pt with [**Doctor Last Name **]
   antibody. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] (GI) notified: agreed with continuing asacol; can
   call formal consult if needed.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct daily; transfuse for Hgb > 8 (received one unit on [**4-3**] and
   another on [**4-4**] with appropriate bump)
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Pt refusing asacol 800mg tid (says she vomits with this pill)
 has
   now missed two doses. Emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] to make aware; will make
   formal GI consult today if pt continues to refuse medication to find
   alternate regimen for UC
   - Pt with diarrhea since starting ciprofloxacin, likely related to
   antibiotic rather than acute UC flare. Improving; C. Diff is negative
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 on admission (baseline 1.7)
   Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart
   failure and hypotension. Improving on CVVH. FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%.
   Repeat FeUN 23%.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] (Renal) notified and will follow while patient is in house
   - Renal recs: ultrafiltration, transfuse to keep Hgb > 8.0
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   # Elevated serum calcium: Secondary to calcium binding agents
 ionized
   calcium actually slightly low.
   - Will follow renal recs for best monitoring, maintenance of
   appropriate levels
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy. Resolving
   - Diuresis as above
   .
   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.
   - Zofran prn
   .
   # Afib: Stable with slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated
   secondary to GI bleeding
   - Can restart metoprolol when pressures stabilized and off CVVH
   .
   # H/o DM: Not on hypoglycemics.
   - Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Pain/difficulty sleeping. Pt reports diffuse pain in legs, arms,
everywhere but my stomach
. Possible component of anxiety.
   - continue home gabapentin; bengay also ordered
   - Continue pt
s oxycodone prn
   - Pt received trazodone [**4-4**] and [**4-5**] overnight
   - SW following pt; appreciate SW support. SW felt pt
s readmission in
   setting of possible med non-compliance may be related to underlying
   anxiety/feelings of sadness. Pt has not followed through on outpatient
   follow-up mental health visits in past.  Pt not currently interested in
   further psych/therapy eval; denies depression, expresses hope
   .
   # UTI: Ciprofloxacin [**2014-3-31**] for empiric treatment of UTI, empiric 3
   day course given no Foley on admission but has Foley now. Repeat UA on
   [**4-5**] still with bacteria; culture pending.
   - Follow-up culture results and if positive
 extend course ABX
   .
   # LLE fluctuant mass
 most likely hematoma, as documented in previous
   admission. Will watch for now.
   .
   # Ear pain. PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3879**]; if persists during this admission will
   obtain otoscope and examine for wax.

She was admitted with acute dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to acute renal failure. She also has a fluctuant mass on her left lower extremity, likely a hematoma. The patient's conditions include hypotension, dyspnea/hypoxia/volume overload, hematochezia/ulcerative colitis, elevated serum calcium, elevated liver function tests, nausea, atrial fibrillation, and pain/difficulty sleeping.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to worsening diastolic congestive heart failure.
2. Respiratory failure due to severe pulmonary hypertension and acute dyspnea.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding from recurrent lower gastrointestinal angioectasia or ulcerative colitis.
4. Renal failure due to decreased renal perfusion in the setting of decompensated heart failure and hypotension.
5. Hypercalcemia secondary to calcium binding agents.
6. Hepatic congestion and hepatopathy due to right-sided heart failure.
7. Uremic symptoms such as nausea and potential confusion.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged"

   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping.  Pt with mild leukocytosis (resolved) but no
   evidence of sepsis. CVL placed.
   - Will use levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis as needed and attempt to wean as possible; goal MAP > 60 (not
   needed overnight [**4-5**])
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia/volume overload: Patient with severe diastolic heart
   failure, severe TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She was 87.6kg on
   admission and up to 91kg during admission, up from dry weight of
   140-145 lbs (65 kg). She describes an acute onset which raises concern
   for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis at presentation (now
   resolved) but no fevers, cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of
   pneumonia.  Pt in chronic afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest
   ACS; EKG baseline and 2 sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia
   (on beta blocker), or hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now
   ?L>R (same leg as hematoma). Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke
   acute decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over
   the past week already; there may be a component of suboptimal
   dietary/med compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very
   difficult to manage.  Repeat TTE unchanged from prior. Episode of chest
   pain on [**4-2**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin 0.01->0.02
   - Ultrafiltration with careful monitoring of I/O and daily weight ([**4-4**]
   - 85kg, [**4-5**]
 81kg, [**4-6**]
 78kg), with fluid goal -4 L or more as
   tolerated daily
   - [**Month (only) 60**] transition to HD by Monday per renal
   - Electrolytes with CVVH
   - Levophed as necessary while diuresing
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) recs: ultrafiltration and/or chronic dialysis
   for volume mgt
   .
   # Hematochezia/ulcerative colitis: Recent admission for anemia; thought
   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.
   Hematochezia most c/w LGIB again rather than UGIB. As patient has no no
   abdominal cramping, this does not seem to be a UC flare. Pt with [**Doctor Last Name **]
   antibody. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] (GI) notified: agreed with continuing asacol; can
   call formal consult if needed.
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct daily; transfuse for Hgb > 8 (received one unit on [**4-3**] and
   another on [**4-4**] with appropriate bump)
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Pt refusing asacol 800mg tid (says she vomits with this pill)
 has
   now missed two doses. Emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] to make aware; will make
   formal GI consult today if pt continues to refuse medication to find
   alternate regimen for UC
   - Pt with diarrhea since starting ciprofloxacin, likely related to
   antibiotic rather than acute UC flare. Improving; C. Diff is negative
   .
   # Acute renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 on admission (baseline 1.7)
   Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of decompensated heart
   failure and hypotension. Improving on CVVH. FeNA = 5.8%, FeUN = 31%.
   Repeat FeUN 23%.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] (Renal) notified and will follow while patient is in house
   - Renal recs: ultrafiltration, transfuse to keep Hgb > 8.0
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   # Elevated serum calcium: Secondary to calcium binding agents
 ionized
   calcium actually slightly low.
   - Will follow renal recs for best monitoring, maintenance of
   appropriate levels
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy. Resolving
   - Diuresis as above
   .
   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.
   - Zofran prn
   .
   # Afib: Stable with slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated
   secondary to GI bleeding
   - Can restart metoprolol when pressures stabilized and off CVVH
   .
   # H/o DM: Not on hypoglycemics.
   - Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Pain/difficulty sleeping. Pt reports diffuse pain in legs, arms,
everywhere but my stomach
. Possible component of anxiety.
   - continue home gabapentin; bengay also ordered
   - Continue pt
s oxycodone prn
   - Pt received trazodone [**4-4**] and [**4-5**] overnight
   - SW following pt; appreciate SW support. SW felt pt
s readmission in
   setting of possible med non-compliance may be related to underlying
   anxiety/feelings of sadness. Pt has not followed through on outpatient
   follow-up mental health visits in past.  Pt not currently interested in
   further psych/therapy eval; denies depression, expresses hope
   .
   # UTI: Ciprofloxacin [**2014-3-31**] for empiric treatment of UTI, empiric 3
   day course given no Foley on admission but has Foley now. Repeat UA on
   [**4-5**] still with bacteria; culture pending.
   - Follow-up culture results and if positive
 extend course ABX
   .
   # LLE fluctuant mass
 most likely hematoma, as documented in previous
   admission. Will watch for now.
   .
   # Ear pain. PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3879**]; if persists during this admission will
   obtain otoscope and examine for wax.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and hypertension. The patient has been receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and is currently on CVVH. The patient complains of bilateral ear pain, but the examination shows normal tympanic membranes and external auditory canals. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 76-99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80-124 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on AFib rhythm with II/VI SEM at RLSB. Physical examination reveals mild dryness of lips, decreased breath sounds at the bases, minimal crackles at the bases, soft non-tender non-distended abdomen, and 3+ pitting edema in both lower extremities. The patient also has a fluctuant hematoma on the left shin. Laboratory results show some fluctuations in WBC, Hct, Cr, TCO2, glucose levels, and other lab parameters. The patient's plan includes transitioning to hemodialysis tomorrow, maintaining glycemic control, and providing prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, electrolyte imbalances, infection (e.g., VAP),"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleed. She was admitted with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, hypotensive on pressors, and transferred from another hospital.

The patient has been experiencing ongoing hypotension, likely due to worsening diastolic CHF. She also has hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.7 at 2 AM today. The plan is for hemodialysis (HD) today to manage her electrolytes and fluid overload. The patient's dyspnea and hypoxia are attributed to severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation.

The patient has a history of hematochezia related to ulcerative colitis, but currently, she has guaiac-positive dark stools without evidence of an acute flare-up. She is refusing to take Asacol, a medication for ulcerative colitis, due to vomiting with the pill. Active tissue and stool surveillance are ongoing.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine of 1.7 and BUN of 100 on admission. Her renal function is improving on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and she will transition to HD tomorrow. Renal recommendations include discontinuing CVVH, planning for HD, and maintaining appropriate electrolyte levels.

The patient also has elevated serum calcium levels, likely secondary to calcium binding agents, and hyponatremia, which is likely due to renal failure and intravascular relative hypovolemia. She has mild elevations in liver function tests (LFTs), which are likely due to congestive hepatopathy.

The patient's nausea is likely related to uremia, and she has been prescribed Zofran as needed. She has a history of atrial fibrillation but is not anticoagulated secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding. She has difficulty sleeping and reports diffuse pain in her legs, arms, and everywhere except her stomach, which may be related to anxiety. She is currently taking gabapentin and oxycodone as needed.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) for which she was given ciprofloxacin, but her repeat urine culture showed 10-100K E. Coli, so she will restart ciprofloxacin for a 7-day course beginning today.

The patient has a fluctuant mass on her left lower extremity, which is most likely a hematoma. There are no immediate plans to intervene, but it will be monitored.

Lastly, the patient has ear pain, and her examination showed pristine external auditory canal and tympanic membranes without cerumen."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping.  Pt with mild leukocytosis (resolved) but no
   evidence of sepsis. CVL placed.
   - Will use levophed for pressor support in setting of aggressive
   diuresis as needed and attempt to wean as possible; goal MAP > 60 (most
   recently used [**4-5**] at 3am)
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. K 5.7 at 2am today [**4-8**]. EKG without peaked K waves or
   widened QRS.
   - Plan for HD today
   - Recheck K at 12pm today if not yet undergoing HD, and recheck EKG if
   still elevated.
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia/volume overload: Patient with severe diastolic heart
   failure, severe TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. She was 87.6kg on
   admission and up to 91kg during admission, up from dry weight of
   140-145 lbs (65 kg). She describes an acute onset which raises concern
   for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis at presentation (now
   resolved) but no fevers, cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of
   pneumonia.  Pt in chronic afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest
   ACS; EKG baseline and 2 sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia
   (on beta blocker), or hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now
   ?L>R (same leg as hematoma). Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke
   acute decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over
   the past week already; there may be a component of suboptimal
   dietary/med compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very
   difficult to manage.  Repeat TTE unchanged from prior. Episode of chest
   pain on [**4-2**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin 0.01->0.02
   - CVVH discontinued on [**4-7**], with plan to transition to HD [**4-8**].
   Careful monitoring of I/O and daily weight ([**4-4**] - 85kg, [**4-5**]
 81kg,
   [**4-6**]
 78kg, [**4-8**] - )
   - Electrolytes qday and with HD
   - Levophed as necessary while on CVVH to maintain pressures
   - Will transition back to home spironolactone, torsemide, and
   metolazone as able (obtain renal recs for doses while on HD)
   - Nebulizers prn
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) recs: ultrafiltration and/or chronic dialysis
   for volume mgt
   .
   # Hematochezia/ulcerative colitis: Recent admission for anemia; thought
   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.
   Hematochezia most c/w LGIB again rather than UGIB. As patient has no no
   abdominal cramping, this does not seem to be a UC flare. Pt with [**Doctor Last Name **]
   antibody. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] (GI) notified: agreed with continuing asacol; can
   call formal consult if needed. Pt with diarrhea for several days while
   on ciprofloxacin, likely related to antibiotic rather than acute UC
   flare; now resolved; C. Diff is negative
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct daily; transfuse for Hgb > 8 (received one unit on [**4-3**] and
   another on [**4-4**] with appropriate bump)
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Pt refusing asacol 800mg tid (says she vomits with this pill)
 has
   now missed several doses. Emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] to make aware; will make
   formal GI consult if pt becomes symptomatic and continues to refuse
   medication
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 on admission
   (baseline 1.7) Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of
   decompensated heart failure and hypotension. Improving on CVVH. FeNA =
   5.8%, FeUN = 31%. Repeat FeUN 23%.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] (Renal) notified and will follow while patient is in house
   - Renal recs: CVVH discontinued [**4-7**] with plan for HD [**4-8**], transfuse
   to keep Hgb > 8.0
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   # Elevated serum calcium: Secondary to calcium binding agents
 ionized
   calcium actually slightly low.
   - Will follow renal recs for best monitoring, maintenance of
   appropriate levels
   .
   # Hyponatremia. Na 132 on [**4-8**] now that off CVVH.  K elevated. Likely
   due to renal failure and intravascular relative hypovolemia (supported
   by recent episodes of hypotension) with appropriate ADH secretion
   despite total body hypervolemia.
   - Plan for dialysis today
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and Tbili. No
   abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy. Resolving
   - Diuresis as above
   .
   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.
   - Zofran prn
   .
   # Afib: Stable with slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated
   secondary to GI bleeding
   - Can restart metoprolol when pressures stabilized and off CVVH
   .
   # H/o DM: Not on hypoglycemics.
   - Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Pain/difficulty sleeping. Pt reports diffuse pain in legs, arms,
everywhere but my stomach
. Possible component of anxiety.
   - continue home gabapentin; bengay also ordered
   - Continue pt
s oxycodone prn
   - Pt received trazodone [**4-4**] and [**4-5**] overnight
   - SW following pt; appreciate SW support. SW felt pt
s readmission in
   setting of possible med non-compliance may be related to underlying
   anxiety/feelings of sadness. Pt has not followed through on outpatient
   follow-up mental health visits in past.  Pt not currently interested in
   further psych/therapy eval; denies depression, expresses hope
   .
   # UTI: Ciprofloxacin [**2014-3-31**] for empiric treatment of UTI, empiric 3
   day course given no Foley on admission but has Foley now. Repeat UA on
   [**4-5**] still with bacteria; culture with 10-100K E. Coli (foley in
   place).
   - Restart ciprofloxacin for 7 day course beginning [**4-8**]
   .
   # LLE fluctuant mass
 most likely hematoma, as documented in previous
   admission. Will watch for now.
   .
   # Ear pain. PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3879**]; examination with otoscope showed pristine EC
   and tympanic membranes without cerumen.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, ulcerative colitis, and recent lower gastrointestinal bleed. She presented with acute dyspnea and hypoxia, and was found to have mild leukocytosis but no evidence of sepsis. The patient is currently hypotensive and requires pressor support. She also has hyperkalemia, dyspnea/hypoxia/volume overload, hematochezia/ulcerative colitis, acute on chronic renal failure, elevated serum calcium, hyponatremia, elevated liver function tests, nausea, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, pain/difficulty sleeping, and a urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to worsening diastolic CHF and may lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and decreased organ perfusion.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium level needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias.

3. Dyspnea/Hypoxia/Volume Overload: The patient's severe diastolic heart failure and severe tricuspid regurgitation contribute to her symptoms of dyspnea, hypoxia, and volume overload. If not properly managed, these symptoms may worsen, leading to respiratory distress and"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with chronic renal failure and acute on chronic heart failure. She has a history of allergies to Lisinopril, Kefzol (Cefazolin Sodium), and Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics). She also has shellfish-derived food allergies. 

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/51 mmHg to 125/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has significant edema in both lower extremities and is currently receiving dialysis. Her recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her creatinine levels are increasing over time, indicating worsening renal function. Other lab results are relatively stable.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU for massive volume overload, acute on chronic renal failure, and acute on chronic heart failure. She is expected to undergo regular hemodialysis. Her current medical issues include acute renal failure, diastolic heart failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening heart failure symptoms, infection due to immunosuppression or indwelling lines, and complications related to dialysis."

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with severe diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, afib, ulcerative
   colitis, and recent lower GI bleed p/w acute dyspnea and hypoxia,
   hypotensive on pressors who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely cardiogenic in setting of worsening dCHF. Pt
   does have known colitis with guaiac positive stools and planned for
   outpatient scoping.  Pt with mild leukocytosis (resolved) but no
   evidence of sepsis. CVL placed.
   - On levophed briefly on [**4-8**] afternoon during HD. Goal MAP > 60. Will
   discontinue as patient transitions to floor and use less aggressive
   volume dialysis goals to avoid hypotension requiring pressors.
   .
   # Volume overload: Pt 87.6kg on admission and up to 91kg during
   admission, up from dry weight of 140-145 lbs (65 kg).
   - CVVH discontinued on [**4-7**], with plan to transition to HD [**4-8**].
   Careful monitoring of I/O and daily weight ([**4-4**] - 85kg, [**4-5**]
 81kg,
   [**4-6**]
 78kg, [**4-8**]
 standing weight 69.5kg)
   - Electrolytes qday and with HD
   - renal recs: plan for HD [**4-9**] and possibly [**4-10**]
   - Ultimate plan for volume overload unclear presently as renal team
   recommends permanent HD but pt not entirely willing and has history of
   non-compliance. Will follow renal recs; may transition back to home
   spironolactone, torsemide, and metolazone as able (obtain renal recs
   for doses while on HD)
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (cardiology) recs: ultrafiltration and/or chronic dialysis
   for volume mgt
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. Now resolved. K 5.7 on [**4-8**]. EKG without peaked K waves
   or widened QRS.
   - Plan for HD
   - Recheck electrolytes QD
   .
   # Hematochezia/ulcerative colitis: Recent admission for anemia; thought
   to have recurrent lower GI angioectasia bleeding.  Pt currently with
   guaiac positive dark stools but stable Hct since last discharge.
   Hematochezia most c/w LGIB again rather than UGIB. As patient has no no
   abdominal cramping, this does not seem to be a UC flare. Pt with [**Doctor Last Name **]
   antibody. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] (GI) notified: agreed with continuing asacol; can
   call formal consult if needed. Pt with diarrhea for several days while
   on ciprofloxacin, likely related to antibiotic rather than acute UC
   flare; now resolved; C. Diff is negative
   - Active T&S
   - Trend Hct daily; transfuse for Hgb > 8 (received one unit on [**4-3**] and
   another on [**4-4**] with appropriate bump)
   - Cont home po PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Pt refusing asacol 800mg tid (says she vomits with this pill)
 has
   now missed several doses. Emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6753**] to make aware; will make
   formal GI consult if pt becomes symptomatic and continues to refuse
   medication. Patient asymptomatic presently.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: BUN 100, Cr 2.5 on admission
   (baseline 1.7) Likely decreased renal perfusion in setting of
   decompensated heart failure and hypotension. Improving on CVVH. FeNA =
   5.8%, FeUN = 31%. Repeat FeUN 23%.
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1948**] (Renal) notified and will follow while patient is in house
   - Renal recs: CVVH discontinued [**4-7**] with plan for HD [**4-8**], transfuse
   to keep Hgb > 8.0
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   # Elevated serum calcium: Secondary to calcium binding agents
 ionized
   calcium actually slightly low.
   - Will follow renal recs for best monitoring, maintenance of
   appropriate levels
   .
   # Hyponatremia. Resolved. Na 132 on [**4-8**] and K elevated. Likely due to
   renal failure and intravascular relative hypovolemia (supported by
   recent episodes of hypotension) with appropriate ADH secretion despite
   total body hypervolemia.
   - Electrolytes qd
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Resolving. Mild AST and Alk phos elevation; nl ALT and
   Tbili. No abd pain. Likely congestive hepatopathy.
   - Diuresis as above
   .
   # Nausea: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to uremia.  No evidence of gastroenteritis
   currently; abd benign.
   - Zofran prn
   .
   # Afib: Stable with slow ventricular response; not anticoagulated
   secondary to GI bleeding
   - Can restart metoprolol when pressures stabilized on HD
   .
   # H/o DM: Not on hypoglycemics. SS discontinued [**4-8**] as pt not
   requiring insulin. Cardiac healthy diet.
   .
   # Pain/difficulty sleeping. Pt reports diffuse pain in legs, arms,
everywhere but my stomach
. Possible component of anxiety.
   - continue home gabapentin; bengay also ordered
   - Continue pt
s oxycodone prn
   - Pt received trazodone [**4-4**] and [**4-5**] overnight
   - SW following pt; appreciate SW support. SW felt pt
s readmission in
   setting of possible med non-compliance may be related to underlying
   anxiety/feelings of sadness. Pt has not followed through on outpatient
   follow-up mental health visits in past.  Pt not currently interested in
   further psych/therapy eval; denies depression, expresses hope
   .
   # Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Resolved. Patient with severe diastolic heart
   failure, severe TR admitted with dyspnea, hypoxia. Likely due to volume
   overload (see above). She describes an acute onset which raises concern
   for an inciting event. Pt w/ leukocytosis at presentation (now
   resolved) but no fevers, cough, or clear consolidation suggestive of
   pneumonia.  Pt in chronic afib but rate controlled.  No CP to suggest
   ACS; EKG baseline and 2 sets CE neg. PE possible but no CP, tachycardia
   (on beta blocker), or hemoptysis; she does have chronic LLE edema, now
   ?L>R (same leg as hematoma). Thyroid dysfunction unlikely to provoke
   acute decompensation.  Per daughter, sx may have been worsening over
   the past week already; there may be a component of suboptimal
   dietary/med compliance in this pt with baseline dCHF that has been very
   difficult to manage.  Repeat TTE unchanged from prior. Episode of chest
   pain on [**4-2**] resolved; EKG unchanged, troponin 0.01->0.02.
   .
   # UTI: Ciprofloxacin [**2014-3-31**] for empiric treatment of UTI, empiric 3
   day course given no Foley on admission but has Foley now. Repeat UA on
   [**4-5**] still with bacteria; culture with 10-100K E. Coli (foley in
   place).
   -Foley catheter removed [**4-8**]
   -monitor clinically; pt asymptomatic [**4-9**]
   .
   # LLE fluctuant mass
 most likely hematoma, as documented in previous
   admission. Will watch for now.
   .
   # Ear pain. PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3879**]; examination with otoscope showed pristine EC
   and tympanic membranes without cerumen.
