   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is an 88 y.o female with h.o recent fall, SDH
   and neurosurgical procedure who presents with AMS.
   .
   #altered mental status- Unclear of pt's baseline. Pt recently admitted
   and discharged from the neurosurgical service for SDH, evacuation, then
   eventually trach and peg and discharge to rehab. Pt reportedly oriented
   to self, yr and location and able to follow simple commands. Of note,
   pt given a fluroquinolone for a suspected UTI. Etiologies could include
   structural/anatomic from a new/worsened or known SDH, however neurosurg
   states that her bleeds are stable, stroke or seizure, however the
   neurology consult service feels that this is not the case. Infection
   such as meningitis, UTI, PNA, etc are also possibilities. In terms of
   meningitis, neurology did not feel that an LP was indicated. Other
   possibilities include toxic metabolic. Pt with hyponatremia on lab
   findings. ACS is also a possibility, however there was a troponin bump
   in the absence of EKG changes and clinical symptoms.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint. The patient has a history of allergies to Lipitor and unspecified medications. They have received antibiotics, including Levofloxacin and Vancomycin. The patient is currently on multiple ICU medications.

Vital signs include a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/53 to 133/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 385 mL and output of 150 mL, with a balance of 235 mL. They are receiving IV fluids and blood products.

Respiratory support is provided through a tracheostomy mask, maintaining an oxygen saturation of 100%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) result is pending.

Physical examination findings include an altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and an inability to assess peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other parameters due to the patient's condition.

Assessment and plan include altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and ICU care. The patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic control measures, and has multiple lines inserted, including a multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are also being implemented.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include but are not limited to:
1. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing infections, such as pressure ulcers, catheter-related bloodstream infections, or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Thromboembolic events: Despite prophylactic measures for DVT, there is still a risk of developing thromboembolic events due to immobility and other risk factors.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can complicate further management and recovery.
4. Glycemic control issues: Maintaining tight glycemic control is crucial in the ICU setting. Any disturbances in glucose levels can have adverse effects on the patient's outcome.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored to prevent complications related to fluid overload or under-resuscitation.

It is important to note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of recent fall, subdural hemorrhage, and neurosurgical procedure who presents with altered mental status. The patient is currently at baseline mental status according to family, but the EEG shows ongoing epileptiform activity on the left side. There is concern for infection causing new pattern of seizure activity. Neurosurgery is hesitant to perform lumbar puncture given mass effect. An MRI has been suggested to evaluate for enhancement. Empiric antibiotics have been started for bacterial meningitis. The patient also has elevated troponin levels, new inferior wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram, and a history of hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status and concern for epileptiform activity may suggest a potential diagnosis of meningitis. This is supported by the fact that empiric antibiotics have been started. If left untreated, meningitis can lead to further neurological deterioration, sepsis, and potentially death.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's elevated troponin levels and new inferior wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram raise concern for ACS. If not managed appropriately, ACS can lead to myocardial infarction, heart failure, and potentially death.
3. Hypovolemia/Dehydration: The patient's hyponatremia may be secondary to hypovolemia/dehydration. If not corrected, this can"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old individual with altered mental status. They have a confirmed DNR/DNI code status and are considered for short-term intubation if reversible. The patient's echo shows new wall motion abnormality and increased MR. The EEG is concerning for epileptiform activity on the left side, with all prior surgeries being on the right side. Given the fever in the ED and new seizures on the left, Neurology wants Neurosurgery reconsulted to evaluate the risk of this being due to infection. LP is risky due to mass effect. The patient has no peripheral access for MRI with contrast, but peripheral access was obtained at 11 pm. The patient was reloaded with dilantin IV in the evening and restarted on dilantin 300mg po qd in the AM. 

The patient has allergies to Lipitor (Oral) (Atorvastatin Calcium) and an unspecified allergy. The last doses of antibiotics given were Levofloxacin at 04:15 AM, Vancomycin at 09:06 PM, and Ampicillin at 10:20 PM. The patient is receiving various ICU medications and other medications. There are no changes to the medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F) with a maximum temperature of 35.6 C (96.1 F), a heart rate of 79 bpm (71 - 88 bpm), a blood pressure range of 123/63 mmHg to 130/67 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (13 - 30 breaths per minute), and an oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheal mask. The patient is in sinus rhythm. The fluid balance shows a total input of 1,939 mL with 276 mL going into the stomach, 1,680 mL given intravenously, and 68 mL drained from the NG tube. The total output includes 2,030 mL of urine and 300 mL of blood products. There is a negative fluid balance of 91 mL. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a tracheal mask, and the ABG results are pending. The physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular status, skin, and neurologic assessment. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), decreased hemoglobin (Hct) and hematocrit (Hct), normal potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), bicarbonate (HCO3), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. The creatinine (Cr) level is within normal limits. Troponin-T is slightly decreased, and other cardiac enzymes and markers are within normal ranges. Liver function tests (ALT"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of recent fall, subdural hematoma (SDH), and neurosurgical procedure presenting with altered mental status. She has been admitted and discharged from the neurosurgical service for SDH evacuation, tracheostomy, and peg tube placement. The patient was oriented to self, year, and location and able to follow simple commands before admission. EEG shows ongoing epileptiform activity on the left side. There is a concern about infection causing new patterns of seizure activity. Neurosurgery is hesitant to perform lumbar puncture due to mass effect. MRI is suggested to evaluate for enhancement. Empiric antibiotics have been restarted for bacterial meningitis: Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, Ampicillin. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is also a concern, with a peak troponin of 0.23. No EKG changes, but echo shows new inferior hypokinesis. Heparin cannot be started due to SDH. Full-dose ASA has been restarted. Follow-up with neurology and neurosurgery recommendations, continue Keppra and Dilantin, obtain MRI, and continue with current medications.

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of recent fall, subdural hematoma (SDH), and neurosurgical procedure who presents with altered mental status. The patient was recently admitted and discharged from the neurosurgical service for SDH evacuation, then eventually tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement before being discharged to rehabilitation.

The patient's recent admission included a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) for which she was given a fluoroquinolone. The etiologies of her altered mental status could include structural/anatomic changes from a new or worsened subdural hematoma, seizure, stroke, or infection such as meningitis, UTI, pneumonia, etc. However, the neurology consult service feels that this is not the case. Infection, such as meningitis, is a possibility due to the presence of fever and new epileptiform activity on EEG. Neurosurgery is hesitant to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) given the mass effect.

The patient's lab results show hyponatremia, which could be secondary to hypovolemia/dehydration or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) given recent head trauma. There are no clear signs of congestive heart failure, liver disease, or renal disease at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of recent fall, subdural hematoma (SDH), and neurosurgical procedure who presents with altered mental status (AMS). The patient was admitted and discharged from the neurosurgical service for SDH evacuation, then eventually underwent tracheostomy and peg tube placement before being discharged to rehab. On admission, the patient was reportedly oriented to self, year, and location, and able to follow simple commands. However, the patient's baseline mental status is unclear.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Structural/anatomic issues from a new/worsened or known SDH.
2. Stroke or seizure.
3. Infection such as meningitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia (PNA), etc.
4. Toxic metabolic disturbances, including hyponatremia.
5. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), although there was a troponin bump in the absence of EKG changes and clinical symptoms.

Assessment and Plan:
- Neurosurgical recommendations: avoid fluorquinolones, obtain EEG, continue Kearns and dilantin, consider right hip X-ray.
- Neurological recommendations: avoid fluroquinolones, continue Keppra and dilantin.
- Continue current antibiotics (CTX/VANCO/AMPICILLIN) for now, likely to wean tomorrow.
- Follow up final head CT read.
- Serial neuro exams.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of recent fall, subdural hemorrhage (SDH), and neurosurgical procedure. She presents with altered mental status (AMS), which is consistent with her baseline mental status according to the family. The patient has been admitted and discharged from the neurosurgical service for SDH evacuation, tracheostomy, and peg tube placement. She was also given a fluoroquinolone for a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI).

Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's AMS could be due to structural/anatomic changes from a new/worsened or known SDH. However, neurosurgery states that her bleeds are stable. The EEG shows ongoing epileptiform activity on the left side, and there is concern that infection may be causing this new pattern of seizure activity. Neurosurgery is hesitant to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) given the mass effect, so an MRI is suggested to evaluate for enhancement. Empiric antibiotics for bacterial meningitis have been restarted.

2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's peak troponin level is 0.23, indicating a potential ACS. However, there are no EKG changes, but an echocardiogram shows a new inferior wall motion abnormality. Heparin cannot be started due to the presence of SDH. Full-dose aspirin (ASA) was restarted yesterday.

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of recent fall, subdural hematoma (SDH), and neurosurgical procedure who presents with altered mental status (AMS). The patient was admitted and discharged from the neurosurgical service for SDH evacuation, tracheostomy, and peg tube placement. She was reportedly oriented to self, year, and location, and able to follow simple commands.

Possible etiologies for the AMS include structural/anatomic from a new/worsened or known SDH, stroke, seizure, infection such as meningitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, toxic metabolic, or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, ACS is less likely due to the absence of EKG changes and clinical symptoms.

The patient has hyponatremia on lab findings, which could be secondary to hypovolemia/dehydration or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) given recent head trauma.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of recent fall, subdural hematoma (SDH), and neurosurgical procedure who presents with altered mental status (AMS). The patient's mental status is currently at baseline, according to family reports. She was recently admitted and discharged from the neurosurgical service for SDH evacuation, tracheostomy, and peg tube placement, followed by discharge to rehab. The patient has been given a fluoroquinolone for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). Etiologies of AMS could include structural/anatomic changes from new/worsened or known SDH, but neurosurgery states that her bleeds are stable. EEG shows ongoing epileptiform activity on the left side. There is concern that infection may be causing new patterns of seizure activity. Neurosurgery is hesitant to perform lumbar puncture (LP) given mass effect. MRI is suggested to evaluate for enhancement. Empiric antibiotics for bacterial meningitis have been restarted: Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, Ampicillin. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is also a concern, with a peak troponin of 0.23. No EKG changes are observed, but echo shows new inferior hypokinesis. Heparin cannot be started in the setting of SDH. Full dose aspirin (ASA) was restarted yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female who presented with subdural hematoma (SDH) and is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status, which was initially suspected to be due to a change in exam after a neurosurgical procedure. However, it was determined that the patient is at her baseline, and confusion may have originated from a discharge summary error. The patient underwent an EEG yesterday, which raised the possibility of a seizure. An MRI was ordered today to assess for meningitis and focal enhancement. Antibiotics were restarted for suspected meningitis. Neurology and neurosurgery teams are following the case. There is also concern for hyponatremia, which may be due to hypovolemia/dehydration or SIADH following recent head trauma. The patient has a history of hypertension, elevated troponin levels without EKG changes, and hypothyroidism. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms and the restart of antibiotics suggest a possible infection in the central nervous system, such as meningitis.
2. Seizures: The EEG results raise the possibility of seizures, and adjustments to anti-seizure medications may be necessary.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels could be due to various causes, including hypovolemia/dehydration or SIADH. Further evaluation and management are required.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female who presented with altered mental status after a recent fall, subdural hematoma (SDH), and neurosurgical procedure. The patient has been experiencing encephalopathy, as indicated by an abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG). An MRI of the head is scheduled to be performed before resuming the EEG. The patient was given a dose of Dilantin intravenously and free Dilantin and Dilantin levels will be checked tomorrow morning as recommended by the neurologist.

The patient has a history of allergies to Lipitor (Atorvastatin Calcium) and unspecified medication. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Levofloxacin at 04:15 AM, Vancomycin at 08:00 AM, Ampicillin at 09:30 AM, and Ceftriaxone at 10:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including Dilantin through an infusion, as well as other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/54 to 128/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,674 mL, including 290 mL of parenteral fluids, 611 mL of tube feeding, and 623 mL of intravenous fluids. The total output consists of 800 mL of urine and 295 mL of blood products. The patient's respiratory support includes the use of a tracheal mask with 100% oxygen delivery, and the ABG results are pending.

During the physical examination, the patient appears alert but intermittently cooperative, with dry mucous membranes and bilateral periorbital ecchymoses. The patient's neck is supple, with no jugular venous distention or lymphadenopathy. The lungs show coarse breath sounds bilaterally, and the cardiovascular examination reveals a regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds and a harsh diastolic murmur at the apex. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. The extremities are warm and well perfused, with no edema or cyanosis. Neurological examination is difficult due to the patient's lack of verbal response and uncooperative behavior, but the patient can squeeze their right hand upon command and move it voluntarily. There is no movement in the left upper extremity or toes/feet upon command.

Laboratory results show elevated potassium levels at 540 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin (Hct) at 32.4, and platelet count within normal range at 483. Other lab values, including creatinine (Cr), troponin T,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female who presented with altered mental status after a recent fall and neurosurgical procedure. She has a history of AMS and encephalopathy on EEG. She is currently being treated with antibiotics for potential infection, phenytoin for seizures, and Dilantin for EEG monitoring. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has hypovolemic hyponatremia, hypertension, and elevated troponin levels. Her lab results show anemia, thrombocytosis, and electrolyte imbalances. She is receiving nutrition and medication through IV lines, and prophylactic measures are being taken for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, which suggests a concern for infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or worsening infection is important.
2. Seizures: The patient has a history of encephalopathy on EEG and is being treated with anticonvulsant medications. Seizure monitoring and management should continue.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hypovolemic hyponatremia, which needs to be closely monitored. Rapid correction of sodium levels can lead to complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is"

","Summary:
An 88-year-old female patient with a recent fall and neurosurgical procedure presents with acute mental status changes. The patient has been found to have encephalopathy on EEG and is awaiting an MRI of the head prior to resuming EEG. She was given a dose of Dilantin IV and her free Dilantin and Dilantin levels will be checked tomorrow morning as per neuro recommendations. The patient has allergies to Lipitor and unspecified medications. She received antibiotics including Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Ampicillin, and Ceftriaxone. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has a mild fever. Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 5 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy and her SpO2 is 100%. Physical examination reveals bilateral periorbital ecchymoses, a harsh distolic murmur at the apex of the heart, and no other significant findings. The patient's lab results indicate elevated sodium and potassium levels, along with slightly low hemoglobin and white blood cell count. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on empiric meningitis coverage with antibiotics, indicating concern for an infection. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
2. Seizure: The patient's EEG showed encephalopathy, suggesting possible seizure activity. Ensuring adequate seizure control with phenytoin is crucial.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male admitted to the ICU for altered mental status following a recent fall and neurosurgical procedure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/73 mmHg to 173/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient has a history of allergies to Lipitor and an unspecified medication. 

The patient has undergone several procedures, including placement of a PICC line, which was stopped after 592 mL of fluid infusion. The patient also received antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin) for suspected infection, and metoprolol infusion for cardiovascular support. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted below. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,280 mL and output of 1,025 mL, with a negative balance of 255 mL. 

Physical examination reveals bilateral periorbital ecchymoses, a harsh systolic murmur at the apex, and no clubbing or cyanosis. Neurological assessment shows the patient unable to assess orientation, not verbal, but able to squeeze the right hand to command. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, hyponatremia, and myocardial infarction. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and a recent 24-hour period involving placement and removal of a PICC line, administration of antibiotics, and various other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to impaired skin integrity and the presence of indwelling lines, including the PICC line. Additionally, the administration of antibiotics indicates a previous or ongoing infection.
2. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings show fluctuations within the normal range. It is important to monitor and manage blood pressure to prevent complications such as hypotension leading to organ perfusion issues or hypertension causing end-organ damage.
3. Delirium/Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may increase the risk of delirium. Delirium can lead to increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged ICU stay, and cognitive impairment upon discharge.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload or dehydration, which can contribute to pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, or other complications.
5. Respiratory Issues: The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. Monitoring for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ensuring"

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of fall, subdural hematoma (SDH), and neurosurgical procedure. The patient presented with altered mental status, which is currently at baseline. The acute change in mental status is likely due to a seizure, as indicated by the EEG. The patient is currently on phenytoin and levetiracetam. The EEG has improved with the medication. The patient's blood pressure is controlled with home regimen. The patient has hypovolemic hyponatremia, but it is stable. The troponin levels are elevated but stable, with no ECG changes and the patient being asymptomatic, making it unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient also has hypothyroidism, which will be managed with outpatient Synthroid. There is concern about the coiled PICC line, and replacement may be necessary. The patient is receiving nutrition through Nutren 2.0 at a rate of 40 mL/hour.
