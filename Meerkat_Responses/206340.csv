 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   This is a 68 yo M with extensive Hx of hospitalization for COPD
   exacerbation as well as multiple lower GI bleeds admitted for
   hematochezia.
   .
   # Hematochezia: likely diverticular bleed given history of signficant
   diverticula.  He has had 1 prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed
   in [**2-14**] for which only sources identified on scope were diverticula.
   Other potential etiologies include internal hemorrhoids.  Colonic mass
   is less likely given multiple prior scopes in past 9 years. Upper GI
   bleed less likely given absence of melena and clear NGL.  Is on chronic
   steroids so is at risk for gastritis. Given no prior source
   definitively identified previously, small bowel sources are also
   possible.
   -Has CVL in place as well as PIVs for recusitation
   -Q6 Hct today
   -IV PPI for now, given pt's steroid use should likely be on [**Hospital1 **] oral
   PPI at home.
   -Stool cx given crampy pain with bloody stool r/o infectious
   colitis/dysentery although less likely.
   -GI involvement appreciated. Discuss with them utility of repeat scope
   vs possible capsule study.
   -Hold aspirin given bleed
   -Consider outpatient vs inpatient surgical eval given presumed
   recurrent diverticular bleed for eval for partial colectomy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and multiple lower GI bleeds. He is currently admitted for hematochezia, likely due to diverticular bleeding. The patient has had a prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed in [**2-14**], where diverticula were identified as the source. Other potential causes include internal hemorrhoids or a colonic mass. The absence of melena and clear NG tube suggests a lower GI bleed rather than an upper GI bleed. The patient is on chronic steroids, which increases the risk of gastritis. Small bowel sources are also possible given no prior source definitively identified previously.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has been diagnosed with a gastrointestinal bleed, specifically a lower GI bleed likely caused by diverticular bleeding. The patient's CVL and PIVs are in place for resuscitation. A Q6 Hct today has been ordered, and the patient is on IV PPI. Stool culture has been obtained to rule out infectious colitis/dysentery. The patient will discuss the utility of a repeat scope versus a capsule study with GI involvement. Aspirin has been held due to the bleed. The patient may undergo an outpatient or inpatient surgical evaluation for a partial colectomy to address the presumed recurrent diverticular bleed.

Other medical conditions include COPD, for which the patient will continue home dose steroids, tiotropium"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and multiple lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds.
- He presented with hematochezia, likely due to diverticular bleeding, and has had a prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed in [**2-14**], where diverticula were identified as the source.
- Other potential causes of the GI bleed include internal hemorrhoids and gastritis, but these are less likely.
- The patient is on chronic steroids, which puts him at risk for gastritis.
- He has a central venous line (CVL) and peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines for resuscitation.
- The plan includes discontinuing the CVL tomorrow, checking hemoglobin (Hct) every six hours, switching proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to oral, discussing the utility of repeat scope versus capsule study with GI involvement, holding aspirin due to the bleed, and considering outpatient surgical evaluation for partial colectomy.
- The patient's COPD is at baseline, and he will continue with his home dose of steroids, tiotropium, and albuterol nebs as needed.
- He will receive maintenance intravenous fluids (IVF) while nothing by mouth (NPO), and NPO until his Hct is stable and a gastrointestinal consult is staffed.
- In the ICU, the patient will receive clear liquids, continue with glycemic control,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest tightness and shortness of breath. He had a 16-second ventricular tachycardia and pointed towards his neck. Nebulizers were administered, and an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and electrolytes were ordered. The symptoms resolved quickly, and the cardiac enzymes and electrolytes were within normal limits. The patient's IJ line was discontinued, and a chest X-ray showed a pneumothorax on the left side, which resolved after another chest X-ray was performed 5 hours later.

The patient has allergies to Levaquin (oral) and sulfameth/trimethoprim DS. He is currently on multiple medications including albuterol, calcium carbonate, fentanyl patch, insulin, montelukast sodium, omeprazole, oxycodone-acetaminophen, pravastatin, prednisone, sarna lotion, sodium chloride flush, tiotropium bromide, vitamin D, and zolpidem tartrate.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 81 bpm (range 81-115 bpm), blood pressure of 98/51 mmHg (range 98/44-148/69 mmHg), respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (range 13-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient received a total of 1,211 mL of fluids, had an output of 1,020 mL, and lost 191 mL through IV fluids. He also received blood products totaling 1,550 mL, with an output of 400 mL. His urine output was also 1,550 mL, and he had negative NG and stool outputs. Drainage was -340 mL, and his respiratory support included oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 95%. His ABG results were not provided.

The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments were not conducted. His lab results showed a white blood cell count of 15.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.6%, platelet count of 250 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, troponin-T level of <0.01 ng/mL, glucose level of 108 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits. His chest X-rays from July 20th to July 22nd showed a small left apical pneumothorax without mediastinal shift on the first X-ray but resolved by the second X-ray. His HCT values decreased from 29.6% to 23.8% over the course of the days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and multiple lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. He was admitted for hematochezia, which is likely due to a diverticular bleed given his history of significant diverticula. Other potential etiologies include internal hemorrhoids, colonic mass, and small bowel sources. The patient is on chronic steroids, which puts him at risk for gastritis. No prior source of bleeding has been definitively identified, so small bowel sources are also possible.

Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's main concern is his ongoing lower GI bleed, likely caused by diverticula. Other potential causes include internal hemorrhoids, colonic masses, and small bowel sources. The patient has a history of prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed, identified with diverticula as the source. He is at risk for gastritis due to chronic steroid use.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient experienced a pneumothorax on the left side, but it resolved by the next day.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmia: The patient had a 16-second ventricular tachycardia (Vtach) episode accompanied by chest tightness and shortness of breath (SOB). However, these symptoms quickly resolved after nebs were started, and cardiac enzymes and electrolytes were normal. An EKG was obtained during the event, but the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and multiple lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. He was admitted for hematochezia, which is likely due to diverticular bleeding given his significant diverticula history. The patient had one prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed, where only diverticula were identified as sources. Other potential causes of the bleed include internal hemorrhoids, colonic masses, and small bowel sources. He is at risk for gastritis due to chronic steroid use.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/51 mmHg to 148/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed no chest pain, shortness of breath, or murmurs. There was mild tenderness in the abdomen, and no edema was noted. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). The creatinine (Cr) level was within normal range, while the troponin-T level was below the detection limit. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and multiple lower GI bleeds. He was admitted for hematochezia and is suspected to have a diverticular bleed given his history of significant diverticula. Other potential causes include internal hemorrhoids, colonic mass, or small bowel sources. The patient is on chronic steroids, which puts him at risk for gastritis. He has undergone several prior colonoscopies over the past 9 years, with no definitive source identified previously.

Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presents with hematochezia and a history of prior lower GI bleeds. A diverticular bleed is suspected, but other potential etiologies such as internal hemorrhoids, colonic mass, or small bowel sources need to be considered. The patient is at risk for gastritis due to chronic steroid use.
2. Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia (NSVT): The patient experienced a 16-second episode of VT with chest tightness and shortness of breath. His enzymes and EKG were within normal limits, so he was monitored on telemetry. There is a history of VT in the medical chart, possibly due to spontaneous pneumothorax from a bleb rupture, but it is unclear if there was actually a pneumothorax since it was not apparent on follow-up CXR.
3. COPD: The patient has a baseline"
