   24 Hour Events:
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with dementia, hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent UGIB, was
   transferred from [**Hospital3 2469**] nursing home after being found on the
   floor with respiratory distress. BP 99/58, HR 106, O2 sat 90% ->
   improved to 94% with suctioning. Patient was alert and oriented x 2,
   similar to baseline.
   Of note, patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 1**] on [**2105-11-6**] after 6-day
   admission for duodenal bleed. Hct was in mid-20s on discharge.
   On presentation to [**Hospital1 1**] ED, rectal temp 100.6, HR 106, 97/58, RR 17,
   O2 sat 100% on NRB. He was dyspneic with rhonchi throughout on exam.
   CXR was unremarkable, but WBC was 13 with a left shift. ABG was
   7.51/28/207. Patient was intubated due to increased work of breathing.
   Post-intubation CXR showed ET tube in proper location. NGT was placed.
   SBP transiently dropped to 80s, improved quickly with IVF boluses. Was
   given vancomycin 1000 mg IV x 1 and pip-tazo 4.5 gm IV x 1.

   respiratory difficulty, intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: with diffuse rhonchi, increased work of
   breathing on presentation, necessitating intubation. CXR was
   unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left shift, and exam
   findings are concerning for pneumonia. Pre-intubation ABG was
   consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly man who is currently intubated and admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/40 mmHg to 146/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has received various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, ranging from 89/40 mmHg to 146/111 mmHg. This could be due to septic shock or other causes of hypoperfusion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The ABG results show a pH of 7.47, indicating respiratory alkalosis. There are also signs of coarse bilateral breath sounds from anterior. These findings suggest the possibility of acute respiratory failure, which may not be ARDS based on the assessment.
3. Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH): The patient has a history of BPH, which may contribute to urinary retention and other related complications.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension, respiratory failure, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 97 bpm (84-111), blood pressure of 146/52 (73) mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (14-30), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 28 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and increased creatinine level. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly lower than normal, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he is dependent on mechanical ventilation. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is suspected but not confirmed. Respiratory failure can result in inadequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal.

3. Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH): The patient has a known diagnosis of BPH,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and respiratory difficulty. He was admitted overnight and received a blood transfusion due to anemia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been experiencing respiratory distress with diffuse rhonchi and increased work of breathing, which necessitated intubation. His oxygen saturation has improved after suctioning, suggesting it is unlikely to be a pulmonary embolism. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, suggesting possible pneumonia or aspiration. Urinary Legionella Ag test was negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia or aspiration: The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress, coarse bilateral breath sounds, and leukocytosis with a left shift raise concerns for pneumonia or aspiration. Continued suctioning and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.
2. Anemia: The patient has a history of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, and his hemoglobin level is low. Further evaluation and management of anemia, including monitoring the hemoglobin level and continuing steroids and danazol therapy, should be considered.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine level has increased from 1.2 to 2.2 on discharge. This could be due to prerenal azotemia, possibly related to dehydration or blood transfusion. IV fluid resuscitation should be continued, and close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin T level is elevated, which may be related to acute renal failure or myocardial injury. Repeat ECG and further evaluation should be considered.
5. Duodenal ulcers: The patient has a history of duodenal ulcers, but H. pylori serology is negative. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy should be continued.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings should be implemented.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to mechanical ventilation. Measures such as head of bed elevation and oral care should be continued to prevent VAP."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and hemolytic anemia. He was admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and respiratory distress, necessitating intubation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure that is responsive to intravenous fluid boluses. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation, and supplemental oxygen. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, acute kidney injury, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's pneumonia and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory infections.
2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's intermittent hypotension may indicate ongoing hypoperfusion and the need for continuous monitoring and management.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine level suggests AKI, which could be due to prerenal azotemia caused by dehydration or intrinsic renal damage.
4. Hemolytic Anemia: The patient has a history of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, and further evaluation is needed to assess the cause and severity of the condition.
5. Delirium or Unresponsiveness: The patient's unresponsiveness may be attributed to sedation and infection, but it could also be related to underlying dementia or other neurological issues. Monitoring for changes in mental status and considering"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of HTN, UGIB, hemolytic anemia, here with
   LLL pneumonia, intubated for respiratory distress.
   > Respiratory distress: significant sputum at NH per report with
   improved O2 sat after suctioning. Here with diffuse rhonchi, increased
   work of breathing on presentation, necessitating intubation. CXR was
   remarkable for LLL process with fever, leukocytosis with left shift,
   and exam findings are concerning for pneumonia, ?aspiration.
   Pre-intubation ABG was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.
   Legionella negative. GPC on sputum gram stain.
   - Continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo
   - F/u sputum and blood cx
   - Although patient on minimal vent settings and likely could be
   extubated from a respiratory standpoint, will continue invasive
   ventilation given hypotension and unresponsiveness.
   - Wean O2 to 40%
   - Repeat VBG
   > Hypotension: Intermittent, responsive to IVF boluses.
   - Will follow
   - Levophed prn to keep MAPs >55
   - Random cortisol 24.6, so unlikely adrenally insufficient, but since
   on standing pred at home and hypotensive, will put empirically on
   stress dose steroids in attempt to avoid pressors.  Hydrocortisone 50mg
   q6h.
   > Anemia: Hct 23.4 today, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on [**2105-11-6**].
   History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia. Tbili 2.3, which is down
   from last admission; hemolysis labs unremarkable.

   ICU attending
   Patient seen and examined with the ICU fellow, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2256**].
   Patient remains hypotensive, responsive to fluids but requiring
   multiple fluid boluses in succession. Urine output trailing off; now
   less than 40 cc/hour for several hours. Patient is unresponsive off of
   sedation.
   On exam, patient is intubated and sedated. Pupils are small. No
   icterus. Chest is clear anterior and lateral exam. Heart sounds are
   soft with no gallop. There is a II/VI systolic murmur at the base.
   Abdomen with diminished bowel sounds. Soft and nontender. Extremities
   with 2+ edema. Warm and well perfused.
   CXR shows retrocardiac infiltrate vs atelectasis with air bronchograms.
   Labs: creat down to 1.7 this AM. Bicarb 18.
   Patient switched to PSV 5/5. VE is now 10L/min. Last ABG showed acute
   respiratory alkalosis.
   IMPRESSION:
   Pneumonia
   Acute respiratory failure
   Acute renal failure
   Hypotension
   Anemia
   Altered mental status
   Patient doing better with respect to acute respiratory failure. FIO2
   reduced to 0.3 on rounds. O2 sats remain at 100%.  Not clear why he has
   primary respiratory alkalosis; may have stimulation of pulmonary
   receptors from pneumonia/atelectasis. Continue on antibiotics for
   possible pneumonia. Maintain on PSV at this time.
   Hypotension likely related to low SVR from infection. Appears still to
   be intravascularly volume depleted. Continuing with fluid
   resuscitation. With onset of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis from NS
   fluids, would switch to lactated Ringers solution. Concern about drop
   in urine output; may have high resistance in renal artery and need
   greater driving pressure to perfuse the kidneys. Will place central
   line to assess filling pressures and to enable administration of
   vasopressors if higher driving pressure is in fact needed to perfuse
   kidneys. Initial rise in creat likely reflects hypotension and possible
   mild ATN.
   Hct stable. No evidence of bleeding. Not at transfusion threshold at
   this time.
   Altered mental status now likely reflects residual effect of sedation.
   Hypoperfusion may also be playing a role. Continue to hold sedation.
   Attempt to increase blood pressure with fluids and possibly
   vasopressors pending CVP assessment.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and hemolytic anemia. He was admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia, respiratory distress, and intubated. The patient remains hypotensive, responsive to IV fluid boluses, and unresponsive. The respiratory distress has improved after suctioning, with diffuse rhonchi and increased work of breathing. The chest X-ray shows a left lower lobe process, fever, leukocytosis with a left shift, and concern for pneumonia, possibly aspiration. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 95/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support. 

The patient has been on minimal vent settings and could potentially be extubated from a respiratory standpoint, but will continue invasive ventilation due to hypotension and unresponsiveness. The plan is to wean the oxygen to 40% and repeat the venous blood gas.

The patient also has hypotension, which is intermittent and responsive to IV fluid boluses. The blood pressure remains low despite fluids, so Levophed will be used as needed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 55 mmHg. A random cortisol level of 24.6 indicates that adrenal"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and hemolytic anemia. He presents with left lower lobe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and has been intubated. He is currently unresponsive and experiencing intermittent hypotension responsive to intravenous fluids. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels indicating acute kidney injury, and abnormal cardiac enzymes. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors for blood pressure support, stress dose steroids, and aggressive fluid resuscitation. The assessment and plan include continuing respiratory support, monitoring for infection, managing hypotension, treating anemia, addressing acute kidney injury, and providing nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure if not treated appropriately.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's respiratory distress and current mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing ARDS, a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli.
3. Sepsis: With elevated white blood cell count and leukocytosis with a left shift, the patient is at risk of developing sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by infection.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels suggest"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's medical history includes sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), and altered mental status (not delirium). 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/71 mmHg to 136/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 10 mmHg.

The patient has received multiple interventions including vasopressin and levophed infusions, initiation of stress dose steroids, tube feeds, and administration of antibiotics (piperacillin and tazobactam). 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, but other parameters such as blood glucose, creatinine (Cr), and electrolytes are within normal limits. Troponin-T levels are negative, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction.

The patient's respiratory support includes endotracheal intubation with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set tidal volume"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of HTN, hemolytic anemia, here with
   respiratory difficulty, intubated.
   # Respiratory distress: significant sputum at NH per report with
   improved O2 sat after suctioning. Here with diffuse rhonchi, increased
   work of breathing on presentation, necessitating intubation. CXR was
   unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left shift, and exam
   findings are concerning for pneumonia, ?aspiration. Pre-intubation ABG
   was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis. Given improvement of
   O2 saturation on suctioning, unlikely to be PE. Urinary Legionella Ag
   negative.
   - continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo for now
   - sputum cx
   - blood cx
   - continue invasive ventilation for now; will decrease FiO2 and recheck
   VBG
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - monitor fever curve, trend WBC
   - sedation and analgesia prn for comfort
   # Anemia: Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on
   [**2105-11-6**]. History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia. Tbili 2.3, down
   from last admission; hemolysis labs unremarkable. Hct increased to 29
   after 3 units of pRBCs.
   - trend Hct
   - continue steroids (now hydrocort), danazol 400 [**Hospital1 **] for now
   # ARF: Cr 2.2 from 1.2 on discharge on [**2105-11-6**]. BUN also elevated to
   37. Likely prerenal azotemia. Cr trended down to 1.7 with IVF
   resuscitation.
   - IVF prn
   # Elevated troponin: trop T 0.09 on presentation, CK 64, ECG with <1mm
   lateral ST depressions in V4 only. Trop 0.07 this morning. Likely
   elevated troponin in setting of ARF.
   - repeat ECG
   # Duodenal ulcers: H. pylori serology negative.
   - no more clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and respiratory difficulty. He presented with significant sputum production, diffuse rhonchi, and increased work of breathing, necessitating intubation. His initial ABG was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis, and he showed improvement in oxygen saturation after suctioning. There were concerns for pneumonia or aspiration, but urinary Legionella Ag was negative. He is being treated empirically with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and further diagnostic tests such as sputum and blood cultures are planned. Invasive ventilation is ongoing, with plans to decrease FiO2 and recheck VBG. A repeat chest X-ray is also planned for tomorrow.

The patient has a history of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and has received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), resulting in an increased hemoglobin concentration of 29. Trending Hct is recommended. He is also being treated with steroids and danazol for his anemia.

He has acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 2.2 from 1.2 on discharge, likely prerenal azotemia. The patient's BUN is elevated to 37. With IVF resuscitation, his creatinine trended down to 1.7. IVF is to be given as needed.

There is also evidence of elevated troponin, possibly due to ARF. Repeat ECG is advised.

The patient has duodenal ulcers, but H. pylori serology is negative. PPI therapy will be continued.

Nutrition is being provided through Fibersource HN at a rate of 45 mL/hour. The patient has multiple lines in place, including an 18-gauge and 20-gauge line, as well as a multi-lumen catheter. Prophylaxis measures include DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of HTN, hemolytic anemia, here with
   respiratory difficulty, intubated.
   # Respiratory distress: significant sputum at NH per report with
   improved O2 sat after suctioning. Here with diffuse rhonchi, increased
   work of breathing on presentation, necessitating intubation. CXR was
   unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left shift, and exam
   findings are concerning for pneumonia, ?aspiration. Pre-intubation ABG
   was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis. Given improvement of
   O2 saturation on suctioning, unlikely to be PE. Urinary Legionella Ag
   negative.
   - continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo for now
readjusted for improved
   renal function
   - sputum cx
   - blood cx
   - continue in CPAP ventilation, if mental status improves can consider
   extubation
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - monitor fever curve, trend WBC
   - sedation and analgesia prn for comfort
   # Hypotension: started levophed and vasopressin. Levophed weaned off
   -- vasopressin for 24 more hr, then attempt to stop
   # Anemia: Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on
   [**2105-11-6**]. History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia. Tbili 2.3, down
   from last admission; hemolysis labs unremarkable. Hct increased to 29
   after 3 units of pRBCs.
   - trend Hct - stable
   - continue steroids (now hydrocort)
 wean hydrocort to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - danazol 400 [**Hospital1 **] for now
   # ARF: Cr 2.2 from 1.2 on discharge on [**2105-11-6**]. BUN also elevated to
   37. Likely prerenal azotemia. Cr trended down to 1.4 with IVF
   resuscitation.
   - IVF prn
   - Renally dose meds
   - Check urine lytes to see if component of ATN given persistent low UOP
   and recent hypotension
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely due to renal failure. Check lytes [**Hospital1 **],
   consider giving bicarb if planning extubation b/b low bicarb
   -- Trend, anticipate resolution
   # Hyperglycemia: in setting of stress dose steroids
   - HISS
   # Elevated troponin: trop T 0.09 on presentation, CK 64, ECG with <1mm
   lateral ST depressions in V4 only. Trop 0.07 this morning. Likely
   elevated troponin in setting of ARF.
   - repeat ECG
   # Duodenal ulcers: H. pylori serology negative.
   - no more clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]

   Code status: FULL
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and respiratory difficulty. The patient was intubated due to significant sputum production, diffuse rhonchi, and increased work of breathing. The initial chest X-ray (CXR) was unremarkable, but there are concerns for pneumonia or aspiration given the fever, leukocytosis with a left shift, and exam findings. The pre-intubation arterial blood gas (ABG) showed acute respiratory alkalosis, suggesting respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate (HR) of 97 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 133/71 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. The patient's mental status is attentive and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, but otherwise normal kidney function tests. The patient has a history of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, and hemolysis labs are unremarkable. The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), resulting in an increased hematocrit (Hct) level of 29.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin (Vanco), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn),"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of HTN, UGIB, hemolytic anemia, here with
   LLL pneumonia, intubated for respiratory distress.
   > Respiratory distress: significant sputum at NH per report with
   improved O2 sat after suctioning. Here with diffuse rhonchi, increased
   work of breathing on presentation, necessitating intubation. CXR was
   remarkable for LLL process with fever, leukocytosis with left shift,
   and exam findings are concerning for pneumonia, ?aspiration.
   Pre-intubation ABG was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.
   Legionella negative. GPC on sputum gram stain.
   - Continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo
   - F/u sputum and blood cx
   - Although patient on minimal vent settings and likely could be
   extubated from a respiratory standpoint, will continue invasive
   ventilation given hypotension and slowing improving mental status
   (likely all sedation
 head CT negative). Maybe in am if off pressors
   and mental status improved.
   > Hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis with low UOP.
   - Levophed off this am. Will continue vasopressin x 24 more hours.
   - Random cortisol 24.6, so unlikely adrenally insufficient, but since
   on standing pred at home and hypotensive, will put empirically on
   stress dose steroids in attempt to avoid pressors.
   > Anion gap (18) with low bicarb:  Concern for new metabolic acidosis
   superimposed upon respiratory alkalosis.
   - Recheck ABG
 7.39/23/109 c/w anion gap metabolic acidosis, maybe [**1-17**]
   ARF? Low bicarb could present difficulties when extubating.  Will
   follow for now and consider giving bicarb prior to extubation if not
   improving.
   > Anemia: Hct 23.4 today, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on [**2105-11-6**].
   History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia. Tbili 2.3, which is down

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hypertension, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolytic anemia, and recent left lower lobe pneumonia. He was intubated for respiratory distress, which improved after suctioning. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis with a left shift, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine. His arterial blood gas (ABG) is consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis. Chest X-ray findings indicate pneumonia, possibly aspiration-related. The patient is currently on minimal ventilator settings and may be extubated soon. However, hypotension and a slowing improving mental status suggest continuing invasive ventilation. The patient's anion gap is elevated, indicating a new metabolic acidosis superimposed on respiratory alkalosis. His hemoglobin levels are low, likely due to a history of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. The patient's renal function has worsened, showing acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 2.2 (baseline 1.0-1.2). There are concerns about potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and poor glycemic control. The patient is currently receiving empiric vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of HTN, UGIB, hemolytic anemia, here with
   LLL pneumonia, intubated for respiratory distress.
   > Respiratory distress: significant sputum at NH per report with
   improved O2 sat after suctioning. Here with diffuse rhonchi, increased
   work of breathing on presentation, necessitating intubation. CXR was
   remarkable for LLL process with fever, leukocytosis with left shift,
   and exam findings are concerning for pneumonia, ?aspiration.
   Pre-intubation ABG was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.
   Legionella negative. GPC on sputum gram stain.
   - Continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo
   - F/u sputum and blood cx
   - Although patient on minimal vent settings and likely could be
   extubated from a respiratory standpoint, will continue invasive
   ventilation given hypotension and unresponsiveness.
   - Wean O2 to 40%
   - Repeat VBG
   > Hypotension: Intermittent, responsive to IVF boluses.
   - Will follow
   - Levophed prn to keep MAPs >55
   - Random cortisol 24.6, so unlikely adrenally insufficient, but since
   on standing pred at home and hypotensive, will put empirically on
   stress dose steroids in attempt to avoid pressors.  Hydrocortisone 50mg
   q6h.

","The patient is a 91-year-old male with a history of hypertension, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and hemolytic anemia, presenting with left lower lobe pneumonia and respiratory distress. He was intubated for respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypotension and unresponsiveness. The patient has intermittent hypotension responsive to IV fluid boluses, anemia with a Hct of 23.4, acute renal failure with a Cr of 2.2 (now 1.7), and is unresponsive likely due to sedation and infection in the setting of dementia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening respiratory distress, pneumonia, acute respiratory alkalosis, acute respiratory acidosis, hypotension leading to shock, acute kidney injury, worsening anemia, and prolonged sedation or delirium. 

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary to determine the exact medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of HTN, UGIB, hemolytic anemia, here with
   LLL pneumonia, intubated for respiratory distress.
   > Respiratory distress: significant sputum at NH per report with
   improved O2 sat after suctioning. Here with diffuse rhonchi, increased
   work of breathing on presentation, necessitating intubation. CXR was
   remarkable for LLL process with fever, leukocytosis with left shift,
   and exam findings are concerning for pneumonia, ?aspiration.
   Pre-intubation ABG was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.
   Legionella negative. GPC on sputum gram stain.
   - Continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo
   - F/u sputum and blood cx
   - Although patient on minimal vent settings and likely could be
   extubated from a respiratory standpoint, will continue invasive
   ventilation given hypotension and slowing improving mental status
   (likely all sedation
 head CT negative). Maybe in am if off pressors
   and mental status improved.
   > Hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis with low UOP.
   - Levophed off this am. Will continue vasopressin x 24 more hours.
   - Random cortisol 24.6, so unlikely adrenally insufficient, but since
   on standing pred at home and hypotensive, will put empirically on
   stress dose steroids in attempt to avoid pressors.
   > Anion gap (18) with low bicarb:  Concern for new metabolic acidosis
   superimposed upon respiratory alkalosis.
   - Recheck ABG
 7.39/23/109 c/w anion gap metabolic acidosis, maybe [**1-17**]
   ARF? Low bicarb could present difficulties when extubating.  Will
   follow for now and consider giving bicarb prior to extubation if not
   improving.
   > Anemia: Hct 23.4 today, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on [**2105-11-6**].
   History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia. Tbili 2.3, which is down
   from last admission; hemolysis labs unremarkable.
   - Will follow
   - Continue home regimen of prednisone 10 daily, danazol 400 [**Hospital1 **]
   > ARF: Cr 2.2 , now 1.4 (baseline 1.0-1.2). Likely prerenal azotemia.
   But, UOP still poor at 10cc/hr
   - Continue to follow.  Consider lasix if BP stable.
   - Check urine lytes.
   > BPH: s/p TURP with difficult foley placement
 ultimately placed
   under direct visualization by urology
   - Intermittent bladder irrigation via 3-way foley for traumatic
   hematuria

","The patient is a 91-year-old man with a history of hypertension, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and hemolytic anemia, currently admitted for left lower lobe pneumonia. He was intubated due to respiratory distress and is being mechanically ventilated. The patient has shown improvement in oxygen saturation after suctioning but still has diffuse rhonchi on examination, suggesting pneumonia, possibly aspiration. 

His blood pressure is low, likely secondary to sepsis, and he has a decreased urine output. Levophed was stopped, and vasopressin is being continued. A random cortisol level was within normal range, so adrenal insufficiency is unlikely. However, considering his use of oral glucocorticoids, he has been empirically started on stress dose steroids to avoid the need for vasopressors.

The patient also has an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis superimposed on respiratory alkalosis. This could be due to acute renal failure (ARF), as his creatinine levels have risen from baseline. However, his urine output is still poor, indicating possible prerenal azotemia. Lasix may be considered if his blood pressure is stable, and urine electrolytes should be checked.

The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, consistent with his history of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. However, his bilirubin levels have decreased, and hemolysis labs are unremarkable.

In terms of other medical issues, the patient underwent transureth"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of HTN, UGIB, hemolytic anemia, here with
   LLL pneumonia, intubated for respiratory distress.
   > Respiratory distress: significant sputum at NH per report with
   improved O2 sat after suctioning. Here with diffuse rhonchi, increased
   work of breathing on presentation, necessitating intubation. CXR was
   remarkable for LLL process with fever, leukocytosis with left shift,
   and exam findings are concerning for pneumonia, ?aspiration.
   Pre-intubation ABG was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.
   Legionella negative. GPC on sputum gram stain.
   - Continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo
   - F/u sputum and blood cx
   - Although patient on minimal vent settings and likely could be
   extubated from a respiratory standpoint, will continue invasive
   ventilation given hypotension and slowing improving mental status
   (likely all sedation
 head CT negative). Maybe in am if off pressors
   and mental status improved.
   > Hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis with low UOP.
   - Levophed off this am. Will continue vasopressin x 24 more hours.
   - Random cortisol 24.6, so unlikely adrenally insufficient, but since
   on standing pred at home and hypotensive, will put empirically on
   stress dose steroids in attempt to avoid pressors.
   > Anion gap (18) with low bicarb:  Concern for new metabolic acidosis
   superimposed upon respiratory alkalosis.
   - Recheck ABG
 7.39/23/109 c/w anion gap metabolic acidosis, maybe [**1-17**]
   ARF? Low bicarb could present difficulties when extubating.  Will
   follow for now and consider giving bicarb prior to extubation if not
   improving.
   > Anemia: Hct 23.4 today, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on [**2105-11-6**].
   History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia. Tbili 2.3, which is down
   from last admission; hemolysis labs unremarkable.
   - Will follow
   - Continue home regimen of prednisone 10 daily, danazol 400 [**Hospital1 **]
   > ARF: Cr 2.2 , now 1.4 (baseline 1.0-1.2). Likely prerenal azotemia.
   But, UOP still poor at 10cc/hr
   - Continue to follow.  Consider lasix if BP stable.
   - Check urine lytes.
   > BPH: s/p TURP with difficult foley placement
 ultimately placed
   under direct visualization by urology
   - Intermittent bladder irrigation via 3-way foley for traumatic
   hematuria
   >GI/FEN:
   - PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and hemolytic anemia. He was admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and required intubation for respiratory distress. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 133/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation.

The patient's physical examination revealed crackles in the left lower lobe, distended abdomen, and decreased peripheral pulses. Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a left shift, elevated troponin T levels, and low platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes were within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient has diffuse rhonchi, increased work of breathing, and crackles in the left lower lobe. These findings are consistent with pneumonia, possibly aspiration. The plan is to continue empiric vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, follow-up sputum and blood cultures, and consider extubation once the patient's mental status improves and off pressors.

2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension likely secondary to sepsis with low urine output. The plan is"

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and respiratory difficulty. He presented with respiratory distress, significant sputum production, and diffuse rhonchi. He was intubated due to increased work of breathing. The initial chest X-ray was unremarkable, but there are concerns for pneumonia or aspiration. Pre-intubation arterial blood gas (ABG) showed acute respiratory alkalosis. Urinary Legionella antigen test was negative.

The patient has been on empiric vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics. His urine output has remained low despite decent central venous pressures (CVPs), and he is receiving 2.4 units per hour of vasopressin. His urine electrolytes are consistent with prerenal azotemia, and there are granular casts present. Serum creatinine and bicarbonate levels are slowly improving.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 123/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His height is 60 inches, and his weight is not mentioned. His CVP is 13 mmHg.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of HTN, hemolytic anemia, here with
   respiratory difficulty, intubated.
   # Respiratory distress: significant sputum at NH per report with
   improved O2 sat after suctioning. Here with diffuse rhonchi, increased
   work of breathing on presentation, necessitating intubation. CXR was
   unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left shift, and exam
   findings are concerning for pneumonia, ?aspiration. Pre-intubation ABG
   was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis. Given improvement of
   O2 saturation on suctioning, unlikely to be PE. Urinary Legionella Ag
   negative.
   - continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo for now
readjusted for improved
   renal function
   - sputum cx
   - blood cx
   - continue in CPAP ventilation, if mental status improves can consider
   extubation
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - monitor fever curve, trend WBC
   - sedation and analgesia prn for comfort
   # Hypotension: started levophed and vasopressin. Levophed weaned off
   -- vasopressin for 24 more hr, then attempt to stop
   # Anemia: Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on
   [**2105-11-6**]. History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia. Tbili 2.3, down
   from last admission; hemolysis labs unremarkable. Hct increased to 29
   after 3 units of pRBCs.
   - trend Hct - stable
   - continue steroids (now hydrocort)
 wean hydrocort to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - danazol 400 [**Hospital1 **] for now
   # ARF: Cr 2.2 from 1.2 on discharge on [**2105-11-6**]. BUN also elevated to
   37. Likely prerenal azotemia. Cr trended down to 1.4 with IVF
   resuscitation.
   - IVF prn
   - Renally dose meds
   - Check urine lytes to see if component of ATN given persistent low UOP
   and recent hypotension
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely due to renal failure. Check lytes [**Hospital1 **],
   consider giving bicarb if planning extubation b/b low bicarb
   -- Trend, anticipate resolution
   # Hyperglycemia: in setting of stress dose steroids
   - HISS
   # Elevated troponin: trop T 0.09 on presentation, CK 64, ECG with <1mm
   lateral ST depressions in V4 only. Trop 0.07 this morning. Likely
   elevated troponin in setting of ARF.
   - repeat ECG
   # Duodenal ulcers: H. pylori serology negative.
   - discontinued clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and respiratory difficulty. He presented with significant sputum production, diffuse rhonchi, increased work of breathing, and subsequent intubation. The initial chest X-ray was unremarkable, but his symptoms and exam findings are concerning for pneumonia, possibly aspiration. Pre-intubation ABG showed acute respiratory alkalosis. His urinary Legionella antigen was negative. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 123/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV ventilation with FiO2 of 30%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a left shift, elevated lactate levels, and signs of renal dysfunction with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL and elevated troponin levels indicating possible myocardial injury. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues including respiratory distress, hypotension requiring vasopressor support, anemia, acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, elevated cardiac enzymes, and duodenal ulcers. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and gastrointestinal bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting with respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently on CPAP ventilation. His condition is improving, but there are concerns about potential complications such as hypotension, anemia, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, duodenal ulcers, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is currently on vasopressin and levophed for hypotension. The goal is to wean off vasopressin after 24 hours and then attempt to stop it. However, there is a risk of persistent hypotension or septic shock if the underlying cause is not addressed.

2. Anemia: The patient has a history of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and is currently showing signs of anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL. The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is being monitored for further improvement. There is a risk of ongoing blood loss or hemolysis contributing to the anemia.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine levels have been increasing, indicating worsening renal function. The current level is 2.0 mg/dL,"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent
   admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting
   with respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure: Question aspiration event versus pneumonia.
   Significant sputum at NH per report with improved O2 sat after
   suctioning.  Here with diffuse rhonchi, increased work of breathing on
   presentation, necessitating intubation.  CXR was unremarkable, but
   fever, leukocytosis with left shift, and exam findings are concerning
   for pneumonia.  Pre-intubation ABG was consistent with acute
   respiratory alkalosis. Given improvement of O2 saturation on
   suctioning, unlikely to be PE. Urinary Legionella Ag negative.
   - continue in CPAP ventilation, if mental status improves can consider
   extubation
   - Continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo for now
readjusted for improved
   renal function
   - Sputum culture with 1+ GPC on gram stain but culture only yeast
   - Blood cultures no growth to date
   - Monitor fever curve, trend WBC
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but consider sepsis.  Initially on
   levophed and vasopressin on admission . Levophed weaned off yesterday.
   - Wean vasopressin today as tolerated
   # Anemia: Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on
   [**2105-11-6**].  Recent admission for GI bleed from duodenal ulcers.  History
   of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis labs unremarkable.
   Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of PRBC, now drifting down.
   - Trend HCT Q8H
   - Continue hydrocort to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - danazol 400 [**Hospital1 **] for now
   # ARF:Improving.  Cr 2.2 on admission to MICU from 1.2 on discharge on
   [**2105-11-6**]. BUN also elevated to 37. Likely prerenal azotemia. Cr trended
   down to 1.4 with IVF resuscitation.
   - IVF prn
   - Renally dose meds
   - Check urine lytes to see if component of ATN given persistent low UOP
   and recent hypotension
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved.  Likely due to renal failure. Check
   lytes [**Hospital1 **], consider giving bicarb if planning extubation b/b low bicarb
   -- Trend, anticipate resolution
   # Hyperglycemia: In setting of stress dose steroids.
   - HISS
   # Duodenal ulcers: H. pylori serology negative.
   - discontinued clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Elevated troponin: Likely elevated troponin in setting of ARF.  Trop
   T 0.09 on presentation, CK 64, ECG with <1mm lateral ST depressions in
   V4 only. Trop 0.07 this morning.
   - repeat ECG stable yesterday

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and gastrointestinal bleed from a duodenal ulcer, presenting with respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/64 mmHg to 136/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP mode, set at a pressure support of 5 cmH2O, peak inspiratory pressure of 13 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows pH 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 24 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 320 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse rhonchi bilaterally in the lungs, regular heart rhythm, and unpurposeful movements. The patient is attentive and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.9 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 37 mg/dL, serum creatinine (Cr) of 2.0 mg/dL, glucose of 195 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.07 ng/mL. Other lab values include potassium (K+) of 22 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 112 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 141 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3) of 25.5%, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.1 mg/dL, phosphorus (PO4) of 2.6 mg/dL, and albumin of 2.5 g/dL. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and urinary Legionella antigen is negative.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure with potential aspiration versus pneumonia, hypotension with unclear etiology but considering sepsis, anemia due to recent gastrointestinal bleed, acute renal failure (ARF) with improving renal function, metabolic acidosis resolved, hyperglycemia related to stress dose steroids, and elevated troponin likely due to ARF.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the patient develops further pneumonia or experiences ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The hypotension could progress to septic shock if the underlying cause is indeed sepsis. The anemia may worsen if the patient continues to bleed or if there is ongoing hemolysis. The ARF could deteriorate if the patient develops acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or if renal function continues to decline. The metabolic acidosis could recur if the patient's kidneys fail again. The hyperglycemia could worsen if the patient's stress response persists or if there are issues with insulin administration. Lastly, the elevated troponin indicates myocardial injury, which could be a sign of ongoing cardiac stress or ischemia.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, hemodynamic stability"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent
   admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting
   with respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure: RSBI 77 this morning.  Question pneumonia versus
   aspiration event.  Significant sputum at NH per report with improved O2
   sat after suctioning.  Here with diffuse rhonchi and increased work of
   breathing on presentation necessitating intubation on admission.  CXR
   was unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left shift, and exam
   findings concerning for pneumonia.  Pre-intubation ABG was consistent
   with acute respiratory alkalosis.  Given improvement of O2 saturation
   on suctioning, unlikely to be PE.
   - Extubate today
   - Continue empiric zosyn/vancomycin for [**9-29**] day course
   - Sputum culture with 1+ GPC on gram stain but culture only yeast;
   urinary Legionella Ag negative.
   - Blood cultures no growth to date
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but likely due to sepsis.  Initially on
   levophed and vasopressin on admission . Levophed weaned off yesterday.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and gastrointestinal bleed from a duodenal ulcer, presenting with respiratory failure. The patient was intubated on admission due to increased work of breathing and diffuse rhonchi. His pre-intubation ABG showed acute respiratory alkalosis. The CXR was unremarkable, but he has fever, leukocytosis with a left shift, and exam findings concerning for pneumonia. The sputum culture showed yeast but no bacteria, and urinary Legionella antigen was negative. Blood cultures have no growth to date.

The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology but is likely due to sepsis. Initially, he was on levophed and vasopressin, and levophed was weaned off yesterday. The plan is to wean vasopressin today. His anemia has been improving, and his hematocrit has increased to 29 after receiving 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is improving, with a creatinine level trending down from 2.2 on admission to 1.4. The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to stress dose steroids and tube feeds, so tight glycemic control is advised.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent
   admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting
   with respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure: RSBI 77 this morning.  Question pneumonia versus
   aspiration event.  Significant sputum at NH per report with improved O2
   saturation after suctioning.  Here with diffuse rhonchi and increased
   work of breathing on presentation necessitating intubation on
   admission.  CXR was unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left
   shift, and exam findings concerning for pneumonia.  Pre-intubation ABG
   was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  Unlikely to be PE
   given improvement of O2 saturation on suctioning.
   - Extubate today
   - Continue empiric coverage for pneumonia with zosyn/vancomycin
   - Sputum culture with 1+ GPC on gram stain but culture only yeast;
   urinary Legionella Ag negative
   - Blood cultures no growth to date
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but likely due to sepsis.  Initially on
   levophed and vasopressin on admission . Levophed weaned off yesterday.
   - Discontinue vasopressin today
   - Change stress-dose steroids to home prednisone 10 mg daily
   # Anemia: Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on
   [**2105-11-6**].  Recent admission for GI bleed from duodenal ulcers.  History
   of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis labs unremarkable.
   Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of PRBC.  Hematocrit drifting down
   slowly, likely dilutional due to IVF.
   - Trend HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - Change stress-dose steroids to home prednisone 10 mg daily
   - Continue danazol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # ARF:Improving.  Cr 2.2 on admission to MICU from 1.2 on discharge
   [**2105-11-6**]. BUN also elevated to 37. Prerenal with Cr trending down to
   1.4 with IVF resuscitation.
   - NS 500 cc today and monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications
   # Hyperglycemia: In setting of stress dose steroids and tube feeds.
   - Tighten HISS
   - Discontinue TF as patient to be extubated
   # Hematuria: In setting of traumatic Foley placement.
   - Monitor
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved.  Due to renal failure.
   # Elevated troponin: Trended down.  Likely due to acute renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer, presenting with respiratory failure. He has been intubated due to increased work of breathing and diffuse rhonchi on examination. His pre-intubation ABG was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis. He also has hypotension likely due to sepsis, anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), hyperglycemia, and traumatic Foley placement. His metabolic acidosis has resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia vs aspiration event: The patient's presentation with respiratory failure and significant sputum production raises concern for either pneumonia or aspiration. The diffuse rhonchi and improvement of O2 saturation after suctioning suggest pneumonia as a possible complication.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis with a left shift indicate potential sepsis. The source of infection could be related to pneumonia or another underlying cause.
3. ARF: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal causes, intrinsic renal injury, or post-renal obstruction.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient is at risk for hyperglycemia due to stress-dose steroids and tube feeds. Tight glycemic control should be maintained to prevent complications associated with high blood sugar levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of HTN, hemolytic anemia, here with
   respiratory difficulty, intubated.
   # Respiratory distress: significant sputum at NH per report with
   improved O2 sat after suctioning. Here with diffuse rhonchi, increased
   work of breathing on presentation, necessitating intubation. CXR was
   unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left shift, and exam
   findings are concerning for pneumonia, ?aspiration. Pre-intubation ABG
   was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis. Given improvement of
   O2 saturation on suctioning, unlikely to be PE. Urinary Legionella Ag
   negative.
   - continue empiric vanco and pip-tazo for now
readjusted for improved
   renal function
   - sputum cx
   - blood cx
   - continue in CPAP ventilation, if mental status improves can consider
   extubation
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   - monitor fever curve, trend WBC
   - sedation and analgesia prn for comfort
   # Hypotension: started levophed and vasopressin. Levophed weaned off
   -- vasopressin for 24 more hr, then attempt to stop
   # Anemia: Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on
   [**2105-11-6**]. History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia. Tbili 2.3, down
   from last admission; hemolysis labs unremarkable. Hct increased to 29
   after 3 units of pRBCs.
   - trend Hct - stable
   - continue steroids (now hydrocort)
 wean hydrocort to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - danazol 400 [**Hospital1 **] for now
   # ARF:Improving.  Cr 2.2 on admission to MICU from 1.2 on discharge on
   [**2105-11-6**]. BUN also elevated to 37. Likely prerenal azotemia. Cr trended
   down to 1.4 with IVF resuscitation.
   - IVF prn
   - Renally dose meds
   - Check urine lytes to see if component of ATN given persistent low UOP
   and recent hypotension
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved.  Likely due to renal failure. Check
   lytes [**Hospital1 **], consider giving bicarb if planning extubation b/b low bicarb
   -- Trend, anticipate resolution
   # Hyperglycemia: In setting of stress dose steroids.
   - HISS
   # Duodenal ulcers: H. pylori serology negative.
   - discontinued clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   # Elevated troponin: Likely elevated troponin in setting of ARF.  Trop
   T 0.09 on presentation, CK 64, ECG with <1mm lateral ST depressions in
   V4 only. Trop 0.07 this morning.
   - repeat ECG stable yesterday

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and respiratory difficulty. He presented with respiratory distress, sputum production, diffuse rhonchi, and increased work of breathing. He was intubated and diagnosed with pneumonia, possibly aspiration. His pre-intubation ABG showed acute respiratory alkalosis, and urinary Legionella Ag was negative. The patient's hypotension was treated with levophed and vasopressin, and his anemia (hematocrit 23.4 on admission) was managed with blood transfusion and steroids. He also has acute renal failure with improving creatinine levels. Other issues include metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, duodenal ulcers, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation with respiratory distress, sputum production, and rhonchi suggests pneumonia, which can progress to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: Pneumonia can lead to sepsis, especially considering the fever and leukocytosis with left shift observed in the patient.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal impairment, which can be exacerbated by factors such as hypotension and pneumonia.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various interventions and treatments. The patient's medical history includes sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), altered mental status (not delirium), and prostatic hypertrophy.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters, such as SpO2 levels and respiratory rate, to ensure adequate gas exchange.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and laboratory parameters (e.g., white blood cell count) is necessary to detect any signs of infection or worsening sepsis.

3. Organ Dysfunction: Due to the patient's sepsis, there is a risk of organ dysfunction. Regular assessment of organ-specific functions (e.g., renal function, liver function) and close monitoring of relevant laboratory parameters are essential.

4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although the patient's respiratory failure is not classified as ARDS, it is important to monitor for any signs or symptoms suggestive of ARDS development, such as worsening"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 103/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,534 mL and output of 375 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood work indicates elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's troponin T level is within normal range. The patient has been prescribed vasopressin, piperacillin/tazobactam, pantoprazole, midazolam, and heparin. The patient's mental status is altered, and they are not consistently responding to commands. The respiratory failure has been resolved, and plans are being made to extubate the patient today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis-related organ failure: The patient's organ dysfunction indicates a risk of further deterioration and potential failure of other organs.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections due to prolonged intubation and immobility.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's low urine output and fluid"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint and history of present illness are not specified in the note. However, the patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. They are currently on vasopressin infusion and receiving IV fluids as needed. The goal is to discontinue vasopressin today.

The patient also has acute respiratory failure, which has now resolved. However, the patient remains somewhat somnolent and may require extubation today. It is mentioned that the patient does not follow commands clearly and there is an altered mental status. Sedation is planned to be discontinued today.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but they have bradycardia with a heart rate of 57 bpm. Blood pressure is low at 103/53 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is at 96%.

The patient's extremities are warm and edematous. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 329 K/uL and a decreased platelet count (Plt) of 82. The creatinine level is elevated at 1.4 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes and blood glucose levels, are also abnormal.

The patient's plan includes monitoring urine output, discontinuing sedation today, and considering extubation today. Further plans"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent
   admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting
   with respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure: RSBI 80 this morning
planned on extubation
   yesterday but held off due to low SBPs.  Question pneumonia versus
   aspiration event.  Significant sputum at NH per report with improved O2
   saturation after suctioning.  Here with diffuse rhonchi and increased
   work of breathing on presentation necessitating intubation on
   admission.  CXR was unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left
   shift, and exam findings concerning for pneumonia.  Pre-intubation ABG
   was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  Unlikely to be PE
   given improvement of O2 saturation on suctioning.
   - Extubate today
   - Continue empiric coverage for pneumonia with zosyn/vancomycin to
   complete a 7-day course
   - Sputum culture with 1+ GPC on gram stain but culture only yeast;
   urinary Legionella Ag negative
   - Blood cultures no growth to date
   # Hypotension: Improved.  Unclear etiology but presumed due to sepsis.
   Levophed off x 24 hours and vasopressin off since yesterday afternoon.
   SBP 80s initially off vasopressin but good response to fluids.
   Stress-dose steroids discontinued yesterday for home prednisone dose.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   # Acute renal failure: Stable.  Cr 2.2 on admission to MICU from 1.2 on
   discharge [**2105-11-6**]. BUN also elevated to 37. Was prerenal with Cr
   trending down to 1.4 with IVF resuscitation
 consider now ATN versus
   new baseline.
   - Continue IVF and monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications
   # Anemia: Stable.  Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from
   hospital on [**2105-11-6**].  Recent admission with GI bleed from duodenal
   ulcers.  History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis
   labs unremarkable.  Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of PRBC.
   - Trend HCT daily
   - Continue home prednisone 10 mg daily for hemolytic anemia
   - Continue danazol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for hemolytic anemia
   # Hyperglycemia: Improved off stress dose steroids and tube feeds.
   - Continue HISS and monitor
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved.  Due to renal failure.
   # Elevated troponin: Trended down.  No EKG changes.  Likely due to
   acute renal failure.  Troponin T 0.09 on presentation with CK 64.  ECG
   with < 1mm lateral ST depressions in V4 only.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis, and GI bleed from a duodenal ulcer. He presented with respiratory failure and required intubation on admission. The initial chest X-ray was unremarkable, but he had fever, leukocytosis with a left shift, and exam findings concerning for pneumonia. His pre-intubation ABG showed acute respiratory alkalosis. It is unlikely to be PE given the improvement in O2 saturation after suctioning.

The patient's blood pressure has improved, and vasopressin has been discontinued since yesterday afternoon. His serum creatinine has trended down from 2.2 on admission to 1.4 with IVF resuscitation, indicating stable acute renal failure. He also has anemia, which is stable, and hyperglycemia, both of which are being monitored and managed accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms and lab findings consistent with pneumonia. If not treated appropriately, it can worsen his respiratory status and potentially lead to septic shock.

2. Aspiration: Given the patient's increased work of breathing and significant sputum production, there is a risk of aspiration, especially during extubation. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure.

3. Renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels were elevated on admission, indicating pre-existing renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent
   admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting
   with respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure: RSBI 80 this morning
planned on extubation
   yesterday but held off due to low SBPs.  Question pneumonia versus
   aspiration event.  Significant sputum at NH per report with improved O2
   saturation after suctioning.  Here with diffuse rhonchi and increased
   work of breathing on presentation necessitating intubation on
   admission.  CXR was unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left
   shift, and exam findings concerning for pneumonia.  Pre-intubation ABG
   was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  Unlikely to be PE
   given improvement of O2 saturation on suctioning.
   - Extubate today
   - Continue empiric coverage for pneumonia with zosyn/vancomycin to
   complete a 7-day course
   - Sputum culture with 1+ GPC on gram stain but culture only yeast;
   urinary Legionella Ag negative
   - Blood cultures no growth to date
   # Hypotension: Improved.  Unclear etiology but presumed due to sepsis.
   Levophed off x 24 hours and vasopressin off since yesterday afternoon.
   SBP 80s initially off vasopressin but good response to fluids.
   Stress-dose steroids discontinued yesterday for home prednisone dose.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   # Acute renal failure: Stable.  Cr 2.2 on admission to MICU from 1.2 on
   discharge [**2105-11-6**]. BUN also elevated to 37. Was prerenal with Cr
   trending down to 1.4 with IVF resuscitation
 consider now ATN versus
   new baseline.
   - Continue IVF and monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications
   # Anemia: Stable.  Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from
   hospital on [**2105-11-6**].  Recent admission with GI bleed from duodenal
   ulcers.  History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis
   labs unremarkable.  Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of PRBC.
   - Trend HCT daily
   - Continue home prednisone 10 mg daily for hemolytic anemia
   - Continue danazol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for hemolytic anemia
   # Hyperglycemia: Improved off stress dose steroids and tube feeds.
   - Continue HISS and monitor
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved.  Due to renal failure.
   # Elevated troponin: Trended down.  No EKG changes.  Likely due to
   acute renal failure.  Troponin T 0.09 on presentation with CK 64.  ECG
   with < 1mm lateral ST depressions in V4 only.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting with respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but there are concerns about pneumonia versus aspiration event. The patient has diffuse rhonchi and increased work of breathing, indicating a possible infection in the lungs. The chest X-ray was unremarkable, but the patient has fever, leukocytosis with left shift, and exam findings concerning for pneumonia.

The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, with an SBP in the 80s. The hypotension is presumed to be due to sepsis, and the patient has been responding well to fluids. Vasopressin and Levophed have been discontinued.

The patient's renal function is stable, with a creatinine level of 2.2 on admission to the MICU from 1.2 on discharge. The BUN is also elevated at 37, which was prerenal with Cr trending down to 1.4 with IVF resuscitation. There is a consideration of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) versus new baseline renal function.

The patient's anemia is stable, with a Hct of 23.4 on admission and 24.7 on discharge from the hospital on [**2105-11-6**]. The patient has a history of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis labs unremarkable. The Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of PRBC. The patient will continue on home prednisone 10 mg daily for hemolytic anemia and danazol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for hemolytic anemia.

The patient's hyperglycemia has improved off stress dose steroids and tube feeds. The patient will continue on HISS and monitor.

The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved due to renal failure. The elevated troponin has trended down and is likely due to acute renal failure. The patient's troponin T level is 0.09 on presentation with CK 64. The ECG shows < 1mm lateral ST depressions in V4 only.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers are being managed appropriately. Oral care is planned to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's code status is full, and his disposition is pending extubation."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent
   admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting
   with respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure: RSBI 80 this morning
planned on extubation
   yesterday but held off due to low SBPs.  Moderate thick secretions at
   times.  Question pneumonia versus pneumonitis/aspiration event.  CXR
   was unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left shift, and exam
   findings concerning for pneumonia.  Pre-intubation ABG was consistent
   with acute respiratory alkalosis.  Unlikely to be PE given improvement
   of O2 saturation on suctioning.
   - SBT today, recheck ABG, and extubation if stable and less secretions
   - Continue empiric coverage for pneumonia with zosyn/vancomycin to
   complete a 7-day course
   - Sputum culture with 1+ GPC on gram stain but culture only yeast;
   urinary Legionella Ag negative
   - Blood cultures no growth to date
   # Hypotension: Improved.  Unclear etiology but presumed due to sepsis.
   Levophed off x 24 hours and vasopressin off since yesterday afternoon.
   SBP 80s initially off vasopressin but good response to fluids.
   Stress-dose steroids discontinued yesterday for home prednisone dose.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   # Acute renal failure: Stable.  Cr 2.2 on admission to MICU from 1.2 on
   discharge [**2105-11-6**].  Was prerenal with Cr trending down to 1.4 with IVF
   resuscitation
 consider now ATN versus new baseline.
   - Recheck urine electrolytes
   - Renally dose medications
   # Anemia: Stable.  Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from
   hospital on [**2105-11-6**].  Recent admission with GI bleed from duodenal
   ulcers.  History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis
   labs unremarkable.  Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of PRBC.
   - Trend HCT daily
   - Continue home prednisone 10 mg daily for hemolytic anemia
   - Continue danazol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for hemolytic anemia
   # Hyperglycemia: Improved off stress dose steroids and tube feeds.
   - Continue HISS and monitor
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved.  Due to renal failure.
   # Elevated troponin: Trended down.  Likely due to acute renal failure
   and not NSTEMI.  Troponin T 0.09 on presentation with CK 64.  ECG with
   < 1mm lateral ST depressions in V4 only.
   # BPH: Status post TURP in the past.  Traumatic Foley placement this
   admission.
   - Discontinue oxybutynin

","The patient is a 91-year-old male with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer, presenting with respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU and has multiple medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There are moderate thick secretions at times, and there is a concern for pneumonia versus pneumonitis/aspiration event. The chest X-ray is unremarkable, but the patient has fever, leukocytosis with left shift, and exam findings concerning for pneumonia. Pre-intubation ABG was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis. It is unlikely to be PE given improvement of O2 saturation on suctioning. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today, recheck ABG, and extubate if stable and less secretions. Empiric coverage for pneumonia with zosyn/vancomycin will be continued to complete a 7-day course. Sputum culture shows 1+ GPC on gram stain but culture only yeast; urinary Legionella Ag negative. Blood cultures no growth to date.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved. The etiology is unclear but presumed due to sepsis. Levophed has been off for 24 hours, and vasopressin has been off since yesterday afternoon. SBP 80s initially off vas"

   # Respiratory failure: RSBI 77 this morning.  Question pneumonia versus
   aspiration event.  Significant sputum at NH per report with improved O2
   saturation after suctioning.  Here with diffuse rhonchi and increased
   work of breathing on presentation necessitating intubation on
   admission.  CXR was unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left
   shift, and exam findings concerning for pneumonia.  Pre-intubation ABG
   was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  Unlikely to be PE
   given improvement of O2 saturation on suctioning.
   - Extubate today
   - Continue empiric coverage for pneumonia with zosyn/vancomycin
   - Sputum culture with 1+ GPC on gram stain but culture only yeast;
   urinary Legionella Ag negative
   - Blood cultures no growth to date
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but likely due to sepsis.  Initially on
   levophed and vasopressin on admission . Levophed weaned off yesterday.
   - Discontinue vasopressin today
   - Change stress-dose steroids to home prednisone 10 mg daily
   # ARF:Improving.  Cr 2.2 on admission to MICU from 1.2 on discharge
   [**2105-11-6**]. BUN also elevated to 37. Prerenal with Cr trending down to
   1.4 with IVF resuscitation.
   - NS 500 cc today and monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications
   # Anemia: Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on
   [**2105-11-6**].  Recent admission for GI bleed from duodenal ulcers.  History
   of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis labs unremarkable.
   Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of PRBC.  Hematocrit drifting down
   slowly, likely dilutional due to IVF.
   - Trend HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - Change stress-dose steroids to home prednisone 10 mg daily
   - Continue danazol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia: In setting of stress dose steroids and tube feeds.
   - Tighten HISS
   - Discontinue TF as patient to be extubated
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved.  Due to renal failure.
   # Elevated troponin: Trended down.  Likely due to acute renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent
   admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting
   with respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure: RSBI 77 this morning.  Question pneumonia versus
   aspiration event.  Significant sputum at NH per report with improved O2
   saturation after suctioning.  Here with diffuse rhonchi and increased
   work of breathing on presentation necessitating intubation on
   admission.  CXR was unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left
   shift, and exam findings concerning for pneumonia.  Pre-intubation ABG
   was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  Unlikely to be PE
   given improvement of O2 saturation on suctioning.
   - Extubate today
   - Continue empiric coverage for pneumonia with zosyn/vancomycin
   - Sputum culture with 1+ GPC on gram stain but culture only yeast;
   urinary Legionella Ag negative
   - Blood cultures no growth to date
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but presumed due to sepsis.  Initially
   on levophed and vasopressin on admission . Levophed weaned off
   yesterday.
   - Discontinue vasopressin today
   - Change stress-dose steroids to home prednisone 10 mg daily
   # ARF:Stable.  Cr 2.2 on admission to MICU from 1.2 on discharge
   [**2105-11-6**]. BUN also elevated to 37. Prerenal with Cr trending down to
   1.4 with IVF resuscitation
   - Continue IVF and monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications
   # Anemia: Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on
   [**2105-11-6**].  Recent admission for GI bleed from duodenal ulcers.  History
   of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis labs unremarkable.
   Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of PRBC.  Hematocrit drifting down
   slowly, likely dilutional due to IVF.
   - Trend HCT daily
   - Continue home prednisone 10 mg daily
   - Continue danazol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia: In setting of stress dose steroids and tube feeds.
   - Tighten HISS
   - Discontinue TF as patient to be extubated
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved.  Due to renal failure.
   # Elevated troponin: Trended down.  Likely due to acute renal failure.
   Troponin T 0.09 on presentation with CK 64.  ECG with < 1mm lateral ST
   depressions in V4 only.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and gastrointestinal bleeding from a duodenal ulcer, presenting with respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is characterized by low respiratory system compliance (RSBI) this morning, indicating potential pneumonia or aspiration event. The patient has diffuse rhonchi and increased work of breathing on presentation, necessitating intubation on admission. Chest X-ray is unremarkable, but the patient has fever, leukocytosis with a left shift, and exam findings concerning for pneumonia. Pre-intubation arterial blood gas (ABG) shows acute respiratory alkalosis.

The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology but presumed due to sepsis. Initially, the patient was on levophed and vasopressin on admission. Levophed was weaned off yesterday, and vasopressin is to be discontinued today. The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with stable condition. Creatinine (Cr) is 2.2 on admission to the MICU from 1.2 on discharge on [**2105-11-6**]. BUN is also elevated to 37. Prerenal with Cr trending down to 1.4 with intravenous fluids (IVF) resuscitation.

The patient's anemia is characterized by a hematocrit (Hct) of 23.4 on admission and 24.7 on discharge from the hospital on [**2105-11-6**]. The patient has a history of Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis labs unremarkable. Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Hematocrit is drifting down slowly, likely dilutional due to IVF.

The patient's hyperglycemia is in the setting of stress dose steroids and tube feeds. Tight glycemic control is recommended, and tube feeds should be discontinued as the patient is to be extubated.

The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, likely due to renal failure. Elevated troponin is trending down, likely due to acute renal failure. Troponin T is 0.09 on presentation with creatine kinase (CK) 64. ECG shows less than 1mm lateral ST depressions in V4 only.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's respiratory failure indicates a risk of pneumonia or aspiration event. The patient's hypotension could lead to septic shock. The presence of acute renal failure increases the risk of further complications such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances. The patient's anemia may require further management, including transfusions or evaluation of underlying causes. Hyperglycemia should be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications related to poor glycemic control. Finally, the patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, but careful monitoring is still necessary to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer, presenting with respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to either pneumonia or pneumonitis. There are concerns about secretions, but he has a good cough, so extubation may be considered. It is important to continue monitoring his respiratory status and provide appropriate respiratory support if needed.
2. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension of unclear etiology, presumed due to sepsis. He is off pressors now, but close monitoring of his blood pressure is necessary. Fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring of urine output are recommended.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has deteriorated from Cr 1.2 on discharge to MICU to Cr 2.2 on admission. BUN is also elevated to 37. This could be due to prerenal causes such as sepsis or intrinsic renal injury. Close monitoring of renal function and continuing IVF resuscitation with careful monitoring of urine output are essential.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which requires close monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. His current medications include home prednisone and danazol. Further evaluation and management"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent
   admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting
   with respiratory failure
   # Respiratory failure: RSBI 77 this morning.  Question pneumonia versus
   aspiration event.  Significant sputum at NH per report with improved O2
   saturation after suctioning.  Here with diffuse rhonchi and increased
   work of breathing on presentation necessitating intubation on
   admission.  CXR was unremarkable, but fever, leukocytosis with left
   shift, and exam findings concerning for pneumonia.  Pre-intubation ABG
   was consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis.  Unlikely to be PE
   given improvement of O2 saturation on suctioning.
   - Extubate today
   - Continue empiric coverage for pneumonia with zosyn/vancomycin
   - Sputum culture with 1+ GPC on gram stain but culture only yeast;
   urinary Legionella Ag negative
   - Blood cultures no growth to date
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology but presumed due to sepsis.  Initially
   on levophed and vasopressin on admission . Levophed weaned off
   yesterday.
   - Discontinue vasopressin today
   - Change stress-dose steroids to home prednisone 10 mg daily
   # ARF:Stable.  Cr 2.2 on admission to MICU from 1.2 on discharge
   [**2105-11-6**]. BUN also elevated to 37. Prerenal with Cr trending down to
   1.4 with IVF resuscitation
   - Continue IVF and monitor UOP
   - Renally dose medications
   # Anemia: Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from hospital on
   [**2105-11-6**].  Recent admission for GI bleed from duodenal ulcers.  History
   of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis labs unremarkable.
   Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of PRBC.  Hematocrit drifting down
   slowly, likely dilutional due to IVF.
   - Trend HCT daily
   - Continue home prednisone 10 mg daily
   - Continue danazol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia: In setting of stress dose steroids and tube feeds.
   - Tighten HISS
   - Discontinue TF as patient to be extubated
   # Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved.  Due to renal failure.
   # Elevated troponin: Trended down.  Likely due to acute renal failure.
   Troponin T 0.09 on presentation with CK 64.  ECG with < 1mm lateral ST
   depressions in V4 only.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting with respiratory failure. He has been in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a low respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) indicating respiratory failure. He has been intubated due to diffuse rhonchi and increased work of breathing. There is concern for pneumonia versus aspiration event. The patient's sputum culture shows 1+ gram-positive cocci but only yeast, and urinary Legionella antigen is negative. Blood cultures have no growth to date.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the etiology is unclear but presumed due to sepsis. Initially, he was on levophed and vasopressin but has since had levophed weaned off. Vasopressin is to be discontinued today, and stress-dose steroids are being changed to home prednisone 10 mg daily.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level was elevated on admission to the MICU from 1.2 on discharge. BUN is also elevated at 37. The ARF is prerenal with Cr trending down to 1.4 with IVF resuscitation. The plan is to continue IVF and monitor urine output, renally dose medications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and gastrointestinal bleeding from a duodenal ulcer. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, anemia, and hyperglycemia. The patient's respiratory failure is suspected to be caused by pneumonia or pneumonitis, as indicated by the presence of thick secretions and positive Gram-positive cocci (GPC) in pairs/chains in the sputum culture. The hypotension is presumed to be due to sepsis, and the patient has shown improvement after being taken off levophed and vasopressin. Acute renal failure was initially prerenal but has now progressed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), as evidenced by the urine electrolytes. The patient's anemia is stable, with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 24.7 on discharge from the hospital. Hyperglycemia has improved off stress dose steroids and tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if pneumonia or pneumonitis is not effectively treated. Inadequate oxygenation or ventilation may lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypotension: Despite improvement, the patient's hypotension could recur if sepsis is not adequately managed. Persistent"

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and gastrointestinal bleeding from a duodenal ulcer presenting with respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The initial plan was to extubate the patient yesterday but was held due to moderate thick secretions. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) was performed today, and the patient's ABG results showed pH 7.47, PaCO2 29, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 247, indicating improvement in gas exchange. The patient's blood cultures have shown no growth to date.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still on mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia versus pneumonitis. The presence of thick secretions and positive gram-positive cocci (GPC) on sputum gram stain suggests an ongoing infection. The patient will undergo another SBT, and if stable with less secretions, extubation may be considered. Empiric coverage for pneumonia with Zosyn/Vancomycin will be continued for a total of 7 days. The sputum culture showed yeast but no bacterial growth, and urinary Legionella antigen was negative.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved, but the exact cause of hypotension remains unclear. It is presumed due to sepsis"

   [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent
   admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting
   with respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia versus pneumonitis.  RSBI 53 this
   morning
planned on extubation yesterday but held due to moderate thick
   secretions.  Now little/no secretions.  Repeat sputum yesterday with 2+
   GPC in pairs/chains present previously.
   - Extubate today
   - Continue empiric coverage for pneumonia with zosyn/vancomycin to
   complete a 7-day course
   - Sputum culture with 1+ GPC on gram stain but culture only yeast;
   urinary Legionella Ag negative
   - Blood cultures no growth to date
   # Hypotension: Improved.  Unclear etiology but presumed due to sepsis.
   Off levophed x 48 hours and vasopressin over 24 hours.  Initially on
   stress-dose steroids but now on home prednisone dose for over 48 hours.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   # Acute renal failure: Improving.  Cr 2.2 on admission from baseline
   1.2.  Was prerenal with Cr trending down to 1.4 with IVF resuscitation
 now urine electrolytes consistent with ATN.
   - Monitor
   - Renally dose medications
   # Leukocytosis: Mild.  Patient remains afebrile.
   - Treatment for pneumonia as above
   - Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Patient responding appropriately to commands
   this morning.
   - Will monitor off sedation
   # Anemia: Stable.  Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from
   hospital on [**2105-11-6**].  Recent admission with GI bleed from duodenal
   ulcers.  History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis
   labs unremarkable.  Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of PRBC.
   - Trend HCT daily
   - Continue home prednisone 10 mg daily for hemolytic anemia
   - Continue danazol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for hemolytic anemia
   # Hyperglycemia: Improved off stress dose steroids and tube feeds.
   - Continue HISS and monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting with respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with decreased secretions and an RSBI of 53. The plan is to extubate the patient today. He is being treated empirically for pneumonia with zosyn/vancomycin. Blood cultures show no growth to date, and sputum culture only shows yeast.

The patient's blood pressure has improved, and he is off vasopressor support. He was on stress-dose steroids but is now on home prednisone dose. The acute renal failure is improving, with a creatinine level of 2.2 on admission decreasing to 1.4 with IVF resuscitation. The patient has mild leukocytosis and altered mental status, but he is responding appropriately to commands. Anemia is stable, and hyperglycemia has improved off stress-dose steroids and tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia versus pneumonitis: The patient presents with respiratory failure, and there is a concern for either pneumonia or pneumonitis. The sputum culture shows yeast but no bacterial growth, and the urinary Legionella Ag is negative.
2. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan, written by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   [**Location (un) 2599**]. I would emphasize and add the following points: [**Age over 90 **]M respiratory
   failure, volume overload, hemolytic anemia, duodenal ulcers.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.9 BP 120/70 HR 80 RR 18 with sat 95 on PSV 5/5

   Soft, NT, 3+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 12K, HCT 28, K+ 3.9, Cr 1.3.
   Agree with plan to continue empiric treatment for pneumonia and
   extubate today as his acute respiratory failure in improving and
   secretions have decreased in volume. Will monitor post extubation and
   consider gentle diuresis. Can d/c CVL once extubated. Remainder of plan
   as outlined above.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of hemolytic anemia, HTN, recent
   admissions for pancreatitis and GI bleed from duodenal ulcer presenting
   with respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory failure: Pneumonia versus pneumonitis.  Intubated 4 days
   then extubated. Currently doing weel with little to no secretions.
   Repeat sputum yesterday with 2+ GPC in pairs/chains present previously,
   but no speciation. Urinary legionella was negative
   - Continue empiric coverage for pneumonia with zosyn/vancomycin to
   complete a 7-day course, last day [**11-20**]
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Blood cultures no growth to date
   - Wean off O2
   # Hypotension: Improved.  Unclear etiology but presumed due to sepsis.
   Off levophed > 48 hours and vasopressin > 24 hours.  Initially on
   stress-dose steroids but now on home prednisone dose for over 48 hours.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   # Acute renal failure: Improving.  Cr 2.2 on admission from baseline
   1.2.  Creatinine improving, urine lytes consistent with ATN. Cr 1.3
   today. UOP low, give 500 ml NS bolus to see if UOP increases.
   - Monitor
   - Renally dose medications
   # Leukocytosis: Persistant, patient improving and afebrile.
   - Treatment for pneumonia as above
   - Monitor
   # Altered mental status: Patient responding appropriately to commands
   this morning.
   - Baseline
   # Anemia: Stable.  Hct 23.4 on admission, 24.7 on discharge from
   hospital on [**2105-11-6**].  Recent admission with GI bleed from duodenal
   ulcers.  History of Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with hemolysis
   labs unremarkable.  Hct increased to 29 after 3 units of PRBC.
   - Trend HCT daily
   - Continue home prednisone 10 mg daily for hemolytic anemia
   - Continue danazol 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for hemolytic anemia
   # Hyperglycemia: Improved off stress dose steroids and tube feeds.
   Resolved, but patient not eating

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of hemolytic anemia, hypertension, recent admissions for pancreatitis and gastrointestinal bleed from duodenal ulcer, presenting with respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated for 4 days and is now extubated.

The patient's current condition shows improvement, with little to no secretions. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure and was intubated. Although he is now extubated, there is a possibility of pneumonia versus pneumonitis. The patient is still on empiric coverage for pneumonia with Zosyn/Vancomycin, and sputum cultures are being followed.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which improved but the etiology is unclear. It was presumed due to sepsis. The patient was off levophed >48 hours and vasopressin >24 hours. Stress-dose steroids were initially given but now the patient is on home prednisone dose for over 48 hours. Continuing antibiotics is advised.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.2 on admission from a baseline of 1.2. Creatinine is improving, and urine electrolytes are consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). A 500 ml NS bolus was given"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia. He has been extubated and is currently weaning off supplemental oxygen. The patient has a history of allergies to Darvon and unknown allergies. His code status is DNR/DNI. The patient has been receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/51 to 157/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient was previously intubated and is now being weaned off supplemental oxygen, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should monitor for symptoms such as fever, increased respiratory rate, and production of purulent secretions.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures such as wearing compression boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is important.
