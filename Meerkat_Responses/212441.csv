   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3383**] is an 84 year old female with CAD, AS, diastolic CHF
   admitted with a worsening shortness of breath.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] with pneumonia,
   treated with levaquin and 14 day course of vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   completed on [**9-18**].  Now with leukocytosis, though denies fevers or
   chills.  Concern for pneumonia (hospital acquired given that she was at
   rehab and recently discharged).  Although increasing O2 requirements
   may be due to patient's inability to clear secretions due to weak
   cough/ deconditioning.  Has a history of PE, though currently with
   supratherapeutic INR.  Has history of diastolic heart failure with
   elevated BNP (though unknown baseline), elevated JVP, b/l LE edema
   (stable), and ""Mild CHF"" on CXR, which may be contributing to her SOB
   though did not tolerate diuresis in ED due to low BP.  Given
   leukocytosis, would favor treating pneumonia and then considering
   diuresis in a few days if she fails to respond.
   - continue albuterol, atrovent
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - frequent suctioning
   - consider diuresis if BP tolerates it
   - send sputum sample
   - PA and lateral CXR
   .
   2. A. fib.  Patient developed A. fib post-operatively after CABG on
   [**2138-7-29**] and has been treated with coumadin.  Now found to have
   supratherapeutic INR.  Currently in NSR.
   - continue amiodarone
   - hold coumadin given supratherapeutic INR
   - hold metoprolol for now given hypotension in ED
   .
   3.  CAD.  S/p CABG on [**2138-7-29**].  Initial set of cardiac enzymes showed
   normal CK and TropT of 0.05.  Not complaining of CP and EKG appears
   unchanged.
   - aspirin, simvastatin
   - hold lisinopril, metoprolol given hypotension in ED
   .
   4.       Hypotension.  Patient had hypotension to 70s overnight, after
   receiving lasix in ED.  From prior notes, appears to commonly have SBP
   of 100 or 110.  Given concern for pulmonary infection, will given fluid
   boluses to maintain SBP > 90.  Due to hypotension, unable to diurese
   patient.
   - fluid boluses to maintain SBP > 90
   5.       Sytolic murmur.  Patient with systolic murmur on exam.
   Recently had aortic valve replacement.  Echo following surgery showed
   1+ AR, and [**11-20**]+MR.
   - consider echo
   Ppx: therapeutic INR for A. fib, bowel regimen, home PPI

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AS), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was recently discharged from another hospital with pneumonia and completed a 14-day course of vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia. She presents with worsening shortness of breath and tachypnea. On examination, she has a systolic murmur, bilateral lower extremity edema, and rhonchi on chest auscultation. Laboratory findings show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.0 K/uL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated levels of potassium and phosphorus. Her INR is supratherapeutic, indicating potential anticoagulation issues. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (A. fib) post-operatively after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and is currently on amiodarone. She also has a history of CAD with recent CABG surgery, and her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. She experienced hypotension overnight and had a systolic murmur on examination. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status and is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and left pleural effusion, initially diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. She was discharged to rehabilitation but is now admitted to the ICU for difficulty breathing, multifocal pneumonia, and deep suctioning.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76 to 146 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. She is currently receiving IV fluids, and her fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,114 mL with outputs of 570 mL urine and 117 mL NG. She has an NG tube placed for feeding and deep suctioning.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (17.0 K/uL), low hemoglobin (9.5 g/dL), slightly elevated potassium (3.7 mEq/L), and elevated lactate levels (27 mg/dL). Other lab values, including creatinine, troponin T, and electrolytes, are within normal ranges.

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of atrial septal defect (ASD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and left pleural effusion. The patient was diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and was initially treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. However, she developed a new episode of pneumonia and now has a bilateral infiltrate suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 76/30 mmHg to 146/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi and secretions in the airways, no organomegaly, and trace lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine level. Other lab values, including liver function tests, electrolytes, and cardiac markers, are within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal a right pleural effusion and multifocal pneumonia with effusion.

   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive).
   Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC and concern for
   recurrent left sided effusion. Unclear whether this is an under treated
   MRSA PNA, new HCAP or new/chronic  aspiration event. An alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo)
   - Deep suction
   - Chest CT (non contrast)
   PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.
   - Hold coumadin for now (will reverse with FFP if needed) for possible
   thoracentesis
   Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG:  there may be an element of
   decompensated fuction here with increased BNP. She had received
   diuresis in the ED and became hypotensive.  We will re-evaluate her
   cardiac function with TTE, it may be that she requires a gentler
   approach (ie IV lasix drip) to effect good diuresis.
   - TTE
   - Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded)
   - Cont ASA
   Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone (can convert to IV as needed),
   currently in sinus so will defer therapy for now. If NG tube placed
   then restart amiodarone.
   Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her NPO
   for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her. In the mean time
   given the pooled secretions she will need an NG tube for feeding
   - NG tube

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe collapse, and was diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia. She was discharged to a rehabilitation center but was readmitted with increasing dyspnea on exertion and cough. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for recurrent left-sided pleural effusion, which may be due to aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent pneumonia: The patient has already had one episode of MRSA pneumonia and now presents with symptoms suggesting another respiratory infection. This could be due to aspiration or an untreated previous infection.
2. Aspiration event: The patient's weakness and inability to clear secretions put her at high risk for aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the patient is on therapeutic anticoagulation, she remains at high risk for recurrent PE.
4. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's history of CAD and previous CABG, along with diastolic dysfunction, may contribute to her current symptoms and need for cardiac evaluation.
5. Diuretic therapy complications: The patient's diuretic therapy may cause electrolyte"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe collapse, along with a left pleural effusion. She was initially diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia but now has a sputum culture growing both gram-negative rods (GNR) and MRSA. She also has an elevated white blood cell count.

The patient's current assessment includes pneumonia, possibly due to MRSA and GNR, as well as a left pleural effusion. The effusion could be attributed to post-CABG complications. The patient is at high risk for aspiration due to weakness and inability to clear secretions. Her white blood cell count has improved since starting therapy.

The plan of care includes broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for a minimum of 14 days. Deep suctioning is recommended to manage her secretions, and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line will be placed for IV medication administration.

Other issues mentioned in the note include:
- PE: The patient had a previous pulmonary embolism (PE) on [**2138-1-18**"

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname 3383**] and discussed her case with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 424**],
   whose note above reflects my input.  This 84-year-old woman with a
   complicated cardiac history has improved somewhat with therapy but is
   still tenuous requiring close respiratory management, suctioning, etc.
   Her CT is consistent with pneumonia; when compared with prior CT, the
   effusion is much smaller, suggesting that it does not represent
   infection.  We will continue to treat for nosocomial pneumonia and hold
   off on thoracentesis.  For her history of PE, we are trying to bring
   her INR down into the usual therapeutic range with vitamin K.  Given
   the current level and no current evidence of bleeding, guidelines do
   not recommend more active reversal.  Other issues as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 423**]
   note above.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on [**2138-7-29**]. She presented to the hospital on [**8-25**] with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, accompanied by a pleural effusion. She was initially diagnosed with suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) and discharged to rehab. However, she was readmitted from rehab with increasing dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and cough, along with imaging consistent with pneumonia and sputum cultures positive for Gram-negative rods (GNR) and MRSA.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has recent MRSA pneumonia, now with elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and positive sputum culture for MRSA and GNR. She appears at very high risk given her weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate. Broad coverage for MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes is recommended (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a minimum of 14-day course. Deep suctioning and placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line on [**9-29**] for IV antibiotic administration are also advised.

2. Pleural Effusion: The left-sided effusion has improved in size since starting therapy.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a past medical history of PE, thought to be immobilization-related. She remains at high risk for recurrent PE, but currently, her international normalized ratio (INR) is supra-therapeutic. Coumadin has been held, and vitamin K has been started to bring the INR down to the usual therapeutic range.

4. Diastolic Dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG: There may be an element of decompensated function with increased B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The patient received diuresis in the emergency department and became hypotensive. Further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned, and it may be reasonable to start low-dose lasix tomorrow ([**9-29**]).

5. Atrial Fibrillation: Amiodarone has been prescribed.

6. Swallowing: The patient is at very high risk for aspiration, so she has been made nil per os (NPO) for now until a speech-language pathologist (SLP) further evaluates her. A nasogastric (NG) tube has been placed, and repeat SLP is scheduled on [**9-29**].

Other issues are noted in the ICU resident's note."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She presented to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe collapse, which was initially thought to be due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. However, she was discharged on September 10th to rehab and now presents with increasing dyspnea on exertion and cough. Her current condition includes pneumonia, recurrent left-sided pleural effusion, and high risk for aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent left-sided pleural effusion: The patient has a history of MRSA pneumonia and now presents with elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible recurrence of the infection or new healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). There is also concern for a chronic aspiration event or post-CABG effusion.
2. Aspiration: Given the patient's weakness and inability to clear secretions, she is at a very high risk for aspiration. It is important to evaluate her swallowing ability and consider the placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube for feeding.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the patient had a previous PE, it is unclear whether this is a new event or the previous one. She remains at high risk for recurrent PE"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on [**2138-7-29**]. She presented to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe collapse, which was initially thought to be community-acquired MRSA pneumonia. She was discharged to a rehabilitation center but returned with increasing dyspnea on exertion and cough. Imaging revealed pneumonia, and sputum culture showed both gram-negative rods and MRSA. Her white blood cell count has improved since starting antibiotic therapy, and her left-sided pleural effusion has decreased in size.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia: Covering broad spectrum for MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes with Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam for a minimum of 14 days.
2. Pleural Effusion: Consider an alternative explanation as the previous transudative effusion may have been a post-CABG effusion.
3. Risk for Aspiration: High risk due to weakness and inability to clear secretions. NG tube placement and evaluation by a speech-language pathologist (SLP) are planned.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Supra-therapeutic INR for anticoagulation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, which was initially thought to be due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. She was discharged to a rehabilitation center but was readmitted due to increasing dyspnea on exertion and cough.

The patient's current assessment indicates recent MRSA pneumonia, now with an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and growth of Gram-negative rod (GNR) and MRSA on sputum culture. The left pleural effusion, initially thought to be MRSA pneumonia, is now considered a post-CABG effusion. The patient is at high risk for aspiration due to weakness and inability to clear secretions.

The plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a minimum of 14 days. Deep suctioning is also recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on [**2137-07-29**]. She presented to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe collapse, thought to be due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility but was readmitted due to increasing dyspnea on exertion and cough.

The patient's current assessment includes pneumonia, possibly caused by MRSA and Gram-negative bacilli (GNR), as indicated by sputum culture. She also has a left-sided pleural effusion, which is smaller in size compared to the previous episode. Her white blood cell count has improved since starting therapy.

The patient is at high risk for aspiration due to weakness and inability to clear secretions. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, for a minimum of 14 days.

The patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), for which she is currently on anticoagulation therapy. Her cardiac function may be decompensated, as evidenced by increased B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP"

She was discharged on [**9-10**] to a rehabilitation center, but was readmitted due to increasing dyspnea on exertion and cough. Imaging and sputum culture revealed pneumonia with both gram-negative rods (GNR) and MRSA. Her left-sided effusion has decreased in size since starting therapy.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has MRSA pneumonia, for which she is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Broad-spectrum coverage is necessary due to the presence of both MRSA and GNR in the sputum culture.
2. Pleural Effusion: The effusion appears to be a post-CABG effusion rather than infectious. It has shown improvement since starting pneumonia treatment.

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 3383**] is an 84 year old female with AS, CAD s/p CABG
   and AVR on [**2138-7-29**] presented to OSH in [**Month (only) 1148**] with SOB, with L pleural
   effusion recent admission for MRSA pneumonia now with worsening
   multifocal pneumonia (?recurrent aspiration) and ?decompensated CHF.
   1.   pneumonia.  Patient discharged last week for MRSA PNA.  Now with
   rising WBC and increasing secretions.  Respiratory status has improved
   with suctioning, vanco/zosyn.  Suspician for recurrent aspiration
   pneumonia.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - MRSA and GNR coverage with anaerobes
 dedicated 14d course, to end
   [**10-11**] - Vanco and Pip-Tazo
   - deep suction prn
   2.  History of PE.  Patient had PE in [**1-/2138**], thought [**12-21**]
   immobilization.  INR has been drifting down off coumadin.  Will restart
   coumadin in AM if INR < 3.0.
   - follow INR
   - consider resuming coumadin in AM
   3.  Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG.  There may be an element of
   decompensated fuction here with increased BNP. She had received
   diuresis in the ED and became hypotensive.  [**Month (only) 51**] ultimately need
   diuresis once lung disease stabilizes.
   - TTE today
   - hold beta blocker and lasix
   - cont asa
   4.       Atrial fibrillation.  Amiodarone.  Holding lopressor due to
   hypotension.  Anticoagulated with coumadin.
   - continue amiodarone
   - therapeutic inr
   - continue to hold lopressor
   5.  Swallowing. aspiration risk, will have her NPO for now until we can
   have SLP further evaluate her. In the mean time given the pooled
   secretions she will need an NG tube for feeding

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have left pleural effusion. She was recently admitted for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and now presents with worsening multifocal pneumonia, suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically MRSA pneumonia. She was previously discharged with a dedicated 14-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, but now her respiratory status has improved with suctioning, and she is being treated with vanco/zosyn. There is suspicion for recurrent aspiration pneumonia.

2. History of PE: The patient had a previous pulmonary embolism (PE) in [month/day/2138], thought to be due to immobilization. Her INR has been drifting down off coumadin, and it is planned to restart coumadin in the morning if the INR is less than 3.0. She will be followed closely with INR monitoring, and consideration will be given to resuming coumadin in the morning.

3. Diastolic Dysfunction/C"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and a previous CABG and AVR procedure. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have a left pleural effusion. She was diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and subsequently admitted to the ICU for further treatment. The patient has been experiencing difficulty clearing secretions due to a weak cough and has shown leukocytosis on lab results. Imaging revealed multifocal pneumonia with effusion. The patient's current medications include Vancomycin and Piperacillin-Tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, which may not have received adequate treatment duration. There is also a possibility of superimposed aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's difficulty in clearing secretions.

2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient was initially suspected of having a PE due to immobilization. However, her Coumadin levels are now supratherapeutic, indicating the need to hold the medication temporarily. A thoracentesis may be performed to further evaluate the situation.

3. Diastolic Dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG: The patient's diastolic dysfunction and history of CAD with CABG surgery suggest the possibility of decompensated cardiac function. She received diuretics in the ED, which resulted in hypotension. Further evaluation is needed, including a T"

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and previous cardiac surgeries including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have a left pleural effusion. She was initially treated for MRSA pneumonia but did not improve, and subsequent cultures showed growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs (suggestive of streptococci) and gram-negative rods. She was then started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for 14 days.

The patient's current condition includes multifocal pneumonia, deep suctioning requirements, and difficulty clearing secretions. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/31 to 134/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. She is in sinus rhythm and has a temperature of 36.8°C.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Her renal function is mildly impaired with a creatinine level of 1"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and left lung collapse, thought to be due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. She was discharged to rehabilitation but returned with increasing dyspnea on exertion and cough. Imaging is consistent with pneumonia, and sputum culture shows MRSA and gram-negative rods. The patient's recent course is complicated by the discovery of a high gradient across the AVR.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia: Cover broadly for MRSA, gram-negative rods, and anaerobes with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for a minimum of 14-day course. Start deep suction and PICC line for IV course.
2. PE: No further role for anticoagulation.
3. Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR: Consult cardiac surgery regarding further diagnostic testing.
4. Nose bleed: Continue to follow Hct, Plt, and INR. Seek ENT input and packing.
5. Atrial fibrillation: Administer amiodarone by NG tube.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe collapse, and was initially diagnosed with severe pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). She was discharged to rehabilitation but was readmitted due to increasing dyspnea on exertion and cough. Imaging showed pneumonia, and sputum culture revealed MRSA and Gram-negative rods (GNR). Her recent course has been complicated by the discovery of a high gradient across the AVR.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, which is a serious infection that can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes.

2. Aortic Valve Dysfunction: The patient's most recent TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) showed an increased gradient across the prosthetic aortic valve, indicating possible dysfunction. Further evaluation by cardiac surgery is recommended.

3. Mitral Regurgitation: The TTE also revealed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, which may be underestimated due to acoustic shadowing. This could contribute to heart failure symptoms."

   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive, imaging consistent with PNA  and sputum with GNR
   and MRSA PNA.
   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]
   - Deep suction
   - Will need PICC line [**9-29**] for IV course.
   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.
   - Hold coumadin for now
   - 2 days of Vit K starting [**9-28**] as she will likely need long term
   anti-coag
   >Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG:  there may be an element of
   decompensated fuction here with increased BNP. She had received
   diuresis in the ED and became hypotensive.  We will re-evaluate her
   cardiac function with TTE, it may be that she requires a gentler
   approach (ie IV lasix drip) to effect good diuresis as she has marked
   lower ext edema, however I think we can defer this until we see
   improvement in her infectious process.
   - TTE not done yet.
   - Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded). It may be reasonable to start low dose lasix tomorrow
   ([**9-29**])
   - Cont ASA
    Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone
   - Amiodarone by NG
    >Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her
   NPO (s/p NG tube)  for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on [**2138-7-29**]. She presented to the hospital on [**8-25**] with severe shortness of breath (SOB) and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, and was diagnosed with a left pleural effusion thought to be caused by [**12-21**] methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. She was discharged on [**9-10**] to a rehabilitation center and readmitted with increasing dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and cough. Imaging showed pneumonia, and her sputum culture revealed MRSA and Gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a recent history of MRSA pneumonia and current symptoms consistent with pneumonia. Broad coverage for MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes is recommended for a minimum of 14 days.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient's left-sided effusion has improved since starting therapy, but she remains at high risk for recurrent effusion due to weakness and inability to clear secretions. Close monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and left pleural effusion, and was admitted for MRSA pneumonia. She has been readmitted multiple times due to worsening multifocal pneumonia, suspected recurrent aspiration, and possible decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's current condition includes a significant nosebleed caused by recurrent nasal suctioning, for which she received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion, and packing was placed by the ENT team. She also has a high transaortic gradient across her prosthetic valve, as shown on an echocardiogram, and it is recommended to proceed with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including pneumonia, epistaxis (nosebleed), history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG, and atrial fibrillation. She is currently on a 14-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics to cover recurrent MRSA and Klebsiella infections. 

The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but she has slightly elevated white blood cell count and increasing"

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3383**], an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), presented to the hospital with shortness of breath. She was admitted recently for MRSA pneumonia and now presents with worsening multifocal pneumonia, suspected recurrent aspiration, and possibly decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's respiratory status has improved with suctioning and antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia due to suspected recurrent aspiration events.
2. Complications related to the prosthetic valve, such as prosthetic valve endocarditis or dysfunction.
3. Potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization.
4. Decompensated heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
5. Atrial fibrillation and the associated risks of thromboembolism and anticoagulation management.
6. Difficulty with swallowing and aspiration risk, which may require nutritional support through a nasogastric (NG) tube.
7. Possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. Stress ulcer prophylaxis due to prolonged ICU stay and immobilization.
9. Glycemic control issues due to nutritional support and stress response"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive, imaging consistent with PNA  and sputum with
   Klebsiella and MRSA PNA.. Her most recent course is complicated by the
   discovery of a high gradient across the AVR.
   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]
   - Deep suction
   - Will need PICC line [**9-29**] for IV course.
   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.  Her
   PE has a reversible risk factor and with her current bleeding we feel
   comfortable that she has received an adequate cours, also she has
   marked increase in ecchymosis and a nose bleed requiring ENT so we will
   no longer anti-coagulate
   - No further role for anti-coagulation (and does not require from a
   valvular standpoint)
   - Cont Vitamin K for one additional day
    >Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR:  Her clinical exam and
   increased BNP are  consistent with the findings of TTE which shows
   increased gradient across the valve. We will d/w cardiac surgery
   regarding further diagnostic testing given her overall conditioning she
   would seem to be a poor candidate if surgery were deemed necessary. We
   will attempt gentle diuresis with lasix gtt today and aim for net
   negative goal. I do not think she can tolerate a TEE for further
   evaluation given her degree of respiratory compromise.
   -- Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded).
   - Cont ASA
   > Nose bleed: [**12-21**] suction trauma, appreciate ENT input and packing.
   - Will cont to follow Hct, Plt and INR
   >Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone
   - Amiodarone by NG
   >Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her NPO
   (s/p NG tube)  for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her.
   - NG tube
   - tube feeds
   - Video swallow: cancel for now given over all poor prognosis.
   Other issues per ICU resident note.
   Addendum-
   After discussion with the family
 given the patient prognosis and
   wishes, the decision has been made to stop
   ICU Care

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe collapse, which was initially thought to be due to MRSA pneumonia. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility but was readmitted due to increasing dyspnea on exertion and cough. Imaging and sputum cultures revealed Klebsiella and MRSA pneumonia. The patient's recent course has been complicated by a high gradient across the AVR and the development of a left-sided pleural effusion. 

The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR, nose bleed, and swallowing difficulties. She is at high risk for recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE), but her PE has reversible risk factors and she is currently supra-therapeutic with anticoagulation. 

The plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes, deep suctioning of the left-sided pleural effusion, placement of a percutaneous central venous catheter (PICC line) for IV antibiotic therapy, and discontinuation of anticoagulation due to increased ecchymosis and a nose bleed. The patient will undergo gentle di"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on [**2138-7-29**]. She presented to the hospital on [**8-25**] with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe collapse, which was initially thought to be due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. She was discharged to rehabilitation but returned with increasing dyspnea on exertion and cough. Imaging showed pneumonia consistent with Klebsiella and MRSA, and her sputum culture also grew MRSA and gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient's recent course is complicated by the discovery of a high gradient across the AVR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, which is a serious infection that can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient initially presented with a left-sided pleural effusion, which could be due to the pneumonia or a post-CABG complication. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. High Gradient across AVR: The patient's recent course is complicated by a high gradient across the AVR, indicating possible diastolic dysfunction. This may require"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive, imaging consistent with PNA  and sputum with
   Klebsiella and MRSA PNA.. Her most recent course is complicated by the
   discovery of a high gradient across the AVR.
   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]
   - Deep suction
   - Will need PICC line [**9-29**] for IV course.
   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.  Her
   PE has a reversible risk factor and with her current bleeding we feel
   comfortable that she has received an adequate cours, also she has
   marked increase in ecchymosis and a nose bleed requiring ENT so we will
   no longer anti-coagulate
   - No further role for anti-coagulation (and does not require from a
   valvular standpoint)
   - Cont Vitamin K for one additional day
   >Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR:  Her clinical exam and
   increased BNP are  consistent with the findings of TTE which shows
   increased gradient across the valve. We will d/w cardiac surgery
   regarding further diagnostic testing
   -- Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded). It may be reasonable to start low dose lasix tomorrow
   ([**9-29**])
   - Cont ASA
   > Nose bleed: [**12-21**] suction trauma, appreciate ENT input and packing.
   - Will cont to follow Hct, Plt and INR

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3383**] is an 84 year old female with AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on
   [**2138-7-29**] presented to OSH in [**Month (only) 1148**] with SOB, with L pleural effusion
   recent admission for MRSA pneumonia now with worsening multifocal
   pneumonia (?recurrent aspiration) and ?decompensated CHF.
   #.   pneumonia.  Patient discharged a week PTA for MRSA PNA. Also
   suspician for recurrent aspiration pneumonia.  Thus far sputum cultures
   with MRSA and pansensitive klebsiella.
   - Will continue for 14 day course of vanc and zosyn to cover recurrent
   MRSA, the Klebsiella, and any other uncultured  organisms from
   recurrent aspiration.
   - speech and swallow when able (needs video study).
   # Hypoxia/respiratory distress.  Multifactorial.  Has MRSA pneumonia as
   above, likely also chronic aspiration.  Has difficulty clearing
   secretions due to muscular weakness; unable to effectively suction due
   to epistaxis.  Also with likely worsening CHF (intermittent hypotension

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia. She had an aortic valve replacement (AVR) on [2138-7-29] and is now admitted to the ICU for worsening multifocal pneumonia, suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia/respiratory distress, likely due to MRSA pneumonia, chronic aspiration, difficulty clearing secretions, worsening CHF, and a recent AVR with an increasing gradient across the valve. She also has epistaxis, which is likely related to recurrent nasogastric (NG) tube suctioning. Her coagulation status has been managed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K.

The patient has a history of aortic stenosis post AVR, recent AVR but with increased gradient, mild aortic regurgitation, and a previous pulmonary embolism (PE). Her cardiovascular status includes diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR tightness. She is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone. She is anticoagulated with coumadin but it has been held due to epist"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 3383] is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and left pleural effusion. She was recently admitted for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and now has worsening multifocal pneumonia, suspected recurrent aspiration, and possibly decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF).

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and is now presenting with worsening multifocal pneumonia. There is suspicion of recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
2. Epistaxis: The patient experienced nosebleeds, likely related to recurrent nasotracheal suctioning. Her INR was in the therapeutic range but was reversed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP). ENT consultation has been requested.
3. Aortic stenosis post AVR: The patient has increased gradient (doubled peak and mean) since the last echocardiogram. Mild aortic regurgitation is also present. CT surgery has been notified, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be necessary, possibly requiring intubation.
4. History of pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient had a PE in the past, thought to"
