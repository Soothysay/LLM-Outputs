   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old female with h/o dementia, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia
   (wheelchair bound), and s/p remote right TKR who p/w fall and right
   distal femur fracture, now POD# 1 s/p right femur [**Hospital 12186**] transferred to
   Medicine for acute mental status change, now transferred to MICU for
   hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: Difficult to record accurate pleth
   given Tardive dyskinesia but evidence of hypoxemia on ABG.  Adequate
   oxygenation on floor with face mask/nasal cannula limited by pt
   cooperation in setting of delirium and tardive dyskinesia.  Stable on
   100% NRB on transfer.  Likely V/Q mismatch/shunt with CXR c/w pulmonary
   edema after receiving 2U pRBC intra-op.  Pt without known CHF but still
   about 2L positive for LOS, despite several doses of lasix.  ABGs not
   c/w hypoventilation.  Ddx includes pneumonia (afebrile but elevated
   WBC, does have aspiration risk), PE (post-op but on lovenox ppx, not
   tachycardic but in setting of amiodarone, no cough/hemoptysis).  No h/o
   COPD, no smoking hx, and not wheezy on exam.
   - Given lasix 20mg on floor; will give prn for goal of net neg 1 L per
   day
   - Wean off NRB as tolerated
   - Will hold on coverage of HCAP or aspiration pna for now as no overt
   evidence of pna; leukocytosis explainable by other etiologies
   - Will obtain sputum cultures as possible, check urine legionella
   - Trend CXR
   - Echocardiogram
   - Consider PE work-up if persistent oxygen requirement despite diuresis
   - Ordered for prn nebs but COPD less likely
   - Treating with heparin gtt for ? PE
   - Discuss CTA given risk factors
   .
   # CHF: No known prior history. Last echo in [**2129**] with nl EF, 1+ MR and
   1+ AR. Pt does appear fluid overloaded on exam and by CXR. Mildly
   elevated trops may represent some demand but EKGs stable although
   recent operation could certainly be a stressor.
   - Diuresis as above
   - TSH nl (pt w/ hypothyroidism, on amiodarone)
   - TTE in AM to evaluate EF, valves, WMA
   - Cycle enzymes, monitor on tele, repeat EKG this morning
   - Continue home ASA 325mg
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Increased to 26 this morning. Proteus UTI now found to
   be cipro-resistant so switched to cephalosporin this PM, now on vanc
   and cefepime for empiric HCAP coverage. Also component of stress.
   Possible that pt aspirated as well.  No increased stool output, but
   consider C. diff as pt resides in LTC.  No e/o infection at post-op
   wound.
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC; CIS
   - Check C diff
   - Cont ceftriaxone to cover proteus UTI
   - Hold HCAP/aspiration PNA coverage for now
   - F/u blood cultures; sputum cx & urine legionella as above
   - Monitor surgical wound

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of dementia, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, and a recent right total knee replacement. She presented with acute mental status change and was initially treated for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing persistent oxygen requirement, leukocytosis, and evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. There is suspicion of pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or congestive heart failure. The patient has also been found to have a Proteus urinary tract infection, which is resistant to ciprofloxacin. She has been started on vancomycin and cefepime empiric coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Other concerns include altered mental status, likely due to delirium in the setting of a urinary tract infection and hypoxia. The patient's right distal femur fracture is post-operative and she is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient's persistent oxygen requirement indicates ongoing hypoxemia, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not adequately managed.
2. Pneumonia: Given the elevated white blood cell count, the patient is at risk for developing pneumonia, particularly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Early identification and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's recent surgery and immobilization"

   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: Difficult to record accurate pleth
   given Tardive dyskinesia but evidence of hypoxemia on ABG.  Adequate
   oxygenation on floor with face mask/nasal cannula limited by pt
   cooperation in setting of delirium and tardive dyskinesia.  Stable on
   100% NRB on transfer.  Likely V/Q mismatch/shunt with CXR c/w pulmonary
   edema after receiving 2U pRBC intra-op.  Pt without known CHF but still
   about 2L positive for LOS, despite several doses of lasix.  ABGs not
   c/w hypoventilation.  DDx includes pneumonia (afebrile but elevated
   WBC, does have aspiration risk), PE (post-op but on lovenox ppx, not
   tachycardic but in setting of amiodarone, no cough/hemoptysis).  No h/o
   COPD, no smoking hx, and not wheezy on exam.
   - CTA to evaluate for PE (will give mucomyst and bicarb for renal
   protection)
   - Lasix PRN to goal diuresis of 500-1L per day
   - continue with heparin gtt until CTA
   - Wean to NC as tolerated
   - Hold on coverage of HCAP or aspiration pna for now as no overt
   evidence of pna; leukocytosis explainable by other etiologies
   - Will obtain sputum cultures as possible, check urine legionella
   - Trend CXR

   1+ AR. Pt does appear fluid overloaded on exam and by CXR. Mildly
   elevated trops may represent some demand but EKGs stable although
   recent operation could certainly be a stressor.
   - Diuresis as above
   - TSH nl (pt w/ hypothyroidism, on amiodarone)
   - TTE in AM to evaluate EF, valves, WMA
   - Cycle enzymes, monitor on tele, repeat EKG this morning
   - Continue home ASA 325mg
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Increased to 26 this morning. Proteus UTI now found to
   be cipro-resistant so switched to cephalosporin this PM, now on vanc
   and cefepime for empiric HCAP coverage. Also component of stress.
   Possible that pt aspirated as well.  No increased stool output, but
   consider C. diff as pt resides in LTC.  No e/o infection at post-op
   wound.
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC; CIS
   - Check C diff

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of dementia, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, and a recent right total knee replacement. She presented with acute mental status change and was initially treated in the medicine department before being transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, leukocytosis, altered mental status, and a right distal femur fracture that underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia/Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress, which could be due to pulmonary edema. Continuous diuresis, as tolerated, is recommended. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has been ordered, and the patient has been started on heparin to empirically treat for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). A computed tomography angiography (CTA) will be performed to rule out PE.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count remains elevated. Continuing with the current treatment for urinary tract infection (UTI) is advised. No fevers have been observed, so monitoring the fever curve is essential.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has dementia at baseline, and her mental status appears improved from yesterday. It is crucial to continue monitoring her mental status closely.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old female with h/o dementia, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia
   (wheelchair bound), and s/p remote right TKR who p/w fall and right
   distal femur fracture, now POD# 4 s/p right femur [**Hospital 12186**] transferred to
   Medicine for acute mental status change, now transferred to MICU for
   hypoxic respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: Difficult to record accurate pleth
   given Tardive dyskinesia but evidence of hypoxemia on ABG.  Adequate
   oxygenation on floor with face mask/nasal cannula limited by pt
   cooperation in setting of delirium and tardive dyskinesia.  Stable on
   100% NRB on transfer.  Likely V/Q mismatch/shunt with CXR c/w pulmonary
   edema after receiving 2U pRBC intra-op.  Pt without known CHF but still
   about 2L positive for LOS, despite several doses of lasix.  ABGs not
   c/w hypoventilation.  DDx includes pneumonia (afebrile but elevated
   WBC, does have aspiration risk), PE (post-op but on lovenox ppx, not
   tachycardic but in setting of amiodarone, no cough/hemoptysis).  No h/o
   COPD, no smoking hx, and not wheezy on exam.
   - CTA negative for PE
   - Lasix PRN to goal diuresis of 500-1L per day (another dose of 40 IV
   this morning after K repletion)
   - Aggressive potassium repletion
   - discontinue heparin gtt
   - Wean to NC as tolerated
   - Hold on coverage of HCAP or aspiration pna for now as no overt
   evidence of pna; leukocytosis explainable by other etiologies
   - Will obtain sputum cultures as possible, check urine legionella
   - Trend CXR
   - Echocardiogram today
   - Ordered for prn nebs but COPD less likely
   .
   # CHF: No known prior history. Last echo in [**2129**] with nl EF, 1+ MR and
   1+ AR. Pt does appear fluid overloaded on exam and by CXR. Mildly
   elevated trops may represent some demand but EKGs stable although
   recent operation could certainly be a stressor.
   - Diuresis as above
   - TSH nl (pt w/ hypothyroidism, on amiodarone)
   - TTE this morning to evaluate EF, valves, WMA
   - Cycle enzymes, monitor on tele, repeat EKG this morning
   - Continue home ASA 325mg
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Increased to 25 this morning. Proteus UTI now found to
   be cipro-resistant so switched to cephalosporin.  Also component of
   stress. Possible that pt aspirated as well.  No increased stool output,
   but consider C. diff as pt resides in LTC.  No e/o infection at post-op
   wound.
   - Monitor temp curve & WBC; CIS
   - Check C diff
   - Cont ceftriaxone to cover proteus UTI
   - Hold HCAP/aspiration PNA coverage for now
   - F/u blood cultures; sputum cx
   - Monitor surgical wound
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely delirium in setting of UTI and hypoxia;
   may also have post-op delirium.  Given hypoxia, pneumonia is also
   possible; question aspiration.  Patient is on an extensive psychotropic
   regimen, but do not expect acute withdrawal at this time.
   - ID w/u and treatment as above
   - Keep NPO for now given risk for aspiration
   - Holding gabapentin for now
   - Holding seroquel for now as NPO, low-dose haldol prn agitation
   - Reorient prn, minimize unnecessary medications
   .
   # Guaiac positive stool: Not frank melena.
   - Holding anticoagulation for now, but will consider re-start Lovenox
   .
   # Right distal femur fracture s/p ORIF: POD#4
   - Restart lovenox 30
   - Touch down WB RLE
   - F/u ortho recs
   - Pain control with APAP PR, morphine IV
   .
   # H/o depression/dementia/cerebellar ataxia:
   - Holding po meds (exelon, fluoxetine, lamotrigine, quetiapine) for now
   with aspiration risk but will restart following improvement in mental
   status
   .
   # H/o hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine 32mcg IV for now while NPO, resume
   home 62.5mcg po when able
   .
   # Paroxysmal Afib: In sinus and rate controlled currently
   - Hold amiodarone for now as NPO
   .
   # H/o HTN: restart amlodipine
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes prn, S&S consult -> soft diet with
   1:1 monitoring for liquids

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of dementia, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, and a recent right total knee replacement. She presented with acute mental status changes and was initially transferred to the medicine floor before being transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxic respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient has evidence of hypoxemia, which is likely due to a V/Q mismatch or shunt. She is currently stable on 100% NRB (nonrebreather) mask oxygen.

- Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient appears fluid overloaded on exam and by chest X-ray (CXR), indicating pulmonary edema. There is no known history of CHF, but she may be experiencing acute decompensated heart failure.

- Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased to 25, indicating a possible infection. A Proteus urinary tract infection (UTI) has been identified and is resistant to ciprofloxacin, so she has been switched to a cephalosporin. Aspiration pneumonia is also a concern.

- Altered mental status: The patient likely has delirium due to UTI and hypoxia, as well as possible post-operative delirium. Pneumonia and aspiration are also possible.

- Guaiac positive stool: The patient has a positive guaiac test,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of dementia, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, and previous right total knee replacement. She presented with acute mental status change and was transferred to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty in oxygenation, likely due to a V/Q mismatch or shunt. This could be secondary to pulmonary edema, as indicated by the chest X-ray, or possibly pneumonia. The patient is currently on 100% NRB (nonrebreather) mask for oxygenation.

2. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The patient appears to be fluid overloaded and has evidence of pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray. There is no known history of CHF, but the patient may be in right heart failure given the presence of a small pleural effusion.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. A Proteus urinary tract infection has been identified and is resistant to ciprofloxacin. The patient is being treated with a cephalosporin antibiotic.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to hypoxia, UTI, and possibly post-operative factors. It is also possible that the patient has aspirated, leading to pneumonia"

   # Hypoxic respiratory distress: Difficult to record accurate pleth
   given Tardive dyskinesia but evidence of hypoxemia on ABG.  Adequate
   oxygenation on floor with face mask/nasal cannula limited by pt
   cooperation in setting of delirium and tardive dyskinesia.  Stable on
   100% NRB on transfer.  Likely V/Q mismatch/shunt with CXR c/w pulmonary
   edema after receiving 2U pRBC intra-op.  Pt without known CHF but still
   about 2L positive for LOS, despite several doses of lasix.  ABGs not
   c/w hypoventilation.  DDx includes pneumonia (afebrile but elevated
   WBC, does have aspiration risk), PE (post-op but on lovenox ppx, not
   tachycardic but in setting of amiodarone, no cough/hemoptysis).  No h/o
   COPD, no smoking hx, and not wheezy on exam.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of dementia, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, and previous right total knee replacement. She presented with acute mental status change and was initially managed in the medicine department before being transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, and a small left pleural effusion. She is also positive for guaiac, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a history of depression, dementia, and cerebellar ataxia, and is currently on multiple psychotropic medications. She has a history of hypothyroidism and is taking amiodarone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 133/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Distress: The patient's hypoxemia may be due to a V/Q mismatch or shunt, potentially secondary to pulmonary edema. Adequate oxygenation is challenging due to the patient's cooperation issues related to delirium and tardive dyskinesia.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient exhibits evidence of pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray. This can lead to respiratory distress and impaired oxygenation.
3. Small Left Pleural Effusion: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old woman with dementia who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. She had a recent fall and underwent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of the hip. The patient has been experiencing fluid overload, as indicated by her chest X-ray. She is being diuresed and also found to have guaiac positive brown stool, which suggests gastrointestinal bleeding.

24-hour events:
- The patient received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone.
- She was given furosemide (Lasix) to manage fluid overload.
- The patient has multiple medical conditions, including dementia, and is on several medications, including levoxyl, mucomyst, and aspirin.
- Review of systems remains unchanged except for respiratory distress.

Flowsheet Data:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate is 76 bpm, blood pressure is 141/101 mmHg, respiratory rate is 47 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 94%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows an overall fluid balance of -299 mL.
- The patient received 1,661 mL of fluids and lost 1,960 mL through various outputs.
- Respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula with SpO2 at 94% and ABG results of ///25/.
- Physical examination reveals no acute distress"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a right distal femur fracture post-operative repair, depression/dementia/cerebellar ataxia, hypothyroidism, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently alert and responsive but has intermittent hoarseness, dry mouth, and oral dyskinesia. Vital signs show a stable blood pressure but low oxygen saturation. The patient has a history of hypertension and is on several medications including amiodarone for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and others for depression and dementia. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated leukocyte count and prolonged partial thromboplastin time. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been diuresed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's low oxygen saturation and the use of mechanical ventilation indicate potential respiratory complications. This could include pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or complications related to weaning off the ventilator.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Monitoring the patient's heart rhythm and blood pressure is essential to prevent any cardiac events such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
3. Infection: The elevated leukocyte count may suggest an infection in the body. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is"

   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler
   parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left
   ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size is
   difficult to assess but free wall motion is normal. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
   thickened. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. There is an anterior
   space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic and
   mitral regurgitation. Mild ascending aortic dilation. Moderate
   tricuspid regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2130-2-8**], pulmonary hypertension has progressed. There is
   more tricuspid regurgitation.

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of dementia, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, and previous right total knee replacement. She presents with acute mental status change and hypoxic respiratory distress. She was transferred to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress.

The patient has several potential medical complications based on the provided information. These include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty in oxygenation, as evidenced by low oxygen saturation levels. This could be due to a V/Q mismatch or shunt, possibly exacerbated by pulmonary edema.

2. Potential pneumonia: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. Given her risk factors, pneumonia is a possible differential diagnosis, especially considering her aspiration risk.

3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has been on low molecular weight heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. However, a CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism. Nonetheless, it remains in the differential diagnosis due to the patient's recent surgery and immobilization.

4. Congestive heart failure: The patient appears fluid overloaded on examination and by chest X-ray. She also has mild mitral and aortic regurgitation on echocardiogram. These findings suggest the possibility of congestive heart failure.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which can be attributed to stress, infection, or both. It"

   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler
   parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left
   ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size is
   difficult to assess but free wall motion is normal. The ascending aorta
   is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
   thickened. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. There is an anterior
   space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic and
   mitral regurgitation. Mild ascending aortic dilation. Moderate
   tricuspid regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2130-2-8**], pulmonary hypertension has progressed. There is
   more tricuspid regurgitation.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, Darvocet-N 50, phenothiazines, and Percocet. She was previously on antibiotics such as vancomycin, cefipime, and ceftriaxone. The patient is receiving various medications including furosemide, CTX for a urinary tract infection, ASA, iron supplementation, Tums for stomach acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, MVI, Floxin, amiodarone, oxycodone, and morphine.

24-hour events include a trans-thoracic echo performed at 10:29 AM. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104-139 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has an ABG result of /29. Physical examination reveals crackles in the chest bilaterally, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic function.

Lab results show a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL, white blood cell count of 392 K/uL, blood glucose level of 110 mg/dL, sodium level of 29 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, chloride level of 26 mg/dL, magnesium level of 0.7 mg/dL, and calcium level of 8.6 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate elevated creatinine levels and slightly elevated troponin-T levels. Electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypoxemia, acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infection, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis are among the patient's current medical issues.

The patient's condition is described as critically ill."
