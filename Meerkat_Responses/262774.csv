   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF > 60%), CAD s/p
   CABG in [**2079**] and STEMI [**2102-5-19**] with three stents placed, ESRD on
   hemodialysis s/p failed transplant and known chronic bilateral pleural
   effusions with associated trapped lung now transferred to the MICU for
   refractory hypotension and worsening oxygen requirement.
   Shock:  Most likely etiology is septic shock.  No evidence of
   hypovolemia or hemorrhage.  Echocardiogram without change from priors
   making cardiogenic and obstructive shock unlikely.  Hemodynamic change
   occurred in the setting of low grade fevers and rising WBC count.  Most
   likely etiology would be pneumonia although blood stream infection also
   possible given that he is a dialysis patient. He now has received 5 L
   normal saline and blood pressure is refractory despite maximum dose
   peripheral dopamine.
   - subclavian line now in place
   - continue dopamine and add levophed for blood pressure support
   - IVF to maintain CVP > [**11-27**], MAP > 65, cannot monitor urine output
   given ESRD
   - measure mixed venous O2 saturation and consider dobutamine
   - guaiac all stools
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia
   coverage
   - follow up cultures from [**Hospital3 **]
   - blood and sputum cultures
   - will check random cortisol and consider cortisol stimulation since on
   chronic steroids
   Pleural Effusions/Hypoxia:  Most likely related to pleural effusions.
   No clear evidence of heart failure on exam.  No evidence of expanding
   pneumothorax on new xray. Unlikely pulmonary embolism given chronic
   nature although he has not had a recent CTA or VQ scan.  Pulmonary
   consult service and thoracics have been following.  He underwent
   thoracentesis on [**2102-5-29**] with reaccumulation of fluid.  Fluid studies
   consistent with transudate although no pH or gram stain sent.
   - currently unable to receive dialysis because of hypotension
   - will continue to monitor volume status closely
   - consider repeat CT scan if worsening given known loculated effusions
   and concern for development of empyema
   - continue vancomycin and zozyn for HAP
   Coronary Artery Disease:: s/p recent posterior MI with PCI and three
   vision stents complicated by vfib arrest requiring shocks. Currently
   chest pain free.   New echocardiogram without evidenence of post-MI
   complications. EKG with new TWI but no ST segment changes.  Repeat
   cardiac enzymes with flat CKs.
   - holding carvedilol
   - cont ASA 325mg
   - cont Plavix 75mg
   - cont pravastatin
   - monitor on telemetry
   Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure:
   - holding carvedilol
   - holding hydralaxine and isosorbide
   - holding dialysis
   Atrial Fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - on telemetry
   - heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - continue aspirin
   - continue digoxin
   ESRD on HD s/p failed transplant:
   - cont sevelamer
   - cont prednisone and fluconazole
   Gout: Stable
   - continue allopruinol 100mg PO
   Recurrent [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis
   - continue fluconazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, chronic bilateral pleural effusions, and a recent posterior myocardial infarction. He was transferred to the MICU for refractory hypotension and worsening oxygen requirement. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation but is now in sinus rhythm. He is on multiple medications including aspirin, carvedilol, digoxin, sevelamer, prednisone, fluconazole, allopurinol, and citalopram. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia or bloodstream infection, given his immunocompromised state as a dialysis patient. He is receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine and levophed, and his blood pressure remains refractory. He is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's pleural effusions are chronic and likely related to his condition. His recent echocardiogram showed no evidence of post-MI complications. He is currently unable to receive dialysis due to hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening septic shock: The patient's hypotension and worsening oxygen requirement indicate ongoing septic shock. If not properly managed, this can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and potentially death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF > 60%), CAD s/p
   CABG in [**2079**] and STEMI [**2102-5-19**] with three stents placed, ESRD on
   hemodialysis s/p failed transplant and known chronic bilateral pleural
   effusions with associated trapped lung now transferred to the MICU for
   refractory hypotension and worsening oxygen requirement.
   # Shock:
   Most likely etiology is septic shock.  Most likely etiology would be
   pneumonia although blood stream infection also possible given that he
   is a dialysis patient. Patient liberated from dopamine and patient had
   increasing norepi requirement overnight. Does not appear to be
   cardiogenic shock given unimpressive TTE from [**2102-5-31**]. Patient on low
   dose prednisone and random cortisol yesterday was 11.5.
   - Measure central venous oxygen sat
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia
   coverage
   - follow-up cultures from [**Hospital3 **]
   - follow-up blood (unable to obtain sputum sample or urine sample)
   - Start hydrocortisone IV 50 mg Q6H
   # Pleural Effusions/Hypoxia:
   Most likely related to pleural effusions. Oxygen requirement down to 3L
   by nasal cannula and dyspnea is resolved.
   - closely monitor ABGs given propensity for patient to hypoventilate,
   likely related to restrictive disase in setting of chronic pleural
   effusions and trapped lung.
   - HD again when not limited by hypotension
   #Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p recent posterior MI with PCI and three vision stents complicated by
   vfib arrest requiring shocks. Currently chest pain free.   New
   echocardiogram without evidenence of post-MI complications. EKG with
   new TWI but no ST segment changes.  Repeat cardiac enzymes with flat
   CKs.
   - holding carvedilol
   - cont ASA 325mg
   - cont Plavix 75mg
   - cont pravastatin
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure:
   - holding carvedilol
   - holding hydralaxine and isosorbide
   - holding dialysis
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - on telemetry
   - heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - continue aspirin
   - continue digoxin
   # ESRD on HD s/p failed transplant:
   - cont sevelamer
   - cont prednisone and fluconazole
   - dialysis unlikely today as hypotension still resolving
   # Gout: Stable
   - continue allopruinol 100mg PO
   # Recurrent [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis
   - continue fluconazole

   Assessment and Plan
   HOTN/septic shock.  CVP 11-13, so seems less likely to respond to
   fluids.  Will check SvO2 from line to get a sense of his cardiac
   output.
   Unclear what infection may have caused this as now clear source
   although he could have PNA that is difficult to assess given his
   pleural
   effusions.  Will continue empiric broad coverage.
   Will start stress dose steroids as he is on chronic low dose prednisone
   Hypercarbia:  must be due to some level of restriction with trapped

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), presenting with leukocytosis, hypotension, oliguria, and septic shock. He has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/47 to 180/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals crackles in both lungs, absent right radial pulse, present left radial pulse, right dorsal pedal (DP) pulse, and left DP pulse. Neurological examination shows attentive and oriented patient with purposeful movements. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, and lactic acid level, while showing low platelet count, sodium level, and potassium level. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications for his condition. The plan includes continuing empiric broad coverage, starting stress dose steroids, and monitoring for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate level and low platelet count suggest possible sepsis-related organ dysfunction. Close"

   65 year old male with a history of diastolic CHF (EF > 60%), CAD s/p
   CABG in [**2079**] and STEMI [**2102-5-19**] with three stents placed, ESRD on
   hemodialysis s/p failed transplant and known chronic bilateral pleural
   effusions with associated trapped lung now transferred to the MICU for
   refractory hypotension and worsening oxygen requirement.
   # Shock:
   Most likely etiology is septic shock.  Most likely etiology would be
   pneumonia although blood stream infection also possible given that he
   is a dialysis patient. Patient liberated from dopamine and patient had
   increasing norepi requirement overnight. Does not appear to be
   cardiogenic shock given unimpressive TTE from [**2102-5-31**]. Patient on low
   dose prednisone and random cortisol yesterday was 11.5.
   - Measure central venous oxygen sat
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia
   coverage
   - follow-up cultures from [**Hospital3 **]
   - follow-up cultures
   - cont hydrocortisone IV 50 mg Q6H
   # Pleural Effusions/Hypoxia:
   Most likely related to pleural effusions. Oxygen requirement down to 3L
   by nasal cannula and dyspnea is resolved.
   - closely monitor ABGs given propensity for patient to hypoventilate,
   likely related to restrictive disase in setting of chronic pleural
   effusions and trapped lung.
   - HD again when not limited by hypotension
   #Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p recent posterior MI with PCI and three vision stents complicated by
   vfib arrest requiring shocks. Currently chest pain free.   New
   echocardiogram without evidenence of post-MI complications. EKG with
   new TWI but no ST segment changes.  Repeat cardiac enzymes with flat
   CKs.
   - holding carvedilol
   - cont ASA 325mg
   - cont Plavix 75mg
   - cont pravastatin
   - monitor on telemetry
   # Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure:
   - holding carvedilol
   - holding hydralaxine and isosorbide
   - holding dialysis
   # Atrial Fibrillation:
   Currently in sinus rhythm.
   - on telemetry
   - heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - continue aspirin
   - continue digoxin
   # ESRD on HD s/p failed transplant:
   - cont sevelamer
   - cont prednisone and fluconazole
   - dialysis unlikely today as hypotension still resolving
   # Gout: Stable
   - continue allopruinol 100mg PO
   # Recurrent [**Female First Name (un) **] esophagitis
   - continue fluconazole
   # Depression:
   - continue celexa

   hemodialysis s/p failed transplant and known chronic bilateral pleural
   effusions with associated trapped lung now transferred to the MICU for
   refractory hypotension and worsening oxygen requirement.
   # Shock:
   Most likely etiology is septic shock.  Most likely etiology would be
   pneumonia although blood stream infection also possible given that he
   is a dialysis patient. Patient liberated from dopamine and patient had
   increasing norepi requirement overnight. Does not appear to be
   cardiogenic shock given unimpressive TTE from [**2102-5-31**]. Patient on low
   dose prednisone and random cortisol yesterday was 11.5.  Improved blood
   pressures, weaned neo and levo.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia
   coverage
   - follow-up cultures from [**Hospital3 **]
   - follow-up cultures
   - start to taper hydrocortisone IV 50 mg Q6H to q12
   # Pleural Effusions/Hypoxia:
   Most likely related to pleural effusions. Oxygen requirement down to 3L
   by nasal cannula and dyspnea is resolved.  Stable resp status off
   pressors.
   - closely monitor ABGs given propensity for patient to hypoventilate,
   likely related to restrictive disase in setting of chronic pleural
   effusions and trapped lung.
   - HD today, tolerating well
   #Coronary Artery Disease:
   s/p recent posterior MI with PCI and three vision stents complicated by
   vfib arrest requiring shocks. Currently chest pain free.   New
   echocardiogram without evidenence of post-MI complications. EKG with
   new TWI but no ST segment changes.  Repeat cardiac enzymes with flat
   CKs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diastolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He was admitted to the MICU for refractory hypotension and worsening oxygen requirement. The patient has been titrated down on pressors overnight without any events. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/43 mmHg to 123/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation but currently in sinus rhythm. Physical examination findings include a prominent second heart sound, a II/VI murmur at the left lower sternal border, and multiple sores on the extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactic acid levels. The patient is being treated with multiple medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, heparin, norepinephrine, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: Given the patient's elevated white blood cell count and high creatinine levels, there is a possibility of sepsis leading to septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid status is necessary.
2. Pneumonia:"
