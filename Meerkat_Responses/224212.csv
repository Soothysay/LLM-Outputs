","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female who underwent laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with gastroplasty and Nissen fundoplication. Postoperatively, she developed small bowel obstruction (SBO) and required a laparotomy with enterotomy due to peritonitis. She is now being considered for an open washout and oversew.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension post-surgery, which required fluid resuscitation and the use of pressors.
2. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient developed SBO, which is causing intestinal obstruction and may require further intervention.
3. Pain Control: The patient requires pain management due to acute and chronic pain associated with the surgical procedure and underlying conditions.
4. Neurologic Status: The patient is sedated and intubated, making neurological assessment challenging. Neurologic status should be closely monitored.
5. Cardiovascular Stability: The patient's cardiovascular status needs close monitoring due to the use of pressors and ongoing fluid resuscitation.
6. Respiratory Support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
7. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has a history of peritonitis and requires ongoing monitoring of her gastrointestinal status.
8. Renal Function: The patient's renal function appears to be stable based on the current laboratory results.
9. Hematologic Stability: The patient's hematological"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old female who underwent laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with gastroplasty and Nissen fundoplication. She now presents with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and laparotomy due to enterotomy and peritonitis, requiring an open washout and oversew. The patient is intubated and sedated, with ongoing hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Sepsis: The presence of peritonitis increases the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death if not promptly treated.

2. Respiratory complications: Intubation and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Proper adherence to VAP bundle protocols is crucial to minimize this risk.

3. Renal impairment: The patient's current low urine output may indicate renal impairment. Close monitoring of fluid balance and daily serum creatinine levels is necessary to assess kidney function and guide appropriate management.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization due to bed rest and surgery increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin should be implemented.

5. Wound infection: Surgical wounds are susceptible to infection, especially in the setting of peritonitis. Regular wound assessment and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female who underwent laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with gastroplasty and Nissen fundoplication on [**5-/2108**]. Postoperatively, she developed peritonitis and small bowel obstruction (SBO), leading to an open washout and oversew procedure. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, oliguria/anuria, hyponatremia, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. She is also experiencing pain, which is being managed with sedation and analgesics. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 110/72 mmHg, heart rate of 103 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's neurologic status is alert and oriented, but she is delirious. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal creatinine levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient has a history of SBO, which can lead to complications such as intestinal ischemia, perforation, and infection.
2. Peritonitis: The patient developed peritonitis postoperatively, which is an inflammation of the peritoneum. If left untreated, it can progress to severe infection and sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low"

The patient is a 78-year-old female who underwent laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair with gastroplasty and Nissen fundoplication. She now presents with small bowel obstruction (SBO), including intussusception and adhesions, leading to peritonitis. The patient requires an open washout and oversew. Her current condition includes hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, oliguria/anuria, pain control, and hypothermia. She is alert and oriented with stable cardiovascular status, stable pulmonary function, and soft abdomen with minimal gastric output. Renal function is monitored, and nutrition is being considered with the start of clear liquids. The patient has an increased white blood cell count but is afebrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and history of peritonitis suggest a risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased heart rate, or worsening pain, is crucial.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension indicates a risk of inadequate blood flow to vital organs. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management, including fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy if necessary, is essential.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lab results show abnormalities in sodium, potassium, and magnesium levels. Close monitoring and correction of these imbalances are necessary to prevent complications like cardiac arrhythmias or muscle"
