She was recently diagnosed with a right hilar mass and there is concern for metastatic disease. The patient presented to the ICU with fever, dyspnea, and hypoxemia. A CT angiogram revealed a pulmonary embolism. She was started on a heparin drip and admitted to the MICU Green overnight for increasing dyspnea and cough. The patient experienced some mild hemoptysis this morning and had a supra-therapeutic PTT.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 101/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her weight is 96.4 kg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,299 mL and output of 440 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device and her ABG results are pending.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal breath sounds and diffuse polyphonic wheezing. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed. Neurologic examination is incomplete. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, hypotension (resolved), cancer (lung"

","The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, C. difficile colitis with ileostomy, and a recent diagnosis of right hilar mass. The PET scan showed FDG uptake in the right acetabulum, which is concerning for metastatic disease. The patient was admitted with fever, dyspnea, and hypoxemia. A CTA chest revealed a left segmental pulmonary embolus and likely post-obstructive pneumonia. 

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy in the operating room, during which an endobronchial lesion was noted in the right upper lobe bronchus. The frozen section was consistent with small cell lung cancer, and an uncovered stent was placed due to combined intrinsic and extrinsic compression of the bronchus intermedius.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, Benadryl, and Actonel. Her last dose of antibiotics was levofloxacin. She is currently receiving multiple ICU medications including morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, hydromorphone, heparin sodium, and others.

Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 106/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events.

","The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, C. difficile colitis with ileostomy, recent diagnosis of right hilar mass, and PET scan showing FDG uptake in the right acetabulum concerning for metastatic disease. She was admitted with fever and dyspnea, and a CT angiogram revealed a left segmental pulmonary embolism and likely post-obstructive pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/73 mmHg to 126/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her weight is 96.4 kg, and fluid balance shows an input of 1955 mL, output of 1070 mL, and a negative balance of -885 mL.

The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 22.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 30.6%, platelet count of 309 K/uL, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, glucose of 148 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia with levofloxacin and possible COPD exacerbation with solumedrol. She also has hypotension resolved with crystalloid resuscitation, awaiting a transthoracic echo to evaluate right ventricular function. The patient has a planned diagnostic bronchoscopy today to evaluate the lung mass, and the heparin drip has been stopped for the procedure. An inferior vena cava filter is being considered in case of major hemoptysis post-bronchoscopy. The patient is on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation and was off coumadin due to difficulty with absorption in the setting of ileostomy.

In summary, the patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, possible COPD exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, hypotension, lung cancer, and atrial fibrillation. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD, further embolic events, worsening of hypotension, progression of lung cancer, and complications related to atrial fibrillation."

 PNEUMONIA, OTHER: continued on levaquin  daily for planned empiric 7
   day course for likely post-obstructive pneumonia.  Persistent
   leukocytosis may be related to high dose steroid use.  Given history of
   COPD with frequent exacerbations will decrease solumedrol to 40mg daily
   for 4 more days without taper
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) now resolved for 3L crystalloid resuscitation
   with good urine output.  TTE without significant RV dysfunction.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG: Plan for diagnostic bronchoscopy
   today.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE: IVC filter placed given history of
   hemoptysis.  Depending on results of bronchoscopy may resume
   therapeutic anticoagulation after bronchoscopy.
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: on amiodarone as outpatient.  Was off coumadin as
   outpatient due to difficulty with absorption in setting of ileostomy,
   given PE in setting of malignancy a LMWH would be ideal for
   anticoagulation

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, C. difficile colitis with ileostomy, and a recent diagnosis of right hilar mass with suspected metastatic disease. She was admitted with fever and dyspnea, and diagnosed with left segmental pulmonary embolism and likely post-obstructive pneumonia. She has been started on IV antibiotics and is awaiting bronchoscopy for biopsy. She has allergies to penicillins and actonel, and has received various ICU medications including morphine, heparin, and steroids. Her current vital signs are stable, but she has persistent leukocytosis and hypotension which has resolved after fluid resuscitation. Her recent lab results show elevated WBC, normal Hct, and slightly elevated Cr levels. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, hypotension, pulmonary embolism, and cancer. The plan is to continue empirical antibiotic therapy for the pneumonia, decrease the dose of steroids, place an IVC filter due to hemoptysis, and resume therapeutic anticoagulation after bronchoscopy. She is currently on NPO status, with RISS for glycemic control, and receiving prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and she will likely need to be observed in the ICU today depending on the results of the bronchoscopy.

   86 year old female w/ a history of AF, RA, being worked up for likely
   metastatic lung cancer who presents with worsening hypoxia, fever, and
   cough, found to have a PE and potential post-obstructive pneumonia.
   #: Pulmonary Embolism: Patient with PE on CTA after presenting with
   hypoxia.  Patient at increased risk in the setting of likely
   malignancy.
   -- continue on heparin overnight
   -- with data suggesting improved outcomes with lovenox in patients with
   malignancy, will switch over to lovenox when feasible.  Would like to
   make sure no evidence of hemoptysis as well as clarify plan for bronch
   first.
   -- LENIs to see if has LE DVTs in case develops contraindication to
   anticoagulation or TTE shows limited reserve for new PE
   -- TTE to evaluate for worsened rv function
   # Pneumonia: While patinet's fevers, leukocytosis, and hypoxia could
   certianly be attributed to patient's PE, CT demonstration of likely
   post-obstructive pneumonia is consistent many other systemic symptoms
   also experiencing.  Likely has component of COPD with diffuse wheezes
   throughout all lung fields
   -- send sputum culture
   -- continue levofoxacin renally dosed.
   -- f/u blood culture
   -- atrovent and albuterol nebs
   -- cont 80mg IV solumdedrol Iv q8 in the setting of planned bronch with
   taper on prednisone following.
   # Hypotension: Differential could include volume depletion vs.
   infection w/ sepsis vs. hemodynamic instability secondary to PE vs.
   adrenal insufficiency.  Patient without distended neck veins on exam.
   No gross evidence of marked septic shock, and as pressures have
   stabilized after 2L of NS 3 hours ago, would favor volume depletion.
   Patinet has only been on prednisone for the last 7 days, so feel
   adrenal insufficiency would be less likely.
   -- 3 larbe bore IVs
   -- 1L of NS over night
   -- continue to monitor
   -- f/u blood, sputum, and urine culture
   # Lung mass: Concerning features for metastatic lung CA.  Has plan for
   bronch tomorrow.  Likely will be postponed in the setting of high O2
   requirment.
   -- d/w throacis plan for bronch in setting of O2 requirment and
   heparin.
   # PAF:  Currently in sinus, managed on amioderone and metoprolol.  Not
   anticoagulated as difficulty with coumadin absorption with illeostomy.
   Will decrease ASA to 81mg while on heparin/lovenox, but holding in plan
   for bx.
   # Hypertension:  Managed with lisinopril, lasix, HCTZ, and metoprolol.
   -- hold to see where BP settles in setting of recent hypotension.
   # Hypothyroidism: cont home synthroid.
   # Gout: Cont colchicine
   # RA: No active disease, although has been on one week of predinsone.
   Will continue prednisone 20mg, with plan for taper per rheumatologist.
   - cont tramadol.
   - cont prednisone at higher dose.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and suspected metastatic lung cancer. She presents with worsening hypoxia, fever, and cough, and has been found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) and potential post-obstructive pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/73 to 126/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm.

The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests and procedures, including an ultrasound, trans-thoracic echo, and computed tomography angiography (CTA). The CTA confirmed the presence of a PE. The trans-thoracic echo revealed normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), normal right ventricular (RV) side and wall motion, trivial pericardial effusion, and no valvular problems. The patient also has right lower extremity edema of 1+ and left lower extremity edema of 1+.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22.7 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, slightly elevated glucose level of"

- Presenting symptoms: worsening hypoxia, fever, and cough.
- Found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) and potential post-obstructive pneumonia.
- Patient is being managed with heparin and will switch to low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) when feasible.
- Plan for bronchoscopy with biopsy tomorrow, but it may be postponed due to high oxygen requirements.
- Other medical conditions include pulmonary hypertension, gout, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis.
- The patient is currently on various medications including morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, hydromorphone, heparin, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with a PE, which can lead to further complications such as hypoxia, respiratory distress, and potentially fatal outcomes if not managed appropriately.
2. Post-Obstructive Pneumonia: The presence of a lung mass and subsequent PE suggests potential post-obstructive pneumonia. This condition can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of secondary infections.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which can have various causes including volume depletion, infection with sepsis, hemodynamic instability secondary to PE, or adrenal ins"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female w/ a history of AF, RA, being worked up for likely
   metastatic lung cancer who presents with worsening hypoxia, fever, and
   cough, found to have a PE and potential post-obstructive pneumonia.
   #: Pulmonary Embolism: Patient with PE on CTA after presenting with
   hypoxia.
   -TTE w/o signs of R heart strain
   -Bilat DVTs seen on LENIs- s/p IVC filter plcmt [**12-3**]
   -restart heparin gtt after bronch, switch to lovenox eventually
   # Lung mass: Concerning features for metastatic lung CA.
   -bronch [**12-4**], f/u results
   # Pneumonia: While patinet's fevers, leukocytosis, and hypoxia could
   certianly be attributed to patient's PE, CT demonstration of likely
   post-obstructive pneumonia is consistent many other systemic symptoms
   also experiencing.  Likely has component of COPD with diffuse wheezes
   throughout all lung fields
   -- f/u sputum culture
   -- continue levofoxacin renally dosed.
   -- f/u blood culture
   -- atrovent and albuterol nebs
   -- taper steroids to prednisone 40mg po daily x 3 additional days
   # Hypotension: resolved, monitor.
   -- 3 larbe bore IVs
   -- 1L of NS over night
   -- f/u blood, sputum, and urine culture
   # PAF:  Currently in sinus, managed on amiodarone and metoprolol.  Not
   anticoagulated as difficulty with coumadin absorption with illeostomy.
   Will decrease ASA to 81mg while on heparin/lovenox, but holding in plan
   for bx.
   # Hypertension:  Managed with lisinopril, lasix, HCTZ, and metoprolol.
   -- hold to see where BP settles in setting of recent hypotension.
   # Hypothyroidism: cont home synthroid.
   # Gout: Cont colchicine
   # RA: No active disease, although has been on one week of predinsone.
   Will continue prednisone 20mg, with plan for taper per rheumatologist.
   - cont tramadol.
   - cont prednisone at higher dose.
   # Tremor: cont primidone.
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / regular diet NPO for bronch
   # PPX: heparin gtt
   # ACCESS: PIV x 3

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, rheumatoid arthritis, and suspected metastatic lung cancer. She presented with worsening hypoxia, fever, and cough and was found to have a pulmonary embolism and potential post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has undergone several interventions including the placement of an IVC filter, trans-thoracic echo, and initiation of mucomyst with fluids. She is currently on multiple medications including morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, hydromorphone, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 106/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her blood work reveals elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal potassium levels, and elevated creatinine. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema. She is currently receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism, which is a blockage in one or more arteries in the lungs. This can lead to difficulty breathing, chest pain, and potentially fatal complications if not managed properly.
2. Post-Obstructive Pneumonia: The patient's lung"
