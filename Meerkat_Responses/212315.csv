","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 91-year-old male with a history of CAD, COPD, CHF, PVD, DMII, and TIA. He was admitted to the CCU for unresponsiveness and is currently experiencing episodes of unresponsiveness with possible transient cerebral hypoxia. He also has worsening aeration of the left lung, persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, and mild vascular congestion. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is alert and oriented to person and date. 

Medical Complications:

1. Unresponsiveness: The most likely etiology at this time is LLL collapse leading to transient hypoxia in the setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease with supply/demand mismatch. This may also represent a TIA from an embolic source, although less likely. The patient's obstructive lung disease appears to be at baseline with minimal wheezing and an ABG on 2L nc with appropriate pH and compensatory metabolic compensation in setting of chronic CO2 retention.

2. Carotid Stenosis: The patient has severe bilateral carotid stenosis and is being transferred for potential carotid stenting. The CTA neck will assess carotid and basilar flow. The patient should continue taking ASA 81 mg daily and atorvastatin.

3. Respiratory: The patient has known COPD and is on supplemental overnight O2. He also has an"

 Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS (valve area

   Patient presented to the OSH for an episode of unresponsiveness and had
   a carotid doppler study which showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis.
   He was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for potential b/l carotid artery stenting.
   While on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 pt had episode of unresponsiveness w/ jerking motions
   which did not appear tonic-clonic.  Neurology was consulted and patient
   was transferred to CCU for further care.
   # Unresponsiveness: Neurology was consulted, and after speaking to the
   daughter, believes episode was most likely [**1-17**] anxiety attack and
   ?hyperventilation as patient reportedly has episodes of labored
   tachypnea at home.  Pt receives 0.5mg Ativan qAM at home, which he had
   not received.  Also possibly [**1-17**] Ativan withdrawal, despite small
   dose.  Also possible is LLL collapse seen on CXR leading to transient
   hypoxia in setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease with
   supply/demand mismatch.  TIA and seizure are unlikely.  From an
   obstructive lung disease standpoint, he appears to be at baseline with
   minimal wheezing and an ABG on 2L nc with appropriate pH and
   compensatory metabolic compensation in setting of chronic CO2
   retention.

   CCU ATTENDING  PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the progress note.  The documented physical examination is
   consistent with my examination.
   History:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]

   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man who was
   transferred for evaluation of his bilateral carotid stenosis, right
   lower extremity with ulceration, and altered mental status.   There may
   have been a possible underlying seizure activity.
   His CTA shows bilateral 80% stenosis.  He has responded with diuresis
   and his pulmonary issues are improving.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism (PE) on coumadin, mild aortic stenosis (AS), and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for unresponsiveness and has been evaluated for various medical conditions.

The patient experienced an episode of unresponsiveness with jerking motions, which was initially believed to be a convulsive activity similar to anxiety attacks or Ativan withdrawal. However, it is now thought to be more likely due to transient hypoxia caused by left lower lobe collapse seen on chest X-ray and bilateral carotid occlusive disease with supply-demand mismatch. Other potential causes such as transient ischemic attack (TIA) and seizure are less likely.

The patient has a history of CAD and had a complaint of chest pain this morning, which resolved spontaneously and resembles his chronic chest/axillary pressure. He is currently asymptomatic, and the admission ECG showed new TWI but with low suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The patient also has signs of volume overload, likely secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema, as evidenced by elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, physical examination findings, admission chest X-ray, and elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization. He received lasix 40 IV"

   Assessment and Plan
 Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS(valve area
   1.2-1.9cm2), and DM 2 transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness.
   carotid doppler study at OSH which demonstrated severe bilateral
   carotid stenosis. Tnsf to [**Hospital1 **] for potential bil CE. While on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 had
   episode of unresponsiveness w/ ? SA. Episode likely [**1-17**] transient
   cerebral hypoxia. No signs of worsening volume overload/ COPD
   exacerbation. Has had LLL atelectasis & new LLL collapse seen on cxr.
   Head CT negative. Tx
d Lasix, nebs & freq cpt. Was diuresed for approx
   4L LOS. Tnsf to CCU for close observation pre cath.
   [**Age over 90 **]M CAD (occluded LAD with R->L collateral flow), COPD admitted from
   OSH after episode of unresponsiveness and slurred speech. CT showed
   severe bilateral carotid stenosis, transferred for potential carotid
   stenting. On admission [**2174-9-25**], also found to have CHF on exam. This
   AM pt with an episode of unresponsiveness and question of convulsions
   that lasted a few minutes with several minutes of confusion post event.
   Transferred to CCU for monitoring.
   91M with bilateral carotid stenosis transferred for potential carotid
   stenting, transferred to CCU after unresponsive episode. Episode likely
   [**1-17**] transient cerebral hypoxia, although etiology is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] signs
   of worsening volume overload, COPD exacerbation. Has had LLL
   atelectasis on [**9-14**] CT but this may have progressed.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness: Most likely [**1-17**] anxiety attack and
   ?hyperventilation as patient
   etioloigy at this time is LLL collapse leading to transient hypoxia in
   setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease with supple/demand
   mismatch.  This may also represent a TIA from embolic source, although
   less likely.  From an obstructive lung disease standpoint, he appears
   to be at baseline with minimal wheezing and an ABG on 2L nc with
   appropriate pH and compensatory metabolic compensation in setting of
   chronic CO2 retention. Additionally, this may represent new seizure
   activity, although patient does not have a history of seizure activity.
   Prior to transfer to CCU, [**Hospital1 1276**] team already consulted neurology for
   possible TIA and/or seizure.
   - Chest PT, mucolytics
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Non-contrast CTH and CTA neck
   - Follow-up neurology recs
   - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
   - Now written for home Ativan qAM
   .
   # Carotid stenosis: Patient transferred for carotid intervention, will
   discuss with attending whether pt is likely to have procedure doen
   today.
   - f/u CTA neck to assess carotid and basilar flow.
   - Continue ASA 81 and atorvastatin.
   - Continue to hold coumadin, continue heparin (more for PE than for
   carotid artery stenosis)
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient with known COPD on supplemental overnight O2,
   although this appears to be stable. Based on physical exam, admission
   CXR, and elevated BNP, he likely also has an element of volume overload
   secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  In addition, he was noted to
   have elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization in [**6-23**].
   Patient received lasix 40 IV this AM.  CXR following unresponsiveness
   now with LLL collapse.
   - Lasix prn with goal TBB -1000 cc/day. Check PM lytes.
   - Albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Chest PT and mucolytics as above.
   .
   # CAD: Patient not currently complaining of chest pain or anginal
   equivalents.  ECG with new TWI, although low suspicion for ACS at this
   time.
   - Continue metoprolol, ASA, statin, imdur.
   .
   # Pump: Patient with preserved LVEF on last echo, although with signs
   of volume overload currently.
   - Continue metoprolol, lasix as above.
   .
   # Rhythmn: Sinus with 1:1 conduction.
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear baseline, although patient received 1 unit PRBC at
   OSH prior to transfer for hemoglobin 10.  Patient with iron studies
   consistent with iron deficiency anemia.
   - Trend hct, transfuse for hct<21
   - Guaiac stools
   - Call PCP and assess colonoscopy history.
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism: Patient with history of PE in [**4-23**] on coumadin.
   Unclear based on review of records if there was an inciting event and
   need for continued anticoagulation.
   - Until clarified, will cover with heparin gtt for INR<2, although
   patient may not require continued anticoagulation.

   # DM: Hold home glipizide. Continue HISS and accuchecks.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now pending improvement in mental status. NPO at midnight.
   Replete as necessary.
   Access: PIV
   PPx: Therapeutic INR, heparin gtt with subtherapeutic as above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of CAD, COPD, PE, mild AS, and DM2. He was transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness and potential bilateral carotid endarterectomy (CE). The patient had episodes of unresponsiveness with unclear etiology, and it is suspected to be transient cerebral hypoxia due to bilateral carotid stenosis.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from his conditions:

1. Carotid stenosis: The patient has severe bilateral carotid stenosis, which increases the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes if not managed properly.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD with occluded LAD and right-to-left collateral flow. He also has mild AS and CHF. These cardiac conditions can lead to further complications such as heart failure exacerbation or cardiac arrhythmias.

3. Respiratory issues: The patient has known COPD and is on supplemental overnight O2. He also has evidence of volume overload with elevated BNP and signs of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This can result in respiratory failure or worsening of COPD symptoms.

4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE in the past and is currently on anticoagulation therapy with heparin. There is uncertainty about the need for continued anticoagulation, and if discontinued,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism (PE), mild aortic stenosis (AS), and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for unresponsiveness and had a carotid doppler study showing severe bilateral carotid stenosis. The patient experienced episodes of unresponsiveness with jerking motions, which were initially suspected to be anxiety attacks or Ativan withdrawal. However, the neurology consultant believes that the episodes may be due to transient hypoxia caused by bilateral carotid occlusive disease, possibly exacerbated by left lower lobe (LLL) collapse seen on chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate (HR) of 80 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 119/44 to 148/71 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert, oriented to time but not place, and has normal air entry bilaterally except for decreased breath sounds at the left base with coarse rales at the right lower lobe (RLL).

   Assessment and Plan
 Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS, and DM 2
   transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness.
   Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]yo male (DNR/DNI) w/ a PMH of CAD, CHF, PVD, DMII,TIA, PE on
   coumadin & mild AS (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Had carotid doppler study
   at OSH which demonstrated severe bilateral carotid stenosis. Tnsf to
   [**Hospital1 **] for potential bil CE. While on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 had episode of
   unresponsiveness w/ ? SA. Episode likely [**1-17**] transient cerebral
   hypoxia. No signs of worsening volume overload/ COPD exacerbation. Has
   had LLL atelectasis & new LLL collapse seen on cxr. Head CT negative.
   Tx
d Lasix, nebs & freq cpt. Was diuresed for approx 4L LOS. Tnsf to
   CCU for close observation pre cath.
   [**Age over 90 **]M CAD (occluded LAD with R->L collateral flow), COPD admitted from
   OSH after episode of unresponsiveness and slurred speech. CT showed
   severe bilateral carotid stenosis, transferred for potential carotid
   stenting. On admission [**2174-9-25**], also found to have CHF on exam. This
   AM pt with an episode of unresponsiveness and question of convulsions
   that lasted a few minutes with several minutes of confusion post event.
   Transferred to CCU for monitoring.
   91M with bilateral carotid stenosis transferred for potential carotid
   stenting, transferred to CCU after unresponsive episode. Episode likely
   [**1-17**] transient cerebral hypoxia, although etiology is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] signs
   of worsening volume overload, COPD exacerbation. Has had LLL
   atelectasis on [**9-14**] CT but this may have progressed.
   -chest PT for lung collapse
   -cont diuresis for volume overload (goal -1L)
   -cont nebs for copd
   -coumadin on hold, will start heparin when INR <2
   -NPO at MN for potential carotid stenting, will need DNR/DNI reversed
   prior to procedure
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   -----------------
   .
   # Unresponsiveness: Most likely etioloigy at this time is LLL collapse
   leading to transient hypoxia in setting of bilateral carotid occlusive
   disease with supple/demand mismatch.  This may also represent a TIA
   from embolic source, although less likely.  From an obstructive lung
   disease standpoint, he appears to be at baseline with minimal wheezing
   and an ABG on 2L nc with appropriate pH and compensatory metabolic
   compensation in setting of chronic CO2 retention. Additionally, this
   may represent new seizure activity, although patient does not have a
   history of seizure activity. Prior to transfer to CCU, [**Hospital1 1276**] team
   already consulted neurology for possible TIA and/or seizure.
   - Chest PT, mucolytics
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Non-contrast CTH and CTA neck
   - Follow-up neurology recs
   - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
   .
   # Carotid stenosis: Patient transferred for carotid intervention.
   - As above, CTA neck to assess carotid and basilar flow.
   - Continue ASA 81 and atorvastatin.
   - Continue to hold coumadin, plan to start heparin in AM when INR<2
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient with known COPD on supplemental overnight O2,
   although this appears to be stable. Based on physical exam, admission
   CXR, and elevated BNP, he likely also has an element of volume overload
   secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  In addition, he was noted to
   have elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization in [**6-23**].
   Patient received lasix 40 IV this AM.  CXR following unresponsiveness
   now with LLL collapse.
   - Lasix prn with goal TBB -1000 cc/day. Check PM lytes.
   - Albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Chest PT and mucolytics as above.
   .
   # CAD: Patient not currently complaining of chest pain or anginal
   equivalents.  ECG with new TWI, although low suspicion for ACS at this
   time.
   - Continue metoprolol, ASA, statin, imdur.

   # Pump: Patient with preserved LVEF on last echo, although with signs
   of volume overload currently.
   - Continue metoprolol, lasix as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 91-year-old male with a medical history of CAD, COPD, PE on coumadin, mild AS, and DMII.
- He was admitted to the CCU for unresponsiveness and has had multiple episodes of unresponsiveness with unclear etiology.
- The patient has severe bilateral carotid stenosis and is being considered for carotid stenting.
- He also has CHF, PVD, DMII, TIA, and mild AS.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has decreased breath sounds at the left base and 1+ edema bilaterally.
- Imaging shows worsening aeration of the left lung, persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, and mild vascular congestion.
- Laboratory results indicate anemia and iron deficiency.
- The patient's respiratory status has been stable, but there is concern for volume overload and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- The patient's cardiac status is stable, but there are concerns about CAD and the need for continued anticoagulation for a possible PE.
- The patient's mental status remains a concern, and he is currently NPO pending improvement.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he will be reversed prior to interventions.

   a carotid doppler study which showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis.
   He was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for potential b/l carotid artery stenting.
   While on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 pt had episode of unresponsiveness w/ jerking motions
   which did not appear tonic-clonic.  Neurology was consulted and patient
   was transferred to CCU for further care.
   # Unresponsiveness: Neurology was consulted, and after speaking to the
   daughter, believes episode was most likely [**1-17**] anxiety attack and
   ?hyperventilation as patient reportedly has episodes of labored
   tachypnea at home.  Pt receives 0.5mg Ativan qAM at home, which he had
   not received.  Also possibly [**1-17**] Ativan withdrawal, despite small
   dose.  Also possible is LLL collapse seen on CXR leading to transient
   hypoxia in setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease with
   supply/demand mismatch.  TIA and seizure are unlikely.  From an
   obstructive lung disease standpoint, he appears to be at baseline with
   minimal wheezing and an ABG on 2L NC with appropriate pH and
   compensatory metabolic compensation in setting of chronic CO2
   retention.
   - Chest PT, mucolytics
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Continue prednisone burst and azithromycin for presumed COPD
   exacerbation as contributor
   - Now written for home Ativan qAM
   - Follow-up neurology recs
   - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
   .
   # Carotid stenosis: Patient transferred for carotid intervention, will
   discuss with attending whether pt is likely to have procedure today.
   - Continue ASA 81 and atorvastatin.
   - Continue to hold coumadin, continue heparin gtt (more for PE than for
   carotid artery stenosis)
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient with known COPD on supplemental overnight O2,
   although this appears to be stable. Based on physical exam, admission
   CXR, and elevated BNP, he likely also has an element of volume overload
   secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  In addition, he was noted to
   have elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization in [**6-23**].
   Patient received lasix 40 IV this AM.  CXR following unresponsiveness
   now with LLL collapse, written for repeat CXR today.
   - Lasix prn with goal TBB -1000 cc/day. Check PM lytes.
   - f/u CXR
   - Albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Chest PT and mucolytics as above.
   - ABG today for baseline, though likely will be similar to yesterdays
   ABG
   .
   # CAD: Patient with brief <1min complaint of chest pain this morning,
   no acute EKG changes, resolved spontaneously and resembles pt
s chronic
   chest/axillary pressure which he has when waking up in the mornings.
   Currently asymptomatic.  Admission ECG with new TWI, but low suspicion
   for ACS at this time.
   - Continue metoprolol, ASA, statin, imdur.
   .
   # Pump: Patient with preserved LVEF on last echo, although with signs
   of volume overload currently.
   - Continue metoprolol, lasix as above.
   .
   # Rhythmn: Sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear baseline, although patient received 1 unit PRBC at
   OSH prior to transfer for hemoglobin 10.  Patient with iron studies
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Guiac positive on admission
   but brown non-bloody stool, hct stable since admission.
   - Trend hct daily, transfuse for hct<21
   - Guaiac stools
   - Call PCP and assess colonoscopy history.
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism: Patient with history of PE in [**4-23**] on coumadin.
   Unclear based on review of records if there was an inciting event and
   need for continued anticoagulation. INR 1.4 today.
   - Until clarified, will cover with heparin gtt for INR<2, although
   patient may not require continued anticoagulation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an elderly male with a medical history of CAD, COPD, PE, mild AS, and DM2.
- He was admitted to the CCU for unresponsiveness and subsequently transferred to the ICU.
- The patient experienced multiple episodes of unresponsiveness with jerking motions, but neurology consultations determined these were likely anxiety attacks or hyperventilation.
- Imaging revealed severe bilateral carotid stenosis, and the patient was transferred to another hospital for potential carotid artery stenting.
- The patient's respiratory status is stable with known COPD, but there are concerns about volume overload and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- He received Lasix IV to manage this issue and has been written for repeat CXR.
- The patient also has anemia, which may be due to anemia of chronic disease.
- His INR is low, indicating a need for continued anticoagulation, especially considering his history of PE.
- The patient's diabetes management has been adjusted, and he is NPO pending possible procedures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Stroke or TIA due to severe bilateral carotid stenosis.
2. Respiratory failure due to worsening COPD exacerbation or volume overload.
3. Pneumonia due to dependent atelectasis from bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Cardiac complications such as"

   Assessment and Plan
 Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS (valve area
   1.2-1.9cm2), and DM 2 transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness.
   Patient presented to the OSH for an episode of unresponsiveness and had
   a carotid doppler study which showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis.
   He was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for potential b/l carotid artery stenting.
   While on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 pt had episode of unresponsiveness w/ jerking motions
   which did not appear tonic-clonic.  Neurology was consulted and patient
   was transferred to CCU for further care.
   # Unresponsiveness: Neurology was consulted, and after speaking to the
   daughter, believes episode was most likely [**1-17**] anxiety attack and
   ?hyperventilation as patient reportedly has episodes of labored
   tachypnea at home.  Pt receives 0.5mg Ativan qAM at home, which he had
   not received.  Also possibly [**1-17**] Ativan withdrawal, despite small

   # Carotid stenosis: Patient transferred for carotid intervention, will
   not have carotid artery stenosis stenting for now, will undergo lower
   extremity revascularization first.
   - Continue ASA 81 and atorvastatin.
   - Continue to hold coumadin, continue heparin gtt (more for PE than for
   carotid artery stenosis)
   - Follow-up with cards re: LE revascularization; Neuro does not
   recommend CEA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a previous pulmonary embolism. He presented to the hospital for unresponsiveness and had a carotid doppler study that showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis. He was transferred to the CCU for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Carotid stenosis: The patient has severe bilateral carotid stenosis, which puts him at risk for future cerebrovascular events such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD is poorly controlled, as evidenced by his wheezing, elevated BNP, and evidence of volume overload. He may be at risk for further exacerbations.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD and shows signs of volume overload, possibly due to heart failure. He may be at risk for cardiac events such as myocardial infarction.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE and is currently on heparin gtt. It is unclear if he requires continued anticoagulation.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease and requires monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusion if necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
 Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS (valve area
   1.2-1.9cm2), and DM 2 transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness.
   Patient presented to the OSH for an episode of unresponsiveness and had
   a carotid doppler study which showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis.
   He was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for potential b/l carotid artery stenting.
   While on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 pt had episode of unresponsiveness w/ jerking motions
   which did not appear tonic-clonic.  Neurology was consulted and patient
   was transferred to CCU for further care.
   # Unresponsiveness: Neurology was consulted, and after speaking to the
   daughter, believes episode was most likely [**1-17**] anxiety attack and
   ?hyperventilation as patient reportedly has episodes of labored
   tachypnea at home.  Pt receives 0.5mg Ativan qAM at home, which he had
   not received.  Also possibly [**1-17**] Ativan withdrawal, despite small
   dose.  Also possible is LLL collapse seen on CXR leading to transient
   hypoxia in setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease with
   supply/demand mismatch.  TIA and seizure are unlikely.  From an
   obstructive lung disease standpoint, he appears to be at baseline with
   minimal wheezing and an ABG on 2L NC with appropriate pH and
   compensatory metabolic compensation in setting of chronic CO2
   retention.
   - Chest PT, mucolytics
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Continue prednisone burst and azithromycin for presumed COPD
   exacerbation as contributor
   - Continue home Ativan qAM
   - Follow-up neurology recs
   - f/u EEG results, neuro recs
   - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
   .
   # Carotid stenosis: Patient transferred for carotid intervention, will
   not have carotid artery stenosis stenting for now, will undergo lower
   extremity revascularization first.
   - Continue ASA 81 and atorvastatin.
   - Continue to hold coumadin, continue heparin gtt (more for PE than for
   carotid artery stenosis)
   - Follow-up with cards re: LE revascularization; Neuro does not
   recommend CEA.
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient with known COPD on supplemental overnight O2,
   although this appears to be stable. Based on physical exam, admission
   CXR, and elevated BNP, he likely also has an element of volume overload
   secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  In addition, he was noted to
   have elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization in [**6-23**].
   Patient received lasix 40 IV this AM.  CXR following unresponsiveness
   now with LLL collapse, written for repeat CXR today.
   - Lasix prn with goal even to -500cc today.
   - Albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Chest PT and mucolytics as above
   .
   # CAD: Patient with brief <1min complaint of chest pain this morning,
   no acute EKG changes, resolved spontaneously and resembles pt
s chronic
   chest/axillary pressure which he has when waking up in the mornings.
   Currently asymptomatic.  Admission ECG with new TWI, but low suspicion
   for ACS at this time.
   - Continue metoprolol, ASA, statin, imdur.
   .
   # Pump: Patient with preserved LVEF on last echo, although with signs
   of volume overload currently.
   - Continue metoprolol, lasix as above for goal even to -500cc today.
   .
   # Rhythmn: Sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear baseline, although patient received 1 unit PRBC at
   OSH prior to transfer for hemoglobin 10.  Patient with iron studies
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Guiac positive on admission
   but brown non-bloody stool, hct stable since admission.
   - Trend hct daily, transfuse for hct<21
   - Guaiac stools
   - Call PCP and assess colonoscopy history.
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism: Patient with history of PE in [**4-23**] on coumadin.
   Unclear based on review of records if there was an inciting event and
   need for continued anticoagulation. INR 1.4 today.
   - Until clarified, will cover with heparin gtt for INR<2, although
   patient may not require continued anticoagulation.
   - Hold coumadin until procedure plan clarified
   .
   # DM: Hold home Glipizide. Continue HISS and accuchecks.
   .
   # 1 bottle + peptostrepto on OSH culture
   - f/u OSH sensitivities
   .
   FEN: NPO for now pending possible procedure . Replete electrolytes prn.
   Speech/swallow eval.
   Access: PIV
   PPx: Heparin gtt.
   Code: DNR/DNI confirmed on admission.  Will plan on reversing prior to
   interventions.

   CCU ATTENDING  PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the progress note.  The documented physical examination is
   consistent with my examination.
   History:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
s note.
   Physical Examination:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
s note.
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man who was
   transferred for evaluation of his bilateral carotid stenosis, right
   lower extremity with ulceration, and altered mental status.   There may
   have been a possible underlying seizure activity.  His CTA shows
   bilateral 80% stenosis but there was no clear indication for
   treatment.   We will evaluate his lower extremity peripheral vessel
   today with an eye toward revascularization.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has known COPD and is on supplemental overnight oxygen. There is evidence of volume overload secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema, as indicated by elevated BNP and filling pressures on cardiac catheterization. The patient also has mild wheezing on examination. These factors increase the risk of respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, or exacerbation of COPD.

2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and presents with chest pain. Although the EKG changes were non-specific, the patient's symptoms resemble his chronic chest/axillary pressure. The patient is currently asymptomatic but remains at risk for further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

3. Neurological Complications: The patient experienced episodes of unresponsiveness with jerking motions, which may suggest seizures. However, the neurology team believes these episodes were likely anxiety attacks, hyperventilation, or Ativan withdrawal. The patient also has severe bilateral carotid stenosis, which increases the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes.

4. Anemia: The patient has signs consistent with anemia of chronic disease, although his hemoglobin levels have been relatively stable since admission. Close monitoring of the patient's hematocrit (H"

   CT head [**9-28**]
   PFI: No acute hemorrhage, mass effect, or territorial vascular
   infarction.
   Region of encephalomalacia within the right occipital lobe consistent
   with
   prior infarct. Scattered punctate calcifications throughout the right
   hemisphere consistent with prior granulomatous disease. Scattered
   calcifications within the basal ganglia bilaterally.
   Assessment and Plan
 [**Age over 90 **] Male with PMH of  CAD, COPD admitted from OSH after episode of
   unresponsiveness and slurred speech. CT showed severe bilateral carotid
   stenosis, transferred here [**2174-9-25**] for potential carotid stenting.  He
   has COPD and uses 2L O2  at night; he has a HX of PE  while on coumadin
   in 5/[**2173**].  Also  PMH of mild AS and known foot ulcer.
   On [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 on [**9-27**] pt had episode of unresponsiveness, and ? SZ vs TIA-
   came to CCU  for monitoring. Neuro is following and currently recs are
   for no stenting of carotids,  DR.  [**Last Name (STitle) 4235**] is considering
   revascularization for R foot ulcer that may be infected. Pt has had
   positive BC at OSH , gram positive, cultures here [**9-27**] pending, he is
   on Unasyn and azithromycin. In CCU he is being treated with Prednisone
   for COPD flare and Lasix for CHF.  He has LLL atelectasis by CXR.
   Last night at change of shift  Pt became very SOB and developed CP. He
   inadvertently pulled out his IV, and was anxious.He developed chest
   pain, and was treated with Nito SL, IV morphine, IV furosemide,  po
   lorazepam. Chest pain and SOB did
   Resolve with measures, although his respiratory staus remains tenuous
   team states they will eval and give more lasix at 0600.
   Pt diuresed quite a bit to lasix and was 1000 ML negative at
   midnight.   Pt was able to fall asleep by 0100 am and is arousable but
   sleeping all night when not stimulated. He is on high dose prednisone
   and his glucose is very high and we are treating him carefully as he is
   NPO.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial septal defect (AS), and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after presenting with unresponsiveness and slurred speech. 

The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments during his stay in the ICU. He has been given Lasix for congestive heart failure, nitro and morphine for chest pain, lorazepam for anxiety, and antibiotics for a potential infection. He is also on supplemental oxygen due to his COPD.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/47 mmHg to 95/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His blood glucose levels are high, indicating possible poorly controlled diabetes.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, slightly elevated white blood cell count, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal severe bilateral carotid stenosis, prior infarcts, and calcifications in the right hemisphere of the brain"

   Assessment and Plan
 [**Age over 90 **] Male with PMH of  CAD, COPD admitted from OSH after episode of
   unresponsiveness and slurred speech. CT showed severe bilateral carotid
   stenosis, transferred here [**2174-9-25**] for potential carotid stenting.  He
   has COPD and uses 2L O2  at night; he has a HX of PE  while on coumadin
   in 5/[**2173**].  Also  PMH of mild AS and known foot ulcer.
   On [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 on [**9-27**] pt had episode of unresponsiveness, and ? SZ vs TIA-
   came to CCU  for monitoring. Neuro is following and currently recs are
   for no stenting of carotids,  DR.  [**Last Name (STitle) 4235**] is considering
   revascularization for R foot ulcer that may be infected. Pt has had
   positive BC at OSH , gram positive, cultures here [**9-27**] pending, he is
   on Unasyn and azithromycin. In CCU he is being treated with Prednisone
   for COPD flare and Lasix for CHF.  He has LLL atelectasis by CXR.
   Last night at change of shift  Pt became very SOB and developed CP. He
   inadvertently pulled out his IV, and was anxious.He developed chest
   pain, and was treated with Nito SL, IV morphine, IV furosemide,  po
   lorazepam. Chest pain and SOB did
   Resolve with measures, although his respiratory staus remains tenuous
   team states they will eval and give more lasix at 0600.
   Pt diuresed quite a bit to lasix and was 1000 ML negative at
   midnight.   Pt was able to fall asleep by 0100 am and is arousable but
   sleeping all night when not stimulated. He is on high dose prednisone
   and his glucose is very high and we are treating him carefully as he is
   NPO.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS (valve area
   1.2-1.9cm2), and DM 2 transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness.
   Patient presented to the OSH for an episode of unresponsiveness and had
   a carotid doppler study which showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis.
   He was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for potential b/l carotid artery stenting.
   While on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 pt had episode of unresponsiveness w/ jerking motions
   which did not appear tonic-clonic.  Neurology was consulted and patient
   was transferred to CCU for further care.
   # Unresponsiveness: Neurology was consulted, and after speaking to the
   daughter, believes episode was most likely [**1-17**] anxiety attack and
   ?hyperventilation as patient reportedly has episodes of labored
   tachypnea at home.  Pt receives 0.5mg Ativan qAM at home, which he had
   not received.  Also possibly [**1-17**] Ativan withdrawal, despite small
   dose.  Also possible is LLL collapse seen on CXR leading to transient
   hypoxia in setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease with
   supply/demand mismatch.  TIA and seizure are unlikely.  From an
   obstructive lung disease standpoint, he appears to be at baseline with
   minimal wheezing and an ABG on 2L NC with appropriate pH and
   compensatory metabolic compensation in setting of chronic CO2
   retention.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS (valve area
   1.2-1.9cm2), and DM 2 transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness.
   Patient presented to the OSH for an episode of unresponsiveness and had
   a carotid doppler study which showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis.
   He was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for potential b/l carotid artery stenting.
   While on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 pt had episode of unresponsiveness w/ jerking motions
   which did not appear tonic-clonic.  Neurology was consulted and patient
   was transferred to CCU for further care. While in CCU, decision was
   made not to surgically act upon carotid stenoses (based upon cardiology
   & neurology decision); patient
s right lower extremity had
   revascularization procedure (laser angioplasty) done on [**9-29**], doing
   well since then.
   # Unresponsiveness: Neurology was consulted, and after speaking to the
   daughter, believes episode was most likely [**1-17**] anxiety attack and
   ?hyperventilation as patient reportedly has episodes of labored
   tachypnea at home.  Pt receives 0.5mg Ativan qAM at home, which he had
   not received.  Also possibly [**1-17**] Ativan withdrawal, despite small
   dose.  Also possible is LLL collapse seen on CXR leading to transient
   hypoxia in setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease with
   supply/demand mismatch.  TIA and seizure are unlikely.  From an
   obstructive lung disease standpoint, he appears to be at baseline. No
   further episodes of unresponsiveness while here in the CCU.
   - Chest PT, mucolytics
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - Continue prednisone burst and azithromycin (5 days) for presumed COPD
   exacerbation as contributor
   - Continue Unasyn (but convert to PO augmentin), for 7 day course,
   started on [**9-27**]
   - Continue home Ativan qAM
   - f/u EEG results, neuro recs
   - keep SpO2 in low 90s, so as not to reduce respiratory drive and cause
   CO2 narcosis
   - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
   .
   # Carotid stenosis: Patient transferred for carotid intervention, will
   not have carotid artery stenosis stenting for now, will undergo lower
   extremity revascularization first.
   - Continue ASA 81 and atorvastatin.
   - Continue heparin gtt (more for PE than for carotid artery stenosis);
   now post-procedure, restart coumadin at home dose
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient with known COPD on supplemental overnight O2,
   although this appears to be stable. Based on physical exam, admission
   CXR, and elevated BNP, he likely also has an element of volume overload
   secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  In addition, he was noted to
   have elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization in [**6-23**].
   - Lasix prn with goal even to -500cc today.
   - Albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Chest PT and mucolytics as above
   - Goal SpO2 in the low 90s, d/t history of COPD
   .
   # CAD: Patient with brief <1min complaint of chest pain this morning,
   no acute EKG changes, resolved spontaneously and resembles pt
s chronic
   chest/axillary pressure which he has when waking up in the mornings.
   Currently asymptomatic.  Admission ECG with new TWI, but low suspicion
   for ACS at this time. Patient continues with typical awakening chest
   pain.
   - Continue metoprolol, ASA, statin, imdur.
   .
   # Pump: Patient with preserved LVEF on last echo, although with signs
   of volume overload currently.
   - Continue metoprolol, lasix as above for goal even to -500cc today.
   .
   # Rhythmn: Sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear baseline, although patient received 1 unit PRBC at
   OSH prior to transfer for hemoglobin 10.  Patient with iron studies
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Guiac positive on admission
   but brown non-bloody stool, hct stable since admission except for 2.5
   point drop since yesterday
s procedure
appropriate.
   - Trend Hct daily, transfuse for hct<21
   - Plan for outpatient follow-up of colonoscopy history d/t anemia
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism: Patient with history of PE in [**4-23**] on coumadin.
   Unclear based on review of records if there was an inciting event and
   need for continued anticoagulation. INR 1.3 today
   - Patient with PE less than 6 months ago, so must anticoagulate to goal
   INR [**1-18**] at least through [**2174-10-16**]
   - Now post-procedure, can restart coumadin at home dose, and bridge
   with heparin gtt
   .
   # DM: Hold home Glipizide. Continue HISS and accuchecks.
   .
   # 1 bottle + peptostrepto on OSH culture
   - f/u OSH sensitivities
   - treat with augmentin po (switch from IV Unasyn) for 7 day course
   total, started with day #1 on [**9-27**]/9
   .
   FEN: Diabetic, cardiac diet. Replete electrolytes prn.
   Access: 1 PIV; call IV team for hope for more access. Change IV
   antibiotics to PO antibiotics.
   PPx: Heparin gtt, restarting coumadin at home dose.
   Code: DNR/DNI confirmed on admission.  Will plan on reversing prior to
   interventions.

   CCU ATTENDING  PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the progress note.  The documented physical examination is
   consistent with my examination.

s note.
   Medical Decision Making:   Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man who was
   transferred for evaluation of his bilateral carotid stenosis, right
   lower extremity with ulceration, and altered mental status.   There may
   have been a possible underlying seizure activity.  His CTA shows
   bilateral 80% stenosis but there was no clear indication for
   treatment.
   He underwent laser angioplasty of the right SFA yesterday
 he has one
   vessel runoff to the foot.  He remains cheerful and in no distress.
   We will plan transfer back to the [**Hospital1 **] later this PM.
   A total of 35 minutes were spent on this visit today with > 50% spend
   counseling and coordinating care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history significant for coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), mild aortic stenosis (AS), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for unresponsiveness and had a carotid Doppler study that showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis.

The patient underwent lower extremity revascularization procedure (laser angioplasty) on 9/29, which was done well since then. The patient also experienced an episode of unresponsiveness with jerking motions, which was likely due to anxiety or hyperventilation. TIA and seizure are unlikely.

The patient's respiratory status appears to be stable, with known COPD and supplemental overnight oxygen. There is an indication of volume overload secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The goal is to keep the patient's SpO2 in the low 90s to avoid reducing respiratory drive and causing CO2 narcosis.

The patient's cardiac status shows preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on the last echocardiogram, although with signs of volume overload currently. The patient continues with metoprolol, lasix, and other cardiac medications.

Regarding the patient's anemia, it is unclear if it is a baseline condition or related to recent blood loss during"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), mild aortic stenosis (AS), and diabetes mellitus type 2. He was admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness and had severe bilateral carotid stenosis. The patient underwent a revascularization procedure on his right lower extremity and is currently on heparin gtt. He has been experiencing leg pain, which is tolerable. His Hct dropped 2.5 points since yesterday, believed to be due to procedural blood loss. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Unresponsiveness: Neurology was consulted, and the episodes were likely anxiety attacks and hyperventilation. The patient receives 0.5mg Ativan qAM at home, which he had not received. Possible is LLL collapse seen on CXR leading to transient hypoxia in setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease with supply/demand mismatch. TIA and seizure are unlikely. No further episodes of unresponsiveness while here in the CCU.
- Chest PT, mucolytics
- Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
- Continue prednisone burst and azithromycin for presumed COPD exacerbation as contributor
- Continue home Ativan qAM
- f/u EEG results, neuro recs
- Continue ASA 81 mg daily

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS (valve area
   1.2-1.9cm2), and DM 2 transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness.
   Patient presented to the OSH for an episode of unresponsiveness and had
   a carotid doppler study which showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis.
   He was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for potential b/l carotid artery stenting.
   While on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 pt had episode of unresponsiveness w/ jerking motions
   which did not appear tonic-clonic.  Neurology was consulted and patient
   was transferred to CCU for further care. While in CCU, decision was
   made not to surgically act upon carotid stenoses (based upon cardiology
   & neurology decision); patient
s right lower extremity had
   revascularization procedure (laser angioplasty) done on [**9-29**], doing
   well since then.
   # Unresponsiveness: Neurology was consulted, and after speaking to the
   daughter, believes episode was most likely [**1-17**] anxiety attack and
   ?hyperventilation as patient reportedly has episodes of labored
   tachypnea at home.  Pt receives 0.5mg Ativan qAM at home, which he had
   not received.  Also possibly [**1-17**] Ativan withdrawal, despite small
   dose.  Also possible is LLL collapse seen on CXR leading to transient
   hypoxia in setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease with
   supply/demand mismatch.  TIA and seizure are unlikely.  From an
   obstructive lung disease standpoint, he appears to be at baseline. No
   further episodes of unresponsiveness while here in the CCU.
   - Chest PT, mucolytics
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - Continue prednisone burst and azithromycin (5 days) for presumed COPD
   exacerbation as contributor
   - Continue Unasyn (but convert to PO augmentin), for 7 day course,
   started on [**9-27**]
   - Continue home Ativan qAM
   - f/u EEG results, neuro recs
   - keep SpO2 in low 90s, so as not to reduce respiratory drive and cause
   CO2 narcosis
   - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
   .
   # Carotid stenosis: Patient transferred for carotid intervention, will
   not have carotid artery stenosis stenting for now, will undergo lower
   extremity revascularization first.
   - Continue ASA 81 and atorvastatin.
   - Continue heparin gtt (more for PE than for carotid artery stenosis);
   now post-procedure, restart coumadin at home dose
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient with known COPD on supplemental overnight O2,
   although this appears to be stable. Based on physical exam, admission
   CXR, and elevated BNP, he likely also has an element of volume overload
   secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  In addition, he was noted to
   have elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization in [**6-23**].
   - Lasix prn with goal even to -500cc today.
   - Albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Chest PT and mucolytics as above
   - Goal SpO2 in the low 90s, d/t history of COPD
   .
   # CAD: Patient with brief <1min complaint of chest pain this morning,
   no acute EKG changes, resolved spontaneously and resembles pt
s chronic
   chest/axillary pressure which he has when waking up in the mornings.
   Currently asymptomatic.  Admission ECG with new TWI, but low suspicion
   for ACS at this time. Patient continues with typical awakening chest
   pain.
   - Continue metoprolol, ASA, statin, imdur.
   .
   # Pump: Patient with preserved LVEF on last echo, although with signs
   of volume overload currently.
   - Continue metoprolol, lasix as above for goal even to -500cc today.
   .
   # Rhythmn: Sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear baseline, although patient received 1 unit PRBC at
   OSH prior to transfer for hemoglobin 10.  Patient with iron studies
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Guiac positive on admission
   but brown non-bloody stool, hct stable since admission except for 2.5
   point drop since yesterday
s procedure
appropriate.
   - Trend Hct daily, transfuse for hct<21
   - Plan for outpatient follow-up of colonoscopy history d/t anemia
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism: Patient with history of PE in [**4-23**] on coumadin.
   Unclear based on review of records if there was an inciting event and
   need for continued anticoagulation. INR 1.3 today
   - Patient with PE less than 6 months ago, so must anticoagulate to goal
   INR [**1-18**] at least through [**2174-10-16**]
   - Now post-procedure, can restart coumadin at home dose, and bridge
   with heparin gtt
   .
   # DM: Hold home Glipizide. Continue HISS and accuchecks.
   .
   # 1 bottle + peptostrepto on OSH culture
   - f/u OSH sensitivities
   - treat with augmentin po (switch from IV Unasyn) for 7 day course
   total, started with day #1 on [**9-27**]/9
   .
   FEN: Diabetic, cardiac diet. Replete electrolytes prn.
   Access: 1 PIV; call IV team for hope for more access. Change IV
   antibiotics to PO antibiotics.
   PPx: Heparin gtt, restarting coumadin at home dose.
   Code: DNR/DNI confirmed on admission.  Will plan on reversing prior to
   interventions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can arise from several conditions:

1. Carotid stenosis: The patient has severe bilateral carotid stenosis, which increases the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), strokes, or other neurological events.

2. COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is experiencing an exacerbation, which can lead to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.

3. Cardiac disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and may be at risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), angina, or heart failure.

4. Pulmonary edema: The patient shows signs of volume overload and elevated filling pressures, indicating possible cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which can compromise respiratory function.

5. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a previous history of PE and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. There is a risk of recurrence if anticoagulation is not properly managed.

7. Infection: The patient has a positive culture for bacteria, indicating a possible infection that needs to be treated.

8. Medication-related issues: The patient is on multiple medications, including Ativan, which may contribute to sedation or"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS (valve area
   1.2-1.9cm2), and DM 2 transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness, s/p
   LE re-vascularization procedure.
   # Unresponsiveness: Neurology was consulted, and after speaking to the
   daughter, believes episode was most likely [**1-17**] anxiety attack and
   ?hyperventilation as patient reportedly has episodes of labored
   tachypnea at home.  Pt receives 0.5mg Ativan qAM at home, which he had
   not received.  Also possible is LLL collapse seen on CXR leading to
   transient hypoxia in setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease
   with supply/demand mismatch, however stenting procedure deferred for
   the time being given his improvement and the risk of the procedure in
   this gentleman.  TIA and seizure are unlikely.  From an obstructive
   lung disease standpoint, he appears to be at baseline. No further
   episodes of unresponsiveness while here in the CCU.
   - Chest PT, mucolytics
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial septal defect (AS), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM), and lower extremity (LE) revascularization procedure. He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for unresponsiveness, which was likely due to anxiety or hyperventilation. Other possible causes include transient hypoxia from LE collapse or a supply/demand mismatch in the setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease. The patient has been improving without further episodes of unresponsiveness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Hypoventilation due to obesity and elevated hemidiaphragm.
   - Goal SpO2 in the low 90s to avoid reducing respiratory drive and causing CO2 narcosis.
   - Volume overload and restrictive lung disease at baseline.

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Stable CAD with no new chest pain or shortness of breath.
   - Continue metoprolol, ASA, and statin.

3. Pulmonary Embolism:
   - Unclear if there was an inciting event for the PE.
   - Continue anticoagulation with goal INR 1.4-2.8 through 10/16/2174.
   - Bridge with heparin gtt now that the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3752**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman wiht a PMH significant for
   CAD, COPD on 2L nc at night, PE on coumadin, mild AS (valve area
   1.2-1.9cm2), and DM 2 transferred to the CCU for unresponsiveness.
   Patient presented to the OSH for an episode of unresponsiveness and had
   a carotid doppler study which showed severe bilateral carotid stenosis.
   He was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for potential b/l carotid artery stenting.
   While on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 pt had episode of unresponsiveness w/ jerking motions
   which did not appear tonic-clonic.  Neurology was consulted and patient
   was transferred to CCU for further care. While in CCU, decision was
   made not to surgically act upon carotid stenoses (based upon cardiology
   & neurology decision); patient
s right lower extremity had
   revascularization procedure (laser angioplasty) done on [**9-29**], doing
   well since then.
   # Unresponsiveness: Neurology was consulted, and after speaking to the
   daughter, believes episode was most likely [**1-17**] anxiety attack and
   ?hyperventilation as patient reportedly has episodes of labored
   tachypnea at home.  Pt receives 0.5mg Ativan qAM at home, which he had
   not received.  Also possibly [**1-17**] Ativan withdrawal, despite small
   dose.  Also possible is LLL collapse seen on CXR leading to transient
   hypoxia in setting of bilateral carotid occlusive disease with
   supply/demand mismatch.  TIA and seizure are unlikely.  From an
   obstructive lung disease standpoint, he appears to be at baseline. No
   further episodes of unresponsiveness while here in the CCU.
   - Chest PT, mucolytics
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   - Continue prednisone burst and azithromycin (5 days) for presumed COPD
   exacerbation as contributor
   - Continue Unasyn (but convert to PO augmentin), for 7 day course,
   started on [**9-27**]
   - Continue home Ativan qAM
   - f/u EEG results, neuro recs
   - keep SpO2 in low 90s, so as not to reduce respiratory drive and cause
   CO2 narcosis
   - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
   .
   # Carotid stenosis: Patient transferred for carotid intervention, will
   not have carotid artery stenosis stenting for now, will undergo lower
   extremity revascularization first.
   - Continue ASA 81 and atorvastatin.
   - Continue heparin gtt (more for PE than for carotid artery stenosis);
   now post-procedure, restart coumadin at home dose
   .
   # Respiratory: Patient with known COPD on supplemental overnight O2,
   although this appears to be stable. Based on physical exam, admission
   CXR, and elevated BNP, he likely also has an element of volume overload
   secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.  In addition, he was noted to
   have elevated filling pressures on cardiac catheterization in [**6-23**].
   - Lasix prn with goal even to -500cc today.
   - Albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
   - Chest PT and mucolytics as above
   - Goal SpO2 in the low 90s, d/t history of COPD
   .
   # CAD: Patient with brief <1min complaint of chest pain this morning,
   no acute EKG changes, resolved spontaneously and resembles pt
s chronic
   chest/axillary pressure which he has when waking up in the mornings.
   Currently asymptomatic.  Admission ECG with new TWI, but low suspicion
   for ACS at this time. Patient continues with typical awakening chest
   pain.
   - Continue metoprolol, ASA, statin, imdur.
   .
   # Pump: Patient with preserved LVEF on last echo, although with signs
   of volume overload currently.
   - Continue metoprolol, lasix as above for goal even to -500cc today.
   .
   # Rhythmn: Sinus with 1:1 conduction.  Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Anemia: Unclear baseline, although patient received 1 unit PRBC at
   OSH prior to transfer for hemoglobin 10.  Patient with iron studies
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Guiac positive on admission
   but brown non-bloody stool, hct stable since admission except for 2.5
   point drop since yesterday
s procedure
appropriate.
   - Trend Hct daily, transfuse for hct<21
   - Plan for outpatient follow-up of colonoscopy history d/t anemia
   .
   # Pulmonary embolism: Patient with history of PE in [**4-23**] on coumadin.
   Unclear based on review of records if there was an inciting event and
   need for continued anticoagulation. INR 1.3 today
   - Patient with PE less than 6 months ago, so must anticoagulate to goal
   INR [**1-18**] at least through [**2174-10-16**]
   - Now post-procedure, can restart coumadin at home dose, and bridge
   with heparin gtt
   .
   # DM: Hold home Glipizide. Continue HISS and accuchecks.
   .
   # 1 bottle + peptostrepto on OSH culture
   - f/u OSH sensitivities
   - treat with augmentin po (switch from IV Unasyn) for 7 day course
   total, started with day #1 on [**9-27**]/9
   .
   FEN: Diabetic, cardiac diet. Replete electrolytes prn.
   Access: 1 PIV; call IV team for hope for more access. Change IV
   antibiotics to PO antibiotics.
   PPx: Heparin gtt, restarting coumadin at home dose.
   Code: DNR/DNI confirmed on admission.  Will plan on reversing prior to
   interventions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and a previous pulmonary embolism (PE). He presented to the hospital for an episode of unresponsiveness and was found to have severe bilateral carotid stenosis. The patient underwent a revascularization procedure for PAD and was transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) for further care. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Unresponsiveness: Neurology consulted, believed to be anxiety attack or hyperventilation. No further episodes of unresponsiveness while in the CCU.
- Continue Ativan qAM
- Follow-up EEG results
- Neurology recommendations

2. Carotid stenosis: Will not have carotid artery stenting for now, but will undergo lower extremity revascularization first.
- Continue ASA 81 and atorvastatin
- Continue heparin gtt (more for PE than for carotid artery stenosis); now post-procedure, restart coumadin at home dose

3. Respiratory: Patient with known COPD on supplemental overnight O2, stable. Likely also has an element of volume overload secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- Lasix prn with goal even to -500cc today.
- Albuterol and"
