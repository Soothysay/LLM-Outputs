","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and new onset seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia (PNA) after being transferred from another hospital for a clogged G-tube. The patient developed respiratory distress, was intubated, and placed on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, and he has a history of prior myocardial infarction, focal wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying COPD and likely chronic retention of carbon dioxide. He developed acute respiratory distress and was intubated due to severe hypoxia and hypercapnia. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia (Asp PNA) given the presence of 4+ Gram-negative rods on gram stain of secretions.
2. Cardiac Failure: The patient has a history of CAD, prior myocardial infarction, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. He may have acute on chronic pleural effusions suggestive of heart failure. There is also a concern for cardiogenic shock due to labile blood pressure and the use of dopamine.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and there are concerns about sepsis versus the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and new onset seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia (PNA) due to respiratory distress and clogged G-tube. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute on chronic respiratory distress, and chronic pleural effusions likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF). He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The presence of gram-negative rods on the gram stain of sputum suggests the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.
2. CHF exacerbation: The patient's underlying CAD and dysphagia may contribute to chronic pleural effusions, which have worsened acutely, indicating possible CHF exacerbation.
3. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizures, and the recent apnea episode could be related to seizure activity.
4. Hypotension: The patient's labile blood pressure may be due to sepsis or the effect of sedation.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's use of aspirin raises the concern for GIB, especially considering his history of GIB.
6. Diuretic-induced electrolyte imbalance: The attempted gentle diuresis with Lasix may lead to electrolyte imbalances.
7. Ventilator-associated"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and a new onset seizure disorder. He was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for a clogged gastrointestinal (GI) tube and is now experiencing respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure and is suspected to have pneumonia (PNA), possibly due to aspiration.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 157/59 mmHg to 100/39 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Blood cultures are pending. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 56 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 213.

The patient's physical examination reveals the presence of bilateral pleural effusions, likely chronic with acute worsening on the right side, possibly due to congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's EKGs are being"

   80 y/o M with PMHx of CAD, COPD, dysphagia and new onset seizure d/o
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 25**] for clogged G-tube now found to be in
   respiratory distress and admitted to ICU for possible PNA.

   # Respiratory Failure: Pt with underlying COPD and likely some degree
   of chronic retention with bicarb of 43 and prior ABGs showing CO2 in
   60s.  Bilateral pleural effusions appear chronic with acute worsening
   on right most likely due to CHF given diminished BS. Developed apnea
   yesterday, perhaps in setting of rapidly rising CO2, also with lots of
   secretions c gram stain showing 4+GNRs. Most likely this is aspiration
   pna plus underlying CHF c chronic effusions.  Currently intubated.
   apneic on rsbi this am.
   - trend ABGs
   - wean vent prn. likely pt lives c pCO2 in mid 60s.
   - continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for now given possibility of Asp PNA
   - f/u am CXR
   - continue Alb/Atrovent nebs & fluticasone
   - f/u blood Cx, send sputum prn
   -attempt gentle diuresis c lasix 40 IV boluses did recieve bolus
   peri-intubation in setting of hypotension
   -will have neuro evaluate for ? seizure as etiology of apnea

   # CAD: Pt reports h/o prior MI followed by cardiology, echo with focal
   WMA, valve disease, LVEF 40% who is currently denying chest pain though
   reports progressive SOB over last 3 days. First set of CE negative and
   EKGs at baseline.  Suspect acute on chronic pleural effusions [**1-5**] heart
   failure.
   - f/u serial EKGs
   - cardiac enzymes reassuring
   - continue Simvastatin, holding lisinopril in setting of hypotension
   - Aspirin 325mg x 1 (unclear why not on ASA at baseline)
   - attempt gentle diuresis

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and new-onset seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia (PNA) due to respiratory distress and a clogged G-tube.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 500 mL, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His blood gases show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 56 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 213, indicating adequate oxygenation but hypercapnia.
- Acute on chronic pleural effusions likely secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF).
- Presence of gram-negative rods on gram stain from sputum culture.
- Hypotension possibly due to sepsis or adverse effects of sedation. Currently on dopamine at 6 mcg/kg/min.
- Foley catheter in place, holding tamsulosin for BPH.
- Valproic acid for seizure disorder.
- NPO status with attempted diuresis using lasix.
- Replete electrolytes.
- Midline and arterial lines in place.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and a recent onset seizure disorder. The patient was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for respiratory distress and was intubated due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory status: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- Cardiovascular status: The patient has labile blood pressures and is on dopamine as a pressor.
- Neurological status: The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. Neurological examination reveals no acute distress, but the patient does not follow simple commands and responds to not-assessed stimuli.
- Laboratory results: The patient's blood tests show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, troponin T level, and lactate level. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose levels are within normal range. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH with normal oxygenation.
- Imaging: A chest X-ray shows bilateral effusions and right lower lobe infiltrate.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and a new onset seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and possible pneumonia. The patient has been intubated due to an apneic episode of unclear etiology. He has chronic bilateral pleural effusions, likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF), and developed acute respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying COPD and likely some degree of chronic CO2 retention. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and his ABG results indicate hypercarbia. There is a possibility of aspiration pneumonia due to the presence of 4+ GNRs on gram stain from secretions. Chronic pleural effusions appear to be worsening, possibly due to acute CHF.

2. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of CAD and prior myocardial infarction. He has focal wall motion abnormalities (WMA) on echo and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. His symptoms of progressive shortness of breath and negative cardiac enzymes suggest acute on chronic heart failure. 

3. Hypotension: The patient has labile blood pressure, which may be due to sepsis or the effect of sedation. Cardiogenic shock is less likely as no clear"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and new-onset seizure disorder. He was transferred from another hospital for a clogged G-tube and is now in respiratory distress, admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia (PNA). The patient developed apnea yesterday and required intubation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/45 mmHg to 183/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient has diffuse bilateral wheezing in the anterior lung fields, right-sided heart failure (RRR), and a holosystolic murmur. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with positive bowel sounds (BS). No pedal edema is present.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 10.1 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 8.9 g/dL, normal platelet count (Plt) at 165 K/uL, and elevated lactate level at 0.5 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and a new onset seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and possible pneumonia (PNA). The patient developed apnea, became hypotensive, and required intubation. He has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic pleural effusions. His current medications include Valproic Acid for seizure disorder, Simvastatin, and aspirin. The patient has a Foley catheter in place and is currently NPO.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and likely some degree of chronic retention with bicarbonate levels of 43 and prior ABGs showing CO2 in the 60s indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. The bilateral pleural effusions appear chronic with acute worsening on the right, most likely due to CHF given diminished breath sounds. The patient developed apnea yesterday, perhaps in the setting of rapidly rising CO2, also with lots of secretions showing 4+GNRs on gram stain. This suggests aspiration PNA plus underlying CHF with chronic effusions.
2. Chronic Pleural Effusions: The patient's history of CAD, focal wall motion abnormality (WMA), valve disease, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%"

   substantial hypercarbia, but with near-normal pH - likely is near his
   baseline.
   -off Levophed and normotensive, however later in the day was started on
   Dopamine due to decreased BP.
   -Lasix 40 mg given in am, with good urine output.  40 mg given in

   -acetezolamide given to waste bicarb, stimulate resp. drive.
   -Neuro recs:
   1. Neurology West Consult Service will follow.
   2. His family need to understand the severity of his symptoms, as
   he will most likely need a trach.
   3. Please check an am Depakote level, before the am dose.
   4. A sleep study as an outpatient
   5. His records from the VA regarding his pulmonary issues and his
   last FEV1 would be useful.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and new-onset seizure disorder. He was transferred from another hospital for a clogged G-tube and is now in respiratory distress, admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia (PNA). The patient developed apnea, likely due to aspiration pneumonia and underlying congestive heart failure (CHF), with chronic pleural effusions showing acute worsening on the right side. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and chronic retention of carbon dioxide (CO2) have led to acute respiratory failure. The high levels of CO2 in his blood indicate inadequate ventilation. The presence of bilateral pleural effusions suggests chronic fluid accumulation in the lungs, which may be related to CHF.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's gram stain of sputum shows gram-negative rods (GNRs), indicating a possible bacterial infection caused by aspiration of oropharyngeal contents into the lungs.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's history of prior MI, focal wall motion abnormality (WMA), valve disease, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 40% suggest chronic heart failure. The presence of acute-on-chronic"

   RBR responsive to Lopressor, currently in NSR.  Patient has hx of prior
   MI with echo showing FWMA, valve disease and LVEF of 40%.  ECG now
   unchanged from prior.  Patient does not appear volume overloaded.
   - consider CE if persists in setting of prior MI, consider TSH for new
   onset  afib in hospitalized patient.
   - will continue ASA 81 mg PO daily
   - follow and replete electrolytes PRN
   - will email PCP if persists regarding risks and benefits of long term
   anticoagulation, CHADS2 score is 3
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology as sepsis with underlying pneumonia vs.
   prior effect of sedation
   - pressors discontinued [**8-17**], will continue to monitor

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and new onset seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient is extubated with good oxygenation on high flow nasal cannula. He has a clogged G-tube, which was found during his transfer from another hospital. The patient's current medications include Valproic Acid for seizure disorder, ASA for atrial fibrillation, and other prophylactic medications.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 beats per minute, hypotension with blood pressure ranging from 99/49 to 165/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow nasal cannula. His temperature is slightly elevated at 36.9°C.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB/RVR), which is responsive to Lopressor. He has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) with an ejection fraction of 40%. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no changes from prior and the patient does not appear volume overloaded. The plan includes considering cardioversion (CE) if AFIB persists, especially in the setting of prior MI. A thyroid-stimulating"

   Assessment and Plan:
   80 y/o M with PMHx of CAD, COPD, dysphagia and new onset seizure d/o
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 25**] for clogged G-tube now found to be in
   respiratory distress and admitted to ICU for possible PNA.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt with underlying COPD and likely some degree
   of chronic retention with bicarb of 43 and prior ABGs showing CO2 in
   60s.  Bilateral pleural effusions appear chronic with acute worsening
   on right most likely due to CHF given diminished BS. Developed apnea
   yesterday, perhaps in setting of rapidly rising CO2, also with lots of
   secretions c gram stain showing 4+GNRs. Most likely this is aspiration
   pna plus underlying CHF c chronic effusions.  Currently intubated.
   apneic on rsbi this am.
   - trend ABGs
   - wean vent prn. likely pt lives c pCO2 in mid 60s.
   - continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for now given possibility of Asp PNA
   narrow as able given culture results.
   - f/u am CXR
   - continue Alb/Atrovent nebs & fluticasone
   - f/u blood Cx, sputum culture
   -neuro following.
   -tolerating PSV yesterday, now with reduced sedation.
   -apnea yesterday could also have been due to alkalemia.
   -consider trazadone as possible cause for somnolence, respiratory
   depression.
   -send LFT
s ammonia, possible drug toxicity.
   -consider extubation later today if tolerated.
   .
   # CAD: Pt reports h/o prior MI followed by cardiology, echo with focal
   WMA, valve disease, LVEF 40% who is currently denying chest pain though
   reports progressive SOB over last 3 days. First set of CE negative and
   EKGs at baseline.  Suspect acute on chronic pleural effusions [**1-5**] heart
   failure.
   - cardiac enzymes reassuring
 negative.
   - continue Simvastatin, holding lisinopril in setting of very labile
   BP.
   - Aspirin 325mg x 1 (unclear why not on ASA at baseline).  Continue ASA
   81, talk to family about why not on aspirin regularly
 h/o GIB?
   - attempted gentle diuresis yesterday
 will likely keep mostly even
   today.
   .
   # Hypotension: ? sepsis versus effect of sedation, less likely
   cardiogenic shock as no clear precipitant and less likely volume down
   as looks somewhat fluid overloaded.
   -hold home bp meds. On Dopamine yesterday, off this morning.  Will
   attempt to keep off pressors today.
   .
   # BPH: Pt with foley in place, holding Tamsulosin for now due to
   decreased BP.
   .
   # Dementia: continue home regimen of Actonel/Ca q week
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: continue Valproic Acid 750mg qam and 1000mg qhs.
   -potentially get spot EEG today
 will discuss with neuro.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, no IVF given attempted diuresis
   -replete electrolytes
   -G-tube working now, will hold starting feeds for now, possible
   extubation later today.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying COPD and likely some degree of chronic retention with a bicarbonate level of 43. Bilateral pleural effusions appear chronic with acute worsening on the right, likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient developed apnea yesterday, possibly in the setting of rapidly rising carbon dioxide levels, along with lots of secretions showing gram-negative rods (GNRs). Most likely this is aspiration pneumonia plus underlying CHF with chronic effusions. The patient is currently intubated and apneic on respiratory support.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and new onset seizure disorder. The patient was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia and respiratory failure.

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- Discontinued trazodone due to concern of medication changes.
- Baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and ammonia levels were within normal range.
- Contacted Dr. [**Last Name (Title)**] who confirmed full code status, reported no pulmonary function tests (PFTs) on record, and did not know any reason the patient should not be on aspirin. The patient was started on baby aspirin.
- Pressors were discontinued at 11 am, and the patient was extubated at 3 pm.
- Consulted neurologist recommended bypassing EEG, reporting a past cerebrovascular accident (CVA) may be the etiology of swallowing difficulty.
- Continued episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) responsive to lopressor 5 mg with intermittent return to sinus rhythm.
- Gastrostomy (G) tube was clogged this morning.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying COPD and likely some degree of chronic retention with bicarbonate of 43 and prior AB"

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Assessment and Plan:
   80 y/o M with PMHx of CAD, COPD, dysphagia and new onset seizure d/o
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 25**] for clogged G-tube now found to be in
   respiratory distress and admitted to ICU for possible PNA.
   # Respiratory Failure: Pt with underlying COPD and likely some degree
   of chronic retention with bicarb of 43 and prior ABGs showing CO2 in
   60s.  Bilateral pleural effusions appear chronic with acute worsening
   on right most likely due to CHF given diminished BS with sputum gram
   stain showing 4 + GNRs.  This most likely represents PNA with
   underlying CHF effusion.  Patient is now extubated and breathing well.
   - continue Vanco/Cefepime/Cipro for now given possibility of Pneumonia
 consider pulling off antibiotics as culture results become available
   - f/u am CXR
   - continue Alb/Atrovent nebs & fluticasone
   - f/u blood Cx, sputum culture
   # Atrial Fibrillation: patient  with intermittent afib with RVR
   responsive to Lopressor, currently in NSR.  Patient reports hx of prior
   MI followed by cardiology and has past echo with focal WMA, valve
   disease and LVEF of 40%.  Cardiac enzymes negative and ECG showing no
   ST changes and isolated TWI in lead III c/w prior ECG.
   - stable ECG and asymptomatic.
   - consider sending CE if persists in setting of prior MI
   - continue Simvastatin, holding lisinopril in setting of very labile
   BP.
   - continue ASA 81 mg PO daily
   - follow and replete electrolytes PRN
   # Hypotension: unclear etiology as sepsis with underlying pneumonia vs.
   prior effect of sedation
   - pressors discontinued yesterday, will continue to monitor
   .
   # BPH: Pt with foley in place, holding Tamsulosin for now due to
   decreased BP.
   .
   # Dementia: continue home regimen of Actonel/Ca q week
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: continue Valproic Acid 750mg qam and 1000mg qhs.
   -will defer EEG per Neuro as they feel change in mental status was not
   subclinical status.  Patient is much more alert and active now
   post-extubation.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, no IVF given attempted diuresis
   -replete electrolytes
   -G-tube now clogged again, will attempt to unclog this AM with
   cranberry juice, coke vs. TPA
   .
   # Prophylaxis: heparin sc tid, bowel regimen, change PPI to H2 blocker
   .
   # Access: PIV and Left sided Midline
   .
   # Code: FULL
   .
   # Communication: Patient and son [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8856**]
   .
   # Disposition: ICU for now, may be suitable to be called out to floor
   later today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dysphagia, and new onset seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU for possible pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and is breathing well. He has chronic bilateral pleural effusions with acute worsening on the right, likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF). The sputum gram stain shows 4+ Gram-negative rods, indicating a possible pneumonia with underlying CHF effusion. The patient is currently on antibiotics, and cultures are pending.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AF) with intermittent rapid ventricular response (RVR), which is responsive to Lopressor. His cardiac enzymes are negative, and he has a history of prior myocardial infarction (MI) with focal wall motion abnormality (WMA) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40%. The ECG shows no ST changes and isolated T-wave inversion (TWI) in lead III. The patient's blood pressure is labile, and lisinopril is being held. He is also taking aspirin (ASA) daily.

The patient's hypotension is unclear, and it may be due to sepsis with underlying pneumonia or prior sedation. Pressors were discontinued yesterday, and his condition will continue to be monitored"
