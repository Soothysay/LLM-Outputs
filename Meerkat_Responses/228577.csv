   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old man with history of EtOH cirrhosis, diagnosed [**9-/2147**], c/b
   encephalopathy, ascites and hepatic hydronephrosis, s/p TIPS [**1-/2148**], no
   known varices, hepatoma on recent MRI, who was admitted from clinic
   with confusion/word finding difficulties, recent productive cough.
   # Respiratory: Extubated this AM, doing well.

   #Hemetemesis: Patient's source of bleeding is unclear, though he
   appears to have a possible oral source but amount of blood and clots is
   concerning for variceal bleed.  EGD unrevealing, ENT laryngoscope
   unrevealing, no blood coming out ETT so not consistent with tracheal
   source howver, patient continues to have bright red blood in his mouth.
   -2 units PRBCs

   -Tagged RBC scan, if no sign of bleeding could consider extubating.
   -Protonix gtt for now
   -CTX to cover for ?variceal bleed (and to cover PNA with Azithro and to
   cover possible SBP)
   -keep patient intubated to protect airway until bleeding source found
   -bronch to ensure bleeding not coming from lung
   .
   # AMS: Most likely hepatic encephalopathy, as this is consistent with
   his prior presentations of encephalopathy. Possible due to GI bleeding,
   also possibly infectious etiology - pt with recent productive cough and
   CXR showed possible retrocardiac opacity. SBP unlikely as no ascites
   and no abdominal pain, but it is possible. Pt has also been managing
   his own medications recently which may not be working with his mental
   status.  No recent head trauma or fall and neuro exam intact.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, diagnosed on [**9-/2147**], complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and hepatic hydronephrosis, who underwent a TIPS procedure on [**1-/2148**]. The patient is also on the transplant list. The patient was admitted from the clinic with confusion/word finding difficulties and recent productive cough.

The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and is currently extubated and doing well. However, the patient continues to have bright red blood in his mouth, indicating ongoing bleeding. The source of bleeding is unclear, but it is suspected to be variceal bleed due to his history of cirrhosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/47 mmHg to 135/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation in PSV/SBT mode with a set tidal volume of 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, diagnosed in 9/2147, who presented with confusion, word-finding difficulties, and recent productive cough. He underwent bronchoscopy, nuclear medicine scan, ultrasound, and endoscopy. The patient was extubated in the morning and is doing well. He has a possible oral source of bleeding but also has signs consistent with a variceal bleed. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells and is being monitored closely. Repeat HCT will be done, and a tagged RBC scan has been ordered. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and he has mild wheezing on exam. He is currently on IV pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications. He has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, CAP, AMS, EtOH cirrhosis, COPD, DM2, hypothyroidism, GERD, depression, replete lytes prn/regular diet, PPX, and access. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU, with consideration for a call to the hepatorenal service if his mental status improves.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in hemodynamic parameters and laboratory values. He has received multiple blood transfusions and various medications for his symptoms. The patient's sodium level is elevated, indicating hypernatremia, and he is being treated with D5W to address the free water deficit. The patient's respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula to deliver oxygen, with a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normal vital signs, and no significant abnormalities in the cardiovascular, respiratory, or abdominal systems. However, there is evidence of right and left lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleeding suggests a potential complication of ongoing or recurrent bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and anemia.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia indicates a respiratory infection that may worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of further complications, such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
3. Hypernatremia: The elevated sodium level (152 mEq/L) indicates hypernatremia, which can result in dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and neurological complications if not corrected promptly.

","The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, diagnosed in 9/2147, who has been experiencing confusion and word-finding difficulties recently. He was admitted from the clinic with these symptoms, as well as a recent productive cough. The patient underwent endoscopy, bronchoscopy, and RUQ ultrasound, which did not reveal any active bleeding. A tagged RBC scan also showed no active bleeding. The patient's Hct levels have been gradually decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss.

The patient was extubated yesterday and is doing well. However, he continues to have intermittent bloody secretions from his mouth, and an open sore was noted on his tongue. He has been given Afrin for three days and a CT scan of the neck is planned to evaluate for a tumor, mass, or arteriovenous malformation.

The patient's sodium levels are hypernatremic at 152, and he has been started on D5W at 200 cc/hr to address a free water deficit of 5.7 liters.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/60 to 148/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, who was admitted for confusion and recent productive cough. He underwent an endoscopy which revealed a hard palate ulcer and localized erosions at the gastroesophageal junction, consistent with mild esophagitis. There was no active bleeding observed during the endoscopy. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been decreasing, indicating ongoing bleeding. He has received blood transfusions to maintain his hemoglobin levels within an acceptable range.

The patient's sodium level was found to be hypernatremic at 152, and he is being treated with D5W to correct the free water deficit. He has been experiencing intermittent bloody secretions from his mouth, and an open sore was noted on his tongue. A nasogastric tube has been placed for medication administration only.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/60 to 148/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures were positive for Staphy"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, diagnosed in 9/2147, who has been experiencing encephalopathy, ascites, and hepatic hydronephrosis. The patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure in 1/2148. He also has a known hepatoma on recent MRI. The patient was admitted to the ICU with confusion, word-finding difficulties, and a recent productive cough. He was extubated yesterday and is doing well.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Hematemesis: The patient has been experiencing intermittent bright red blood in his mouth, which is concerning for a variceal bleed. However, the source of bleeding is unclear, and there appears to be a possible oral source as well. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was unrevealing, and an ENT laryngoscope was also unrevealing. The patient is on IV PPI and will likely transition to PO today. An active type and screen have been ordered.

2. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The patient has a new right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, consistent with CAP. He has been treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

3. Acute mental status change (AMS): The patient's altered mental status is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, diagnosed in 2147, complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and hepatic hydronephrosis, who underwent TIPS in 2148. He has no known varices and has a hepatoma on recent MRI. The patient was admitted from the clinic with confusion and word-finding difficulties, as well as a recent productive cough. He was extubated yesterday and is doing well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematemesis: The patient's source of bleeding is unclear, but he appears to have a possible oral source, which may be due to variceal bleeding or an ulcer on his tongue. An EGD was unrevealing, and ENT laryngoscope was also unrevealing, suggesting that the bleeding is not from a tracheal source. However, the patient continues to have bright red blood in his mouth intermittently.
2. CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia): The patient has a new right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray and is being treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP.
3. AMS (Acute Mental Status) Changes: The patient is likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which is consistent with his prior presentations of altered mental status. This could be due to GI bleeding or an infectious etiology, considering his recent productive cough and"

 CIRRHOSIS OF LIVER, ALCOHOLIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 .H/O GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   58 year old man with history of EtOH cirrhosis, diagnosed [**9-/2147**], c/b
   encephalopathy, ascites and hepatic hydronephrosis, s/p TIPS [**1-/2148**], no
   known varices, hepatoma on recent MRI, who was admitted from clinic
   with confusion/word finding difficulties, recent productive cough.
   Extubated yesterday, doing well.
   #Hemetemesis: Patient's source of bleeding is unclear, though he
   appears to have a possible oral source but amount of blood and clots
   concerning for variceal bleed; does have ulcer on tongue.  EGD
   unrevealing, ENT laryngoscope unrevealing, no blood coming out ETT so
   not consistent with tracheal source howver, patient continues to have
   bright red blood in his mouth intermittently.
   - HCT daily
   - Active type and screen
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
 can likely transition to PO today
   # CAP: New RLL opacity on CXR
   - C/w ceftriaxone x7 days, azithromycin x5 days
   # AMS: Likely hepatic encephalopathy, c/w prior presentations of
   altered MS. Possibly due to GI bleeding vs infectious etiology - pt
   with recent productive cough and CXR showed possible retrocardiac
   opacity. SBP unlikely as no ascites and no abdominal pain, but it is
   possible.
   - Ceftriaxone/Azithro for CAP (day [**2149-3-3**])
   - f/u UA, UCx, BCx
   - CTX as above to cover SBP
   - Lactulose, Rifaximin with titration to 4 bowel movements daily
   # Hypernatremia: Responding appropriately to free water infusions, tube
   feed flushes etc
   - PM serum sodium
   - Encourage/liberalize PO free water consumption
   - Include free water flushes from tube feeds in free H20 infusion but
   will pull NGT this morning
   # EtOH Cirrhosis: Diagnosed [**9-/2147**], c/b encephalopathy, ascites, and
   hepatic hydronephrosis, s/p TIPS [**1-/2148**], no known varices, hepatoma on
   recent MRI. On the transplant list.
   - Lactulose, Rifaximin
   - Consider restarting Spironolactone/Lasix now that BP are stable and
   no active bleeding
   - Monitor abdominal exam for need of paracentesis of ascites

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who presented with confusion, word-finding difficulties, and a recent productive cough. He was admitted from the clinic and extubated yesterday. The patient has been experiencing hematemesis, with an unclear source of bleeding. There is a possibility of an oral source or variceal bleed, as he has an ulcer on his tongue. Endoscopy and laryngoscopy have been unrevealing, but the patient continues to have intermittent bright red blood in his mouth.

The patient has several medical conditions, including cirrhosis of the liver, pneumonia, altered mental status (not delirium), and gastrointestinal bleeding. He also has hypernatremia (high sodium levels), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), depression, and renal failure (replete electrolytes).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 91/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 96%. His weight is currently 110.5 kg, and his height is 71 inches.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.9 K/uL,"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old man with history of EtOH cirrhosis, diagnosed [**9-/2147**], c/b
   encephalopathy, ascites and hepatic hydronephrosis, s/p TIPS [**1-/2148**], no
   known varices, hepatoma on recent MRI, who was admitted from clinic
   with confusion/word finding difficulties, recent productive cough.
   Extubated yesterday, doing well.
   #Hemetemesis: Patient's source of bleeding is unclear, though he
   appears to have a possible oral source but amount of blood and clots
   concerning for variceal bleed; does have ulcer on tongue.  EGD
   unrevealing, ENT laryngoscope unrevealing, no blood coming out ETT so
   not consistent with tracheal source howver, patient continues to have
   bright red blood in his mouth intermittently.
   - HCT daily
   - Active type and screen
   - continue PO PPI
   # CAP: New RLL opacity on CXR
   - C/w ceftriaxone x7 days, azithromycin x5 days (last dose azithro
   today)
   # AMS: Likely hepatic encephalopathy, c/w prior presentations of
   altered MS. Possibly due to GI bleeding vs infectious etiology - pt
   with recent productive cough and CXR showed possible retrocardiac
   opacity. SBP unlikely as no ascites and no abdominal pain, but it is
   possible.
   - Ceftriaxone/Azithro for CAP (day [**2149-3-3**])
   - f/u UA, UCx, BCx
   - CTX as above to cover SBP
   - Lactulose, Rifaximin with titration to 4 bowel movements daily
   # Hypernatremia: Responding appropriately to free water infusions, tube
   feed flushes etc
   - Encourage/liberalize PO free water consumption
   # EtOH Cirrhosis: Diagnosed [**9-/2147**], c/b encephalopathy, ascites, and
   hepatic hydronephrosis, s/p TIPS [**1-/2148**], no known varices, hepatoma on
   recent MRI. On the transplant list.
   - Lactulose, Rifaximin
   - Restart  Spironolactone/Lasix now that BP is stable and no active
   bleeding
   - Monitor abdominal exam for need of paracentesis of ascites
   # COPD: Mild wheezing on exam
   - Alb/Atrovent nebs prn
   - Fluticasone-Salmeterol inh [**Hospital1 **]
   # DM2: Diet controlled
   - ISS while hospitalized
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue Levothyroxine when taking PO
   # GERD:  now on PO PPI
   # Depression: Continue Wellbutrin, Venlafaxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, diagnosed in [**9-/2147**], presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, and hepatic hydronephrosis. He underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure on [**1-/2148**]. The patient has no known varices and was diagnosed with a hepatoma on recent MRI. He was admitted from the clinic with confusion and word-finding difficulties, along with a recent productive cough. The patient was extubated yesterday and is doing well.

The patient is currently experiencing hematemesis, with an unclear source of bleeding. There appears to be a possible oral source, but there is also concern for a variceal bleed due to the presence of an ulcer on the tongue. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, but it did not reveal any significant findings. The patient continues to have intermittent bleeding in his mouth.

Additionally, the patient has a new right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, which may indicate a possible pneumonia. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) for this condition. 

The patient is also likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which is associated with his history of cirrhosis. This condition may be exacerbated by gastrointestinal bleeding or an infectious etiology"
