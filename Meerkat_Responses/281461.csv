   Assessment and Plan
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis.  No
   e/o malignancy at this point.  Patient started on heparin gtt.  Also
   with diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion.
   No e/o localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though
   s/p paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC).  Given compromised bowel
   wall, at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Vanc / Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Transition to Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Resend C.diff if new leukocytosis, febrile
    - GI recommendations
   - Started on Tube feeds overnight
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - VAP (Cefepime / Vanc) x 14 days total
     - Check NIF in AM (to assess for nueromuscular component)
     - Trial pressure support
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP/VAP (14 days total)
    - Stop Tobramycin
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance
    - Goal SBP 80
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR
   [**1-16**].  Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff negative) thought
   to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - Per discussion with Vascular, no reason to not use Lovenox
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation.  NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**].  Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss
    - T&C x 2U PRBC
    - Monitor q8H Hct until stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Renal insufficiency: Increased Cr to 0.7 from 0.4-0.5.  Could be [**1-15**]
   hypovolemia, infection (with Foley) vs medication reaction with AIN.
    - UA, Ulytes, UEos
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis.  Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Abdominal pain: The patient has a superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombus with collaterals indicative of a chronic process. There is concern for low flow state in the setting of chronic pancreatitis. The patient is at high risk for bowel ischemia/congestion due to compromised bowel wall.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin). There is a persistent LLL infiltrate on CXR, but no appreciable changes in ventilator settings. Heavy secretions are present.

3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure is high 70s-low 80s. The patient experienced hypotension overnight on 02/19/2115. Possible causes include septic shock or low flow state.

4. SMV occlusion: The patient has an SMV occlusion, for which anticoagulation therapy has been initiated. There is a concern for bowel edema causing malabsorption and subsequent anemia.

5. Anemia: The patient has acute on chronic anemia, possibly due to anticoagulation, bowel wall edema, or dilutional component.

    Assessment and Plan
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis.  No
   e/o malignancy at this point.  Patient started on heparin gtt.  Also
   with diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion.
   No e/o localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though
   s/p paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC).  Given compromised bowel
   wall, at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Vanc / Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Transition to Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Resend C.diff if new leukocytosis, febrile
    - GI recommendations
   - Started on Tube feeds overnight
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - VAP (Cefepime / Vanc) x 14 days total
     - Check NIF in AM (to assess for nueromuscular component)
     - Trial pressure support
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP/VAP (14 days total)
    - Stop Tobramycin
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance
    - Goal SBP 80
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR
   [**1-16**].  Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff negative) thought
   to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - Per discussion with Vascular, no reason to not use Lovenox
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation.  NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**].  Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss
    - T&C x 2U PRBC
    - Monitor q8H Hct until stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Renal insufficiency: Increased Cr to 0.7 from 0.4-0.5.  Could be [**1-15**]
   hypovolemia, infection (with Foley) vs medication reaction with AIN.
    - UA, Ulytes, UEos
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis.  Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps.  On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient.

    Assessment and Plan
   34M cerebral palsy initially p/w concern for abdominal infection now
   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.0 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission, likely
   poor PO intake.
   - UA, Ulytes, UEos
   - holding vanc and tobra
   - consider renal consult
   - give another 500cc NS
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - D/C vanc given high levels
    - Continue Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Send repeat C.diff given fevers
   - GI recommendations
   - Hold tube feeds (started overnight) for extubation
   - Cont TPN across the day, order for tomorrow but hope to wean if can
   - Start pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10339**] re: potential syndrome
   - check celiac disease labs
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline. NIF today showing
   significant component of NM contribution.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - d/c vanc and tobra
     - continue Cefepime x 14 days total
     - Trial pressure support today and ? extubation
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Antibiotics as above (cont Zosyn, stopping Vanc and Tobra)
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance; goal even
    - Goal SBP 80, MAP ~60s
    - if bolus use 250-500cc
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR [**1-16**],
   now holding coumadin. Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff
   negative) thought to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - continue low dose Lovenox (discussed with vascular) at 30 qd
    - check Factor Xa level after 3^rd dose
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
    - trend PLT (increased today, but some concern for HIT)
    - send HIT antibody
    - if tolerates tube feeds may restart Coumadin in next few days
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation. NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**]. Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss. No blood yet given.
    - T&C x 2U PRBC; transfuse to 21 unless e/o ischemia/bleeding
    - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct now that stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
    - check HIT antibodies as above
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] as above
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis. Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome. Phenobarb level within therapeutic range on admission.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
    - check free dilantin level and free phenobarb levels
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps. On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient. Patient
   transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.
    - Discuss restarting Dilantin / Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])
    - switch to phosphenitoin
   # FEN  Euvolemic to hypovolemic / replete PRN / continue TPN for now /
   start tube feeds later today

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of cerebral palsy, abdominal infection, renal insufficiency, SMV thrombus, and chronic pancreatitis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing intermittent fevers since admission and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with a combination of antibiotics. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. His blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals clear lung sounds but with evidence of tacchypnea. The patient's abdomen is soft and nontender without guarding or rebound. There are no signs of extremity edema or jugular venous distention. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, indicating renal insufficiency. White blood cell count is within normal range. Liver function tests are also abnormal with elevated levels of AST and ALT. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits. Blood cultures have shown no growth. 

The patient's medical plan includes holding vancomycin and tobramycin, continuing piperacillin/tazobactam, and initiating low-molecular-weight heparin due to the SMV occlusion. The family has been educated about the potential syndrome and celiac disease labs have been ordered. 

The patient's nursing care plan involves monitoring fluid balance, providing goal-directed therapy, and maintaining strict blood glucose control. Prophylactic measures such as stress"

   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Antibiotics as above (cont Zosyn, stopping Vanc and Tobra)
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance; goal even
    - Goal SBP 80, MAP ~60s
    - if bolus use 250-500cc
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR [**1-16**],
   now holding coumadin. Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff
   negative) thought to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - continue low dose Lovenox (discussed with vascular) at 30 qd
    - check Factor Xa level after 3^rd dose
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
    - trend PLT (increased today, but some concern for HIT)
    - send HIT antibody
    - if tolerates tube feeds may restart Coumadin in next few days
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation. NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**]. Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss. No blood yet given.
    - T&C x 2U PRBC; transfuse to 21 unless e/o ischemia/bleeding
    - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct now that stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
    - check HIT antibodies as above
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] as above
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis. Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome. Phenobarb level within therapeutic range on admission.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
    - check free dilantin level and free phenobarb levels
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps. On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient. Patient
   transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.
    - Discuss restarting Dilantin / Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])
    - switch to phosphenitoin
   # FEN  Euvolemic to hypovolemic / replete PRN / continue TPN for now /
   start tube feeds later today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male with cerebral palsy who was initially admitted due to concerns of an abdominal infection and later reintubated for respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications including renal insufficiency, abdominal pain with a suspected superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, respiratory failure, fever, hypotension, chronic pancreatitis, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, and a seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels have risen to 1.2 from a baseline of 0.3-0.4. This could be due to a series of renal insults such as hypovolemia, infection, and medications. The patient may require a renal consult and should be given another 500cc NS bolus. Urine electrolytes are consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

2. Abdominal Pain: The patient has a finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals indicating a chronic process. Surgery and Vascular are involved, suspecting low flow state in the setting of chronic pancreatitis. The patient is at high risk for bowel ischemia/congestion and translocation of bacteria.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) with Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin. ID"

   Assessment and Plan
   34M cerebral palsy initially p/w concern for abdominal infection now
   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.2 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible ATN/AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission,
   likely poor PO intake.
   -Urine lytes consistent w/ ATN
   - holding vanc and tobra
   - consider renal consult
   - give another 500cc NS
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - D/C vanc given high levels
    - Continue Lovenox (30 mg QD per Pharmacy)
   -  Start on Coumadin 5mg PO tonight
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Send repeat C.diff given fevers
   - GI recommendations
   - Hold tube feeds (started overnight) for extubation
   - Cont TPN and tube feeds
 start weaning TPN once INR starts to
   elevate (would indicate gut absorption)
   - Continue pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10339**] re: potential syndrome
   - F/U celiac disease labs
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline. NIF today showing
   significant component of NM contribution.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - d/c vanc and tobra
     - continue Cefepime x 14 days total
    - consider starting chest PT
   # Hypernatremia:  Sodium is 149.  Approximately 1.3L free water
   defecit.
   -          increase free water flushes today by giving 200 q6h via NG
   -          check PM lytes
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Antibiotics as above (cont Zosyn, stopping Vanc and Tobra)
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance; goal even
    - Goal SBP 80, MAP ~60s
    - if bolus use 250-500cc
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR [**1-16**],
   now holding coumadin. Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff
   negative) thought to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - continue low dose Lovenox (discussed with vascular) at 30 qd
    - check Factor Xa level after 3^rd dose
    - Start Coumadin
    - trend PLT (increased today, but some concern for HIT)
    - send HIT antibody
    - if tolerates tube feeds may restart Coumadin in next few days
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation. NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**]. Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss. No blood yet given.
    - T&C x 2U PRBC; transfuse to 21 unless e/o ischemia/bleeding
    - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct now that stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
    - check HIT antibodies as above
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] as above
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis. Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome. Phenobarb level within therapeutic range on admission.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
    - check free dilantin level and free phenobarb levels
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps. On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient. Keppra
   DC
d.  Started on fosphenytoin and phenobarb and levels are currently
   reasonable.
    - Continue  Fosphenytoin / Phenobarbital
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])
   # FEN  Euvolemic to hypovolemic / replete PRN / continue TPN for now /
   start tube feeds later today
   # PPX:
   - PPI
   - Chlorehexadine gluconate
   - Pneumoboots
   - Systemically anticoagulated
   # ACCESS: L-Subclavian CL ([**2115-2-13**]); R PIV

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 34-year-old male with cerebral palsy, was admitted with concerns of abdominal infection and later reintubated for respiratory failure.
- The patient has been diagnosed with renal insufficiency, likely due to a series of renal insults including hypovolemia, infection (with Foley), and medications.
- The patient also has an abdominal pain related to a Superior Mesenteric Vein (SMV) thrombus, which has been treated with heparin.
- The patient is being treated for Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP)/Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) with Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Tobramycin.
- The patient has hypernatremia, fever, hypotension, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, and cerebral palsy.
- The patient is currently on anticoagulation therapy with heparin and Coumadin, but Coumadin has been temporarily held due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and concern for possible Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT).
- The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may be related to dilutional effects of fluid administration, but further investigation is needed.
- The patient's coagulopathy and hypoalbuminemia are also being addressed"
