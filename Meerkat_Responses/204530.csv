 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM). Initially due to hypercarbia,

   negative staph bacteremia. This most recent episode likely due to
   hypoxia and mild hypercarbia.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]) The patient was slightly
   dyspneic at baseline on presentation. The daughter reported that the
   patient was wearing continuous O2 at home with good oxygen sats. The
   CXR was consistent with fluid overload. The patient was diuresed with
   lasix. The diureses greatly improved the patient's symptoms. She was
   sating in the low 90's on room air. She was placed on BiPAP at night
   (on the patient's home settings) and nasal canula during the day. She
   was then transferred to the floor, where the patient had an inpatient
   overnight sleep study on CPAP that did not go well, as above.
   -- cont BiPAP
   -- arrange for floor BiPAP.
   # Diastolic Heart Failure. The patient presented with fluid overload,
   which likely contributed to her dyspnea. The CXR was consistent with
   fluid overload. The patient had an elevated BNP as well. The patient
   was diuresed with lasix and her home dose of lopressor was started
   (although the patient was not taking this medication). The lopressor
   was later stopped due to patient and family refusal.

   Disposition:Transfer to floor
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including MDS, Crohn's disease, CAD with NSTEMI, CKD, breast cancer, and worsening respiratory status of unclear etiology. The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various reasons.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a line infection (central or arterial) with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia. This is likely due to her indwelling port.
2. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient has experienced episodes of altered mental status, likely due to hypoxia and mild hypercarbia.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has had dyspnea and required BiPAP for nighttime use. She also required continuous oxygen therapy.
4. Hyperkalemia (high potassium, hyperpotassemia): The patient has had intermittent episodes of high potassium levels, which responded to diuresis and kayexelate.
5. Crohn's disease (regional enteritis): The patient's Crohn's disease has been managed with medication and a steroid taper.
6. Diastolic heart failure: The patient presented with fluid overload, consistent with diastolic heart failure.
7. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's creatinine levels have been near baseline.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including MDS, Crohn's disease, CAD with NSTEMI, CKD, and breast cancer. The patient presented with worsening respiratory status of unclear etiology and was transferred from the floor for hypoxia and altered mental status in the setting of failed CPAP titration and family attempt to replace mask.

The assessment and plan include:
1. Altered mental status: The patient initially had hypercarbia, which resolved. Infection also contributed to the altered mental status with coagulase-negative staph bacteremia. The most recent episode is likely due to hypoxia and mild hypercarbia. The plan is to reassess ABG this morning, consider head imaging if there is no improvement with BiPAP, and give zidus prior to BiPAP to ease anxiety about the mask.
2. Line infection (central or arterial): The patient has coagulase-negative staph bacteremia, likely from the PORT. Vanc level is 27.4, and the plan is to treat through due to poor vascular access. Monitoring for fever, follow-up blood culture, and a 14-day Vanc IV course starting on [**2194-9-5**] (d2/14) will be implemented.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient was slightly dyspneic at baseline on presentation. She"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including MDS, Crohn's disease, CAD with a history of NSTEMI, CKD, breast cancer, and worsening respiratory status. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and altered mental status, which initially resolved but returned. She has a history of failed CPAP titration and a family attempt to replace the mask. The patient is currently on BiPAP and O2 delivery via nasal cannula. Her vital signs are stable, but she has mild hypoxia. She has a central line infection, respiratory failure, diastolic heart failure, hyperkalemia, Crohn's disease, CKD, anemia, CAD, a DVT, chronic bilateral LE edema, GERD, and a fungal groin rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status and history of failed CPAP titration indicate potential respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABG analysis is essential to assess the severity and manage the condition appropriately.

2. Line infection (central or arterial): The presence of a central line and coagulase-negative staph bacteremia suggests a potential line infection. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, and close observation of the line site are necessary. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics should be initiated based on blood culture results.

3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's fluid overload,"

   # Diastolic Heart Failure. The patient presented with fluid overload,
   which likely contributed to her dyspnea. The CXR was consistent with
   fluid overload. The patient had an elevated BNP as well. The patient
   was diuresed with lasix and her home dose of lopressor was started
   (although the patient was not taking this medication). The lopressor
   was later stopped due to patient and family refusal.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including MDS, Crohn's disease with multiple GI bleeds, CAD s/p NSTEMI, CKD, and breast cancer. She was admitted to the ICU due to worsening respiratory status over the past several months, hypoxia, and altered mental status in the setting of failed CPAP titration and family attempt to replace the mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of worsening respiratory status and was placed on BiPAP due to acute respiratory failure. She requires continued monitoring and treatment for respiratory support.
2. Line Infection: The patient has a central line infection with coagulase-negative staph bacteremia. Treatment with vancomycin is planned, and the line should be removed if possible.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient presented with fluid overload, which likely contributed to her dyspnea. Diuresis with lasix improved her symptoms. Close monitoring and management of fluid balance are necessary.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has intermittent high potassium levels, which need to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate medications like kayexelate.
5. Crohn's Disease: The patient's Crohn's disease is being managed with mesalamin and steroid taper. She also had episodes of diarrhea, which resolved spontaneously.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's baseline creatinine level is near normal, but"
