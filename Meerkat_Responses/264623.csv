","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of mental retardation and multiple visits to the ICU. She presented with a large pericardial effusion that was drained, and a mediastinal mass that was biopsied revealing nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory failure improved with draining of pleural effusions, recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF), Clostridium difficile infection (C.diff), chronic ileus requiring total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and received gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and dexamethasone (GVD) chemotherapy on 08/15/2144. 

On 08/23/2144, the patient was found on the floor with a heart rate in the 150s and blood pressures initially in the 80s/40s. A 500cc bolus was given, and she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) where intravenous diltiazem was attempted, but it had no effect on heart rate and only dropped blood pressure. The patient has no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was not mentioned. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for tachycardia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 160 beats per minute (bpm) in supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT), blood pressure of 107/56, and heart rhythm of SVT. The patient received total intravenous fluids (IVF) and blood products, but there were no outputs recorded. Respiratory support was provided, but the arterial blood gas (ABG) results were not mentioned. 

The physical examination findings were not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, tone, and other systems. 

The assessment and plan include restarting intravenous amiodarone for rapid AF, which spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The patient has a history of Hodgkin's Lymphoma and is scheduled for the second round of chemotherapy tomorrow. She also has C.diff and will continue with Flagyl until 09/05/2144. The patient is on acyclovir for suspected herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, continues to be NPO (nothing by mouth) for ileus, and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and other ICU care. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI), and she is to remain in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and recently diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma. She is currently in the ICU for recurrent hemopericardium and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has bibasilar crackles on lung examination and warm, dry 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. Her lab results show an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as abnormalities in potassium, sodium, and chloride levels. The patient has a widened cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray and evidence of tamponade physiology on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's TTE shows tamponade physiology, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke.
3. Hemopericardium: The patient has recurrent hemopericardium, which can lead to cardiac tamponade if not managed appropriately.
4. Infection: The patient has crusted perioral lesions and poor dentition, which may indicate an underlying infection. She is also receiving IV flagyl for suspected Clostridium difficile colitis.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has signs of"

   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: unclear precipitant; afebrile, appears
   euvolemic; ? [**3-14**] enlarged cardiac silouette and posisbel reaccumulation
   of pericardial effusion.  She has had difficult to control afib in the
   past on max dose esmolol and diltiazem drips and finally converted with
   amiodarone during her last ICU visit.
   - restart on amiodarone IV drip; will hold on bolus; will hold on

   Imaging: CXR-Increased cardiac size with evolution of some bilateral
   peri-hilar pulmonary infiltrates.
   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo female with h/o mental retardation and recent Dx. Lymphoma admit
   with A-fib and RVR to ICU.  She has had some concern for worsening of
   pericadial effusion in the setting of increasing cardiac size on plain
   film.  Overall tachycardia has been managed wtih Amiodarone with
   reasonable response.  She now has evolved an increased in peicardial
   size concerning for worsening effusion and now with evidence on ECHO
   and peri-hilar infiltrates of significant worsening of pericardial
   effusion with tamponade which has been confirmed by EHCO this am.
   1)Pericardial Effusion-
   -Cardiology consult for movement to drainage of effusion
   emergently
this is given tamponde physiology and suggestion of perhaps
   compromise of LVEDP contributing to pulmonary edema.  More clearly
   there is a suggestion of RV compromise on ECHO and urgent drainage
   needed.
   -Coags-nl
   -Cardiology to be consulted for drainage.
   -IVF bolus as needed
   2)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Continue with Amiodarone as maintenance of sinus rhythm is essential
   if possible.
   2.5)Respiratory Distress-
   [**Month (only) 60**] be a component of pulmonary edema in the setting of pericardial
   tamponade.
   3)C.Diff-

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and recent diagnosis of lymphoma. She was admitted with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing an increase in cardiac silhouette size over the past 24 hours, which raises concern for worsening pericardial effusion. There has also been a decrease in hematocrit (HCT) level, indicating potential blood loss or anemia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), a heart rate of 84 beats per minute (bpm) within normal range, blood pressure ranging from 115/56 mmHg to 152/137 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the respiratory system, suggesting possible pulmonary edema. There are no murmurs appreciated in the cardiovascular system. The extremities show mild edema (1+). The neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 5.4 K/uL. The platelet count is within normal range at 173 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, and liver function"
