","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma (MM), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and depression. He was admitted with hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient's current chief complaint is sepsis.
- On the 24-hour events, the patient underwent a trans thoracic echo which showed preserved ejection fraction with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
- The patient was taken off levophed from 4 pm to 10 pm and briefly placed back on due to blood pressure in the 80s.
- He received a total of 3.5 liters of intravenous fluids yesterday.
- At around 10 pm, the patient developed acute dyspnea, and physical examination findings were consistent with pulmonary edema. He was given 2 mg IV morphine, lasix 20 mg IV, and nebulization with resolution of symptoms. A chest X-ray also confirmed pulmonary edema.
- A CT torso was negative for the source of sepsis.
- Repeat SVo2 was 88%, and peak flow was 170 nebs started.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 02/15/2159 at 01:13 AM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 02/16/2159 at 06:08 AM.
- The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the below.
- Vital signs as of 02/16/2159 at 07:41 AM include a temperature of 36.8 C (98.2 F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/64 to 80/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings are also documented.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 1.8, and troponin T of 0.22. Other lab values are within normal ranges.
- Imaging findings include small bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis on the right side. There is no source of sepsis identified on CT.
- Microbiology results indicate a negative respiratory viral antigen test for influenza and other respiratory viruses.
- Assessment and plan include dyspnea, renal failure, and hypotension. The patient is suspected to have an occult infection compounded by poor oral intake and relative adrenal insufficiency in the setting of chronic steroid use.
- The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and other medications as per the treatment plan.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and depression. He was admitted with hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently being treated with aggressive intravenous fluids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and stress dose steroids. His vital signs are stable, but he experienced acute dyspnea last evening, which resolved with the administration of morphine, lasix, and nebulizers. A transthoracic echo showed preserved ejection fraction with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. CT torso did not identify a source of sepsis. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, and low potassium and magnesium levels. Imaging studies revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent compressive atelectasis. Microbiology tests are pending. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further interventions are planned based on his response to treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with hypotension, elevated white blood cell count, and possible occult infection raises concerns for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any worsening of the condition.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute dyspnea and pulmonary edema suggest the possibility of ARDS,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, deep vein thrombosis, and currently admitted for septic shock. The patient's condition has improved since admission, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient has developed acute pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. These findings suggest possible cardiac or respiratory issues. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is essential.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels. This could be due to sepsis-induced acute kidney injury or underlying chronic kidney disease. Frequent monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, including fluid balance and medication adjustments, are necessary.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis and is receiving systemic anticoagulation therapy. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters, such as international normalized ratio (INR), is important to prevent bleeding complications while maintaining adequate anticoagulation.

4. Infection: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's condition may still be complicated by ongoing or recurrent infections. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and imaging studies will help identify any new or worsening infections.

5. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient's hypotension and presence of a systolic murmur raise concerns about cardiac dysfunction. Continuous"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma and deep vein thrombosis, admitted to the ICU in septic shock. The patient's condition has improved, but he still experiences dyspnea and hypotension. He has been weaned off pressors and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has renal failure, which has resolved, and pleural effusions. He is now stable but remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's acute pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions indicate a risk for respiratory complications. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory status is necessary.

2. Renal Failure: Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved, his history of multiple myeloma and the presence of huge renal cysts on CT scan may increase the risk of renal dysfunction. Frequent assessment of renal function through laboratory tests is recommended.

3. Infection: The patient is still on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating an ongoing concern for infection. Regular monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and other laboratory parameters will help identify any potential infectious complications.

4. Cardiac Issues: The patient's history of multiple myeloma and the presence of a systolic murmur on cardiac examination suggest a potential cardiac involvement. Close monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm, blood pressure, and cardiac enzymes is necessary to detect any cardiac-related complications.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and currently admitted to the ICU in shock. The patient is experiencing dyspnea (shortness of breath), renal failure, and hypotension. The medical team suspects septic shock but cannot localize any infection. They have initiated fluid resuscitation and are following the Rivers protocol for managing septic shock. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have also been started.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/64 mmHg to 127/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is between 64% and 88%.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and not in acute distress. There are no abnormal findings in the cardiovascular, respiratory, or abdominal areas. Neurological assessment is incomplete.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels at 1.8 mg/dL, and an elevated troponin-T level of 0.22. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are also provided.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and depression. He was admitted with hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient experienced an episode of hypoxia and dyspnea last night, which improved with the administration of morphine and Lasix. A chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and congestion, suggestive of flash pulmonary edema. Cardiac enzymes were negative. The patient also has leukocytosis and hematuria with bilateral renal cysts seen on a CT scan. The urology department recommended cytology for further evaluation. The patient's condition is likely sepsis, and he is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, stress dose steroids, and other supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of dyspnea and hypoxia, along with the findings of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on the chest X-ray, indicate flash pulmonary edema. This condition can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Sepsis: The patient presents with leukocytosis and hypotension, which are suggestive of sepsis. Prompt identification and treatment of the underlying infection are crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient initially presented with ARF, which has now resolved. It is important to monitor renal"

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, hypotension, and renal failure. The patient's condition has been unstable with episodes of acute dyspnea, ST depressions on ECG, and negative cardiac enzymes. BIPAP was placed due to improvement in dyspnea. The patient received Lasix and morphine for acute dyspnea episode. Review of systems is unchanged from admission. Vital signs are relatively stable with sinus rhythm and normal oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 10 mmHg and fluid balance with a total input of 819 mL and output of 2505 mL. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with FiO2 of 40%. ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.36. Labs show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and increased Cr levels. Troponin-T is negative. The patient has been on multiple medications including Lasix, morphine, and metoprolol. The assessment includes dyspnea, acute renal failure, and hypotension. The plan includes ICU care with nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

   84 yo M with history of MM, DVT, admitted with hypotension and ARF.

   #. Hypotension - Patient is afebrile, with a leukocytosis and no
   localizing symptoms. Hypotension was refractory to 3L of NS. Elevated
   WBC could be from dexamethasone, but there is a left shift and a mild
   bandemia. Suspicion is for occult infection compounded by poor PO
   intake and relative adrenal insufficiency in the setting of chronic
   steroid use. Other possibilties include PE, but no shortness of breath
   or tachycardia; cardiogenic shock is unlikely, as troponin elevation is
   less likely ACS and more likely the result of ARF and hypotension. As
   for source of possible sepsis, patient does not have any localizing
   symptoms. He is s/p CCY, UA is unremarkable, CXR is clear, abdominal
   exam is benign, no rashes. Given that he is relatively
   immunocompromised, it could be bacterial, atypicals or perhaps viral or
   fungal infection leading to poor PO intake and dehydration and actually
   not sepsis at this point. ?influenza, but no characteristic symptoms.

   #. Leukocytosis
 most likely related to underlying infection of
   unclear etiology, Cont. abx as above, improving. CT Torso with question
   of renal cysts b/l, urology consult to eval for possible source of
   infection
   - abx as above
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #. Elevated troponin - no EKG changes. This is likely in the setting of
   hypotension and ARF. ROMI negative

   #. Multiple Myeloma - multiple myeloma for which he takes dexamethasone
   weekly on a regular basis.  He gets most of his medications as well as
   labs done at the VA and his oncologist is at [**Hospital3 **].  He recently
   has been having problems with pain in his back and legs.

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma (MM) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted for hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's leukocytosis could be due to dexamethasone or an occult infection compounded by poor oral intake and relative adrenal insufficiency in the setting of chronic steroid use. Other possibilities include pulmonary embolism (PE), but there are no symptoms of shortness of breath or tachycardia, and cardiogenic shock is unlikely. The source of possible sepsis is unclear, as the patient does not have any localizing symptoms, and imaging studies such as chest X-ray, urinalysis, and abdominal exam are unremarkable.

The patient's hypotension was initially refractory to normal saline (NS) but improved with intravenous fluid resuscitation. His blood pressure remains stable, but he requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance of central venous pressure (CVP) at 10-12 mmHg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The patient's renal function has improved with intravenous fluids and dose adjustment of medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old man with hypotension and ARF. Plan as per resident note.
   Briefly, some degree of fluid overload but CXR does seem consistent
   with LLL consolidation vs atelectasis.
   Decompensation yesterday was reportedly in association with left side
   down, so suspect PNA is primary pathology. Continue current
   antibitiotics, on stress dose steroids which we can taper down to his
   home dose of dex. Cr approaching baseline. With history of DVT will
   check LENI's. He is already systemicaly anticoagulated.   Continue
   diuresisFurther plan as per resident note.

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on coumadin. He was admitted with hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF). He is currently on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and azithromycin. The patient has been requiring non-invasive ventilation multiple times throughout the night and into the early morning. 

His vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/64 to 155/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 819 mL and an output of 2505 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1687 mL. He is receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 1056 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 16 cmH2O.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old man with hypotension and ARF. Plan as per resident note.
   Briefly, some degree of fluid overload but CXR does seem consistent
   with LLL consoliudation vs atelectasis.
   Decompensation yesterday was reportedly in association with left side
   down, so suspect PNA is primary pathology. Continue current
   antibitiotics, on stress dose steroids which we can taper down to his
   home dose of dex. Cr approaching baseline. With history of DVT will
   check LENI's. He is already systemicaly anticoagulated. Further plan as
   per resident note.

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who was admitted with hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been started on vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring multiple episodes of non-invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/64 mmHg to 76/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 819 mL and output of 2,505 mL.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 16.0 to 21.3 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 1.3 to 1.8 mg/dL, and a troponin-T level of 0.22 ng/mL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and is being treated with antibiotics. The plan is to continue current antibiotics and taper down"

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and benign prostatic hypertrophy. He was admitted with hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to pneumonia (PNA). The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and stress-dose steroids, which are being tapered off. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 143/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on BiPAP. The patient's physical examination reveals mild distress and dyspnea but feels comfortable. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels at 1.8 mg/dL, and mildly elevated troponin T levels at 0.22 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, flash pulmonary edema, and hematuria. He also has a history of ARF, DVT, depression, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's sepsis and pneumonia pose a significant risk if not adequately treated. The flash pulmonary edema could worsen if fluid balance is not closely monitored. Additionally, the patient's renal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of multiple myeloma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and depression. He was admitted with hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient experienced an episode of respiratory distress overnight, which improved with morphine and Lasix. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and congestion, suggestive of flash pulmonary edema. The patient also likely has sepsis, indicated by leukocytosis and hypotension, although the source is unclear. Stress dose steroids are being tapered off, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued. The patient has hematuria and bilateral renal cysts, and a urine cytology has been recommended. The ARF is now resolved, and the patient's multiple myeloma is in remission. He has a history of DVT and will continue on Coumadin. The patient is also being treated for depression and benign prostatic hypertrophy. In the ICU, the patient's nutritional needs are being met, and regular insulin sliding scale is used for glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation for DVT and a stress ulcer H2 blocker. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and hypoxia, along with the chest X-ray findings, suggest flash pulmonary"
