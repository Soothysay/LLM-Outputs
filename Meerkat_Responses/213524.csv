   Assessment and Plan
   74 M with dialated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD placement admitted for
   hypovolemic hypotension.
   .
   HYPOTENSION - Multiple potential causes exist for his hypotension.  He
   was well diuresed, coming in 2 lbs over dry weight following 1.5 L
   resuscitation in the ED.  He was also discharged on increased
   beta-blockade.  The absence of p-waves on his EKG raises the
   possibility of atrial-venous asynchrony.  He has reduced cardiac output
   from cardiomyopathy.  He is on chronic steroids and could have a
   component of adrenal insufficiency.  Although he had a recent
   infection, this was treated with broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and
   he has no signs of infection.  No evidence of active ischemia or
   cardiogenic shock.  Lactate is non-specific.  PE unlikely given
   therapeutic INR, but would consider if hypotension persists.
   - hold antihypertensives, would discharge on lower BB dose.
   - no antibiotics for now
   - follow blood, urine, sputum cultures, fever curve, white count.
   - PA and lateral CXR
   - trend lactate
   - wean levophed
   - consider swan-catheter to eval volume status and cardiac function in
   AM
   .
   VENTRICULAR ARRYTHMIA: History of VT in the setting of volume
   overload.  Also, scheduled for ablation on Monday.
   - hold coumadin in preparation for ablation
   - monitor on tele
   - Will make EP aware.
   .
   CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Was likely at or below dry weight on
   admission, now up 1.5 L.  Elevated BNP, JVP, CVP.
   - will diurese gently with Lasix 60 mg daily.
   .
   COPD: Does not appear to be in acute flair
   - Advair/Spireva/Prednisone
   .
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: On last admission, Cr improved
   initially with lasix and then increased.  Now elevated well over
   baseline.  Urine shows hyaline casts.  FeUrea 35%.  All consistent with
   pre-renal.
   - Watch Cr with rehydration

   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Resolved on admission to CCU following fluid
   resuscitation with falling lactate.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and an implanted automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD). He was admitted for hypovolemic hypotension and is currently in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can be attributed to multiple factors including being well diuresed, having reduced cardiac output due to cardiomyopathy, being on chronic steroids, and potential adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is required to determine the exact cause.

2. Ventricular Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of volume overload. He is scheduled for ablation on Monday. The following actions should be taken:
   - Hold coumadin in preparation for ablation
   - Monitor on tele
   - Inform the electrophysiology (EP) team

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient likely was at or below dry weight on admission and has gained 1.5 liters since then. Elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), jugular venous pressure (JVP), and central venous pressure (CVP) indicate CHF. The following action should be taken:
   - Diurese gently with Lasix 60 mg daily

4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy who was admitted for hypovolemic hypotension. The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, ventricular arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, COPD, acute on chronic renal failure, and anion gap acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys. This can result in organ damage or failure if not promptly addressed.

2. Ventricular arrhythmia: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT), which can be life-threatening. If VT occurs again, it may compromise cardiac output and lead to hemodynamic instability.

3. Congestive heart failure: The patient's elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level suggests possible atrial overload, indicating that his heart is under strain. If left untreated, this can progress to worsening heart failure and further compromise cardiac function.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and presence of hyaline casts in urine suggest pre-renal acute kidney injury. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to further deterioration of renal function.

5. Anion gap acidosis: Although the patient's anion gap acidosis has"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 M with dialated cardiomyopathy s/p AICD placement admitted for
   hypovolemic hypotension.
   .
   HYPOTENSION - Multiple potential causes exist for his hypotension.  He
   was well diuresed, coming in 2 lbs over dry weight following 1.5 L
   resuscitation in the ED.  He was also discharged on increased
   beta-blockade.  The absence of p-waves on his EKG raises the
   possibility of atrial-venous asynchrony.  He has reduced cardiac output
   from cardiomyopathy.  He is on chronic steroids and could have a
   component of adrenal insufficiency.  Although he had a recent
   infection, this was treated with broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and
   he has no signs of infection.  No evidence of active ischemia or
   cardiogenic shock.  Lactate is non-specific.  PE unlikely given
   therapeutic INR, but would consider if hypotension persists.
   - hold antihypertensives, would discharge on lower BB dose.
   - no antibiotics for now
   - follow blood, urine, sputum cultures, fever curve, white count.
   - PA and lateral CXR
   - trend lactate
   - wean levophed
   - consider swan-catheter to eval volume status and cardiac function in
   AM
   .
   VENTRICULAR ARRYTHMIA: History of VT in the setting of volume
   overload.  Also, scheduled for ablation on Monday.
   - hold coumadin in preparation for ablation
   - monitor on tele
   - Will make EP aware.
   CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Was likely at or below dry weight on
   admission, now up 1.5 L.  Elevated BNP, JVP, CVP.
   - will diurese gently with Lasix 60 mg daily.
   COPD: Does not appear to be in acute flair
   - Advair/Spireva/Prednisone
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: On last admission, Cr improved
   initially with lasix and then increased.  Now elevated well over
   baseline.  Urine shows hyaline casts.  FeUrea 35%.  All consistent with
   pre-renal.
   - Watch Cr with rehydration
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Resolved on admission to CCU following fluid
   resuscitation with falling lactate.
   # FEN: Cardiac diet
   # ACCESS: PIV's, Central line
   # PROPHYLAXIS: Theraputic INR, Colase & Senna, add SQ heparin if INR <

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy who was admitted to the ICU for hypovolemic hypotension. He has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. HYPOTENSION: The patient has multiple potential causes for his hypotension, including overdiuresis, increased beta-blockade, reduced cardiac output from cardiomyopathy, chronic steroid use leading to adrenal insufficiency, and no evidence of active infection or cardiogenic shock.

2. VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIA: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia in the setting of volume overload and is scheduled for ablation on Monday. The plan is to hold Coumadin in preparation for ablation and monitor the patient on telemetry.

3. CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: The patient was likely at or below dry weight on admission but is now up 1.5 liters. He has elevated BNP, JVP, and CVP. The plan is to diurese gently with Lasix 60 mg daily.

4. COPD: The patient does not appear to be in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His current medications include Advair, Spireva, and Prednisone.

5. ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: The patient's serum creatinine has worsened over time, with recent values of 2.5, 2"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who was admitted for hypovolemic hypotension. He has been diagnosed with various medical conditions including ventricular arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, COPD, acute on chronic renal failure, and anion gap acidosis. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 99/61 mmHg, and he is on Lasix drip and Lopressor 25mg. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 96%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with an irregularly irregular rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a 1-2/6 systolic murmur at LLSB without radiation. 

His labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low sodium, high potassium, and low magnesium. 

The patient's plan includes continuing Lopressor and Losartan, discontinuing Lasix gtt and starting it orally, decreasing Lopressor if SBPs persistently below 90, and following blood and urine cultures. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension, further deterioration of renal function, development of new cardiac arrhythmias, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy who was admitted for hypovolemic hypotension. He has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of volume overload and continues to experience VT and ectopy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/61 mmHg to 81/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals a supple neck with jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 10 cm, point of maximal impulse (PMI) located in the 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line, irregularly irregular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2, and a 1-2/6 systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border without radiation. The patient also has wheezes in the lungs, a soft abdomen, and no femoral bruits.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, decreased hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, as well as abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 88 mg/dL and 156 mg/dL.

Plan:
- Continue digoxin and increase mexiletine"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy who was admitted for hypovolemic hypotension. The patient had several medical complications during his stay in the ICU.

1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which has since resolved. The plan is to continue Lopressor (25mg) and Losartan (12.5mg) and discontinue Lasix gtt if the patient's blood pressure remains below 90mmHg.

2. Ventricular Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the setting of volume overload. Possible ablation is planned for Monday. The plan is to hold Coumadin in preparation for ablation and monitor the patient on tele.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's CHF is stable, and the plan is to start oral Lasix to achieve a goal of even fluid balance.

4. COPD: The patient does not appear to be in an acute flare of COPD. The plan is to add Xopenex to the current regimen of Advair/Spireva/Prednisone.

5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is improving, and the plan is to monitor the creatinine level.
