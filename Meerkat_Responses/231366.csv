","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of traumatic brain injury presenting with positional tachycardia and hypertension of unclear etiology. She has shown orthostatic changes with large overshoot BP response. The patient experienced convulsions with an episode of hypotension but remained alert and communicative throughout. There are no acute events since admission to the MICU. The patient has allergies to prochlorperazine and an unknown allergy. She is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Vital signs show a wide range of heart rate (64-169 bpm), blood pressure (55-150/45-90 mmHg), respiratory rate (10-29 breaths per minute), and temperature within normal limits. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a total input of 1,217 mL, output of 1,300 mL, with a balance of -83 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery with SpO2 at 98%. ABG results are pending. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and normal cardiovascular findings. Neurological examination shows attentive behavior, normal speech, and intact cranial nerves.

Lab results include white blood cell count of 5.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, glucose level of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of traumatic brain injury, presenting with positional tachycardia and hypertension of unclear etiology. She exhibits orthostatic changes, possibly related to volume depletion or autonomic insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of her symptoms. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Postural Hemodynamic Changes: The patient's orthostatic testing in the ICU showed evidence of orthostasis, which may be due to volume depletion or autonomic insufficiency. This can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting if not properly managed.
2. Pheochromocytoma: Given the episodic tachycardia and hypertension, pheochromocytoma should be considered as a potential cause. This is a rare tumor that secretes excess catecholamines, leading to episodes of high blood pressure and rapid heartbeat.
3. Carcinoid Syndrome: The patient's recent history of diarrhea alternating with constipation, along with tachycardia and hypertension, raises suspicion for carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid tumors can secrete serotonin and other substances, causing flushing, diarrhea, and cardiac abnormalities.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of head trauma and seizures warrants further neurological evaluation. Imaging studies such as an MRI and EEG are recommended to assess for any underlying neurological conditions.
5. Intestinal Bowel Syndrome (IBS):"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male who presented with an episode of altered mental status and was evaluated by the neurology team. They recommended several interventions, including a head CT, admitting the patient to the ICU on telemetry, keeping the bed flat, and considering an MRI Brain with contrast when more stable. The patient also has a history of pheochromocytoma, and further evaluation for this condition is recommended. Additionally, the patient may require repeating EMG and performing LP to evaluate for Guillain-Barré syndrome. The patient has allergies to prochlorperazine and unknown medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate ranging from 60-159 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 70-158/45-108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on various infusions and medications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pheochromocytoma: This is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that can cause episodes of hypertension, tachycardia, and palpitations. It may require further evaluation and management.

2. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS): This is a neurological disorder characterized by muscle weakness and paralysis. The patient's history of autonomic dysfunction and the recommendation for repeating EMG and performing LP suggest a possible evaluation"

   #. Postural Hemodynamic Changes - On orthostatic testing in ICU pt had
   evidence of orthostatsis. Most likely related to volume depletion vs
   autonomic insufficiency. Given minimal hemodynamic data available from
   prior events, it is difficult to fully assess however it is possible
   her BP was measured during her recovery phase from orthostasis when it
   was found to be elevated. If HD prove unrelated to orthostasis on
   repeat testing also consider etiologies of episodic tachycardia
   including pheochromocytoma, carcinoid (pt with recent history of
   diarrhea alternating with constipation, denies flushing)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient has experienced episodes of orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, and hypertension. Neurology has evaluated the patient for autonomics and recommends further testing including a head CT, admitting the patient to the ICU on telemetry, keeping the bed flat, and considering an MRI brain with contrast when more stable. Additionally, the neurology team suggests following up with OSH labs for pheo, repeating EMG, and performing LP to evaluate for Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).

The patient has allergies to prochlorperazine and an unknown allergy. They have received various infusions and are on other ICU medications. There are no significant changes to the patient's medical or family history.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), current temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate ranging from 60 to 159 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 70/45 mmHg to 158/95 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 10 to 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%.

   Assessment and Plan
   #. Postural Hemodynamic Changes
 Pt has had multiple episodes of CP,
   tachycardia, and HTN, both when supine, and with elevation. While the
   events seem can be precipitated by postural changes, they do not
   require them. The episodes have a significant component of chest pain,
   substernal, [**8-27**], nonradiating, that will slowly decrease after
   episodes has resolved. Pt has been observed to develop signs of pain
   before hemodynamic changes, though the two evens happen closeThe
   differential includes Pheochromocytoma, POTS, carcinoid, GBS w/
   autonomic dysreflexia, psuedopheochromocytoma, and Cardiac.
   -Pheochromocytoma is unlikey with a negative test for serum
   metanephrines (from OSH).  Serum metanephrines are the test with the
   highest specificity for pheochromocytoma (97%). 24h Urine metanephrines
   and catecholamines have greater specificity, and are pending from OSH.
   Additionally CT-Abd at the OSH showed normal kidnesy and adrenals.
   There was normal per-appendiceal regions. There was a small density in
   the appendix that is likely a fecolith. Will follow up remaining labs.
   If other tests are all negative will consider re-evaluation of the
   appendix.
   -Carcinoid: reassuring CT-abd. Will send HIAA
   -GBS: had a normal EMG at the OSH, will consider repeat EMG or LP if
   other studies continue to be negative.
   -Intracranial process: Had negative HD CT x 2. Will have head MRI here.
   -PE/Dissection/pulmonary/pleuritic process: negative CT-[**MD Number(3) 856**]
   - CAD unlikely w/ stable CEs at multiple points, Normal EKGs, and no
   EKGs during episodes.
   - Cardiac structural/mass: ECHO today.
   - Will have Octreatide scan which may be able to find rare
   pheochromocytomas or carcinoid tumors, e.g intra cardiac.
   - Consider psychiatric related diagnoses after all testing is completed
   (e.g. panic disorder, paroxysmal hypertension, factitious disorder),
   consider psychiatry eval if all studies are negative.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple episodes of chest pain, tachycardia, and hypertension, both when supine and with elevation. These episodes do not require postural changes to occur. The differential diagnosis includes pheochromocytoma, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), carcinoid, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with autonomic dysreflexia, pseudo-pheochromocytoma, and cardiac causes.

The assessment and plan include ruling out each of these conditions. Pheochromocytoma is considered unlikely with a negative test for serum metanephrines. Further tests, such as 24-hour urine metanephrines and catecholamines, are pending. A CT abdomen showed normal kidneys and adrenals, and there was no evidence of an appendiceal mass.

Carcinoid syndrome is also being considered, but reassuring CT findings are mentioned. The plan includes sending a sample for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (HIAA) analysis.

GBS is being evaluated, but the patient had a normal EMG at an outside hospital, and a repeat EMG or lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered if other studies continue to be negative.

An intracranial process has been ruled out with negative head CT scans. A head MRI will be performed locally to further evaluate this possibility.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is currently resting comfortably in the ICU. They have a history of head trauma and seizures, and there is no evidence of acute distress. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in blood pressure. They have experienced multiple episodes of chest pain, substernal, non-radiating, which decreases after the episodes resolve. The patient also exhibits signs of pain before hemodynamic changes occur. 

The differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms includes pheochromocytoma, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), carcinoid syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with autonomic dysreflexia, pseudopheochromocytoma, and cardiac causes. 

Several tests have been conducted to rule out these conditions. The serum metanephrines test was negative, indicating an unlikely diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. A CT scan of the abdomen showed normal kidneys and adrenals, ruling out an adrenal tumor. The CT scan also revealed a small density in the appendix, which is likely a fecolith. Additional labs will be sent for further evaluation. 

Other tests that are pending include 24-hour urine metanephrines and catecholamines, HIAA (5-HIAA), and an octreotide scan. An MRI of the head is planned to assess for any intracranial processes. An ech"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 21F remote head injury now with five day
   history of positional neurologic symptoms in the setting of
   hypertension and tachycardia. Continues to have reproducible episodes
   triggered by sitting up resulting in tachycardia and previously noted
   hypertension.  Team took BP last night before and immediately after
   sitting up and found hypotension immediately upon sitting up with
   development of hypertension in minutes subsequent to that.   Pt only
   notes tape related rash with no other complaints as long as she doesn
   sit up.  Pt had MRI yesterday

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of remote head injury and recent symptoms of positional neurologic symptoms, hypertension, and tachycardia. The patient's symptoms are triggered by sitting up and include reproducible episodes of tachycardia and previously noted hypertension. The team observed hypotension immediately upon sitting up, which developed into hypertension in minutes subsequently.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate between 60-155 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/50-122/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress.

Physical examination findings include a normal cardiovascular examination with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, clear lung sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no edema in the extremities. Neurological examination shows intact cranial nerves, strength in upper and lower extremities, and intact finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin coordination.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus), and liver function tests. However, there is a slightly elevated D-dimer level of 169 ng/mL.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient's"

   #. Postural Hemodynamic Changes
 Pt has had multiple episodes of CP,
   tachycardia, and HTN, both when supine, and with elevation. While the
   events seem can be precipitated by postural changes, they do not
   require them. The episodes have a significant component of chest pain,
   substernal, [**8-27**], nonradiating, that will slowly decrease after
   episodes has resolved. Pt has been observed to develop signs of pain
   before hemodynamic changes, though the two evens happen closeThe

   autonomic dysreflexia, psuedopheochromocytoma, and Cardiac.

   metanephrines (from OSH).  Serum metanephrines are the test with the

   and catecholamines have greater specificity, and are pending from OSH.
   Additionally CT-Abd at the OSH showed normal kidnesy and adrenals.
   There was normal per-appendiceal regions. There was a small density in
   the appendix that is likely a fecolith. Will follow up remaining labs.
   If other tests are all negative will consider re-evaluation of the
   appendix.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with an undiagnosed condition causing episodes of chest pain, tachycardia, hypertension, and postural changes. The differential diagnosis includes pheochromocytoma, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), carcinoid syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with autonomic dysreflexia, pseudo-pheochromocytoma, and cardiac causes.

The patient has undergone several tests and evaluations so far, including an MRI, CT scan of the abdomen, EKGs, and blood tests. The results of these tests have been mostly negative, ruling out some of the potential diagnoses. Specifically, a negative test for serum metanephrines suggests that pheochromocytoma is unlikely. A CT scan of the abdomen also showed normal kidneys and adrenals, as well as a small density in the appendix that is likely a fecolith.

Other potential causes such as GBS, intracranial processes, pulmonary embolism or dissection, and coronary artery disease have been ruled out based on EMG results, HD CT scans, and EKGs. The patient's cardiac structure and mass will be further evaluated with an echo.

An octreotide scan has been ordered, which may be able to detect rare pheochromocytomas or carcinoid tumors, for example, intra-cardiac."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 21-year-old female with an unchanged review of systems from admission. The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia, chest tightness, and rhythmic jerking of all four extremities, which resolved after receiving 1 mg of Ativan and 1 mg of morphine IV. The neuro c/s suggests that pain could be the primary problem causing other symptoms, and further evaluation for chest pathology with a CT scan is recommended.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 107/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is well-nourished and resting comfortably supine, with no acute distress. Physical examination findings are unremarkable except for a mild flow murmur at the left sternal border.

Laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. The patient has a slightly low hematocrit level of 33.8%. Other lab tests including liver function tests, kidney function tests, cardiac markers, and blood gases are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Postural Hemodynamic Changes: The patient has had multiple episodes of chest pain, tachycardia, and hypertension, both when supine and with elevation"

   Assessment and Plan
   #. Postural Hemodynamic Changes
 Pt has had multiple episodes of CP,
   tachycardia, and HTN, both when supine, and with elevation. While the
   events seem can be precipitated by postural changes, they do not
   require them. The episodes have a significant component of chest pain,
   substernal, [**8-27**], nonradiating, that will slowly decrease after
   episodes has resolved. Pt has been observed to develop signs of pain
   before hemodynamic changes, though the two evens happen closeThe
   differential includes Pheochromocytoma, POTS, carcinoid, GBS w/
   autonomic dysreflexia, psuedopheochromocytoma, and Cardiac.
   -Pheochromocytoma is unlikey with a negative test for serum
   metanephrines (from OSH).  Serum metanephrines are the test with the
   highest specificity for pheochromocytoma (97%). 24h Urine metanephrines
   and catecholamines have greater specificity, and are pending from OSH.
   Additionally CT-Abd at the OSH showed normal kidnesy and adrenals.
   There was normal per-appendiceal regions. There was a small density in
   the appendix that is likely a fecolith. Will follow up remaining labs.
   If other tests are all negative will consider re-evaluation of the
   appendix.
   -Carcinoid: reassuring CT-abd. Will send HIAA
   -GBS: had a normal EMG at the OSH, will consider repeat EMG or LP if
   other studies continue to be negative.
   -Intracranial process: Had negative HD CT x 2. Will have head MRI here.
   -PE/Dissection/pulmonary/pleuritic process: negative CT-[**MD Number(3) 856**]
   - CAD unlikely w/ stable CEs at multiple points, Normal EKGs, and no
   EKGs during episodes.
   - Cardiac structural/mass: ECHO today.
   - Will have Octreatide scan which may be able to find rare
   pheochromocytomas or carcinoid tumors, e.g intra cardiac.

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is an episode of tachycardia unprovoked by positional change, accompanied by chest tightness and rhythmic jerking of all four extremities. This episode was resolved with the administration of ativan and morphine IV.

The patient has a history of allergies to prochlorperazine and unknown allergies. They have been receiving various infusions and ICU medications, but no specific names are mentioned.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent episode. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/61 mmHg to 150/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates sinus bradycardia, and there are no abnormalities noted in their fluid balance. The respiratory support shows an SpO2 of 97% and unspecified ABG results.

Physical examination reveals that peripheral vascular pulses could not be assessed, skin was not assessed, and neurologic examination showed responses, movement, tone, and other parameters not assessed.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 21F remote head injury now with five day
   history of positional neurologic symptoms in the setting of
   hypertension and tachycardia. Pt continues to have reproducible
   episodes triggered by sitting up resulting in tachycardia and
   previously noted hypertension.  Several more episodes since yesterday-
   checks sub 30 sec into symptoms reveal HTN accompanying chest pressure
   (non reproducible), tachycardia.  One event happened while very
   gradually raising HOB over period of ~30min (at approx 30degrees).

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pheochromocytoma: The patient's episodes of chest tightness, tachycardia, and hypertension could be indicative of a pheochromocytoma, which is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that can cause excessive production of catecholamines.

2. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS): The patient's symptoms triggered by sitting up may suggest POTS, a condition characterized by excessive increases in heart rate upon standing.

3. Carcinoid syndrome: The patient's symptoms could also be related to carcinoid syndrome, which occurs when carcinoid tumors release hormones into the bloodstream.

4. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS): GBS is a rare disorder where the body's immune system attacks the nerves, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. The patient's history of a remote head injury raises suspicion for GBS.

5. Intracranial process: The patient's symptoms could be caused by an underlying intracranial process such as a mass or infection.

6. Cardiac issues: The patient's episodes of chest tightness and hypertension could be related to cardiac problems such as coronary artery disease (CAD) or structural abnormalities.

7. Seizures: The patient's episodes could potentially be seizures, which may be triggered by positional changes.

8. Psychiatric-related diagnoses: If all testing is negative"

   Assessment and Plan
   #. Postural Hemodynamic Changes
 Pt has had multiple episodes of CP,
   tachycardia, and HTN, both when supine, and with elevation. While the
   events seem can be precipitated by postural changes, they do not
   require them. The episodes have a significant component of chest pain,
   substernal, [**8-27**], nonradiating, that will slowly decrease after
   episodes has resolved. Pt has been observed to develop signs of pain
   before hemodynamic changes, though the two evens happen closeThe
   differential includes Pheochromocytoma, POTS, carcinoid, GBS w/
   autonomic dysreflexia, psuedopheochromocytoma, and Cardiac.
   -Pheochromocytoma is unlikey with a negative test for serum
   metanephrines (from OSH).  Serum metanephrines are the test with the
   highest specificity for pheochromocytoma (97%). 24h Urine metanephrines
   and catecholamines have greater specificity, and are pending from OSH.
   Additionally CT-Abd at the OSH showed normal kidnesy and adrenals.
   There was normal per-appendiceal regions. There was a small density in
   the appendix that is likely a fecolith. Will follow up remaining labs.
   If other tests are all negative will consider re-evaluation of the
   appendix.
   -Carcinoid: reassuring CT-abd. HIAA pending.
   -GBS: had a normal EMG at the OSH, will consider repeat EMG or LP if
   other studies continue to be negative.
   -Intracranial process: Had negative HD CT x 2. MRI yesterday normal
   (two cystic structures, chronic arachnoid cysts)
   -PE/Dissection/pulmonary/pleuritic process: negative CT-[**MD Number(3) 856**],
   normal CXRs, normal sats,
   - CAD unlikely w/ stable CEs at multiple points, Normal EKGs, and no
   EKGs during episodes.
   - Cardiac structural/mass: ECHO yesterday was normal.
   - Will have Octreatide scan which may be able to find rare
   pheochromocytomas or carcinoid tumors, e.g intra cardiac.
   - Seizure, unlikely, but does have mild post-episode fatigue,
   ?post-ictal symptoms. Consider EEG.
   - Consider psychiatric related diagnoses after all testing is completed
   (e.g. panic disorder, paroxysmal hypertension, factitious disorder),
   consider psychiatry eval if all studies are negative.
   - Neurology following - appreciate recs
   - Cardiology following - appreciate recs
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u remaining studies and tests (OCTREOTIDE , 24 Urine MN,CCA, HIAA,
   review OSH reports)
   - will attempt to sit up
 recheck orthostatics
   - send lyme serologies

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple episodes of cardiac pulmonary arrest (CP), tachycardia, and hypertension. The patient has a known allergy to Prochlorperazine and has been receiving various medications including Lorazepam, Morphine sulfate, and Heparin sodium.

Vital signs as of 06:57 AM on 10/16/2141 show a temperature of 36.1 C (97 F), heart rate between 63-159 bpm with a current reading of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 56-163/111 mmHg with a current reading of 89/46 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-32 breaths per minute with a current reading of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increase in fluid balance with a total input of 1,080 mL and output of 2,400 mL since 12 AM.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 272 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin at 12.9 g/dL, normal platelet count at 87 mg/dL, slightly low sodium level at 0.8 mg/dL, normal potassium level at 24 mEq/L, slightly elevated chloride level at 3.8 mEq/L, normal bicarbonate level at 8 mg/dL, slightly elevated magnesium level at 103 mEq/L, normal calcium level at 135 mEq/L, and slightly elevated serum creatinine level at 34.1%.

Other lab values include elevated D-dimer at 169 ng/mL, normal albumin level at 4.0 g/dL, and normal calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T) are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings include an undetermined heart rhythm, non-assessed peripheral vascular pulses, and non-assessed neurologic status. The patient's skin, respiratory support, and ABG results are not assessed.

The patient is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient has already experienced multiple episodes of CP, which indicates a potential risk for further cardiac arrests.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently low, indicating a risk for hypotension and potential organ damage.
3. Fluid overload: The increased fluid balance with more output than input suggests the possibility of fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema or heart failure.
4. Infection: The elevated leukocyte count and the prophylactic treatment for VAP may indicate an increased risk of infection.
5. Thromboembolic events: The prophylactic treatment for DVT suggests a concern for thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism."

   Assessment and Plan
   #. Postural Hemodynamic Changes
 Pt has had multiple episodes of CP,
   tachycardia, and HTN, both when supine, and with elevation. While the
   events seem can be precipitated by postural changes, they do not
   require them. The episodes have a significant component of chest pain,
   substernal, [**8-27**], nonradiating, that will slowly decrease after
   episodes has resolved. Pt has been observed to develop signs of pain
   before hemodynamic changes, though the two evens happen closeThe
   differential includes Pheochromocytoma, POTS, carcinoid, GBS w/
   autonomic dysreflexia, psuedopheochromocytoma, and Cardiac.
   -Pheochromocytoma is unlikey with a negative test for serum
   metanephrines (from OSH).  Serum metanephrines are the test with the
   highest specificity for pheochromocytoma (97%). 24h Urine metanephrines
   and catecholamines have greater specificity, and are pending from OSH.
   Additionally CT-Abd at the OSH showed normal kidnesy and adrenals.
   There was normal per-appendiceal regions. There was a small density in
   the appendix that is likely a fecolith. Will follow up remaining labs.
   If other tests are all negative will consider re-evaluation of the
   appendix.
   -Carcinoid: reassuring CT-abd. HIAA pending.
   -GBS: had a normal EMG at the OSH, will consider repeat EMG or LP if
   other studies continue to be negative.
   -Intracranial process: Had negative HD CT x 2. MRI yesterday normal
   (two cystic structures, chronic arachnoid cysts)
   -PE/Dissection/pulmonary/pleuritic process: negative CT-[**MD Number(3) 856**],
   normal CXRs, normal sats,
   - CAD unlikely w/ stable CEs at multiple points, Normal EKGs, and no
   EKGs during episodes.
   - Cardiac structural/mass: ECHO yesterday was normal.
   - Will have Octreatide scan which may be able to find rare
   pheochromocytomas or carcinoid tumors, e.g intra cardiac.
   - Seizure, unlikely, but does have mild post-episode fatigue,
   ?post-ictal symptoms. Consider EEG.
   - Consider psychiatric related diagnoses after all testing is completed
   (e.g. panic disorder, paroxysmal hypertension, factitious disorder),
   consider psychiatry eval if all studies are negative.
   - Neurology following - appreciate recs
   - Cardiology following - appreciate recs
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u remaining studies and tests (OCTREOTIDE , 24 Urine MN,CCA, HIAA,
   review OSH reports)

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female admitted to the ICU with multiple episodes of chest pain (CP), tachycardia, and hypertension. The episodes occur both when supine and with elevation, and there is a significant component of chest pain that decreases after the episodes resolve. The patient also experiences mild post-episode fatigue. The differential diagnosis includes pheochromocytoma, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), carcinoid syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with autonomic dysreflexia, pseudopheochromocytoma, and cardiac causes.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Postural Hemodynamic Changes: The patient has had multiple episodes of CP, tachycardia, and HTN, which can be precipitated by postural changes but do not require them. The episodes are associated with chest pain that decreases after they resolve. The patient is being observed for signs of pain before hemodynamic changes occur.
2. Other Diagnoses:
   - Pheochromocytoma: Negative test for serum metanephrines, 24-hour urine metanephrines and catecholamines pending, CT-Abd showed normal kidneys and adrenals.
   - Carcinoid Syndrome: Reassuring CT-abd, HIAA pending.
   - GBS: Normal EMG at the OSH, repeat EMG or LP if other"

   #. Postural Hemodynamic Changes
 Pt has had multiple episodes of CP,
   tachycardia, and HTN, both when supine, and with elevation. While the
   events seem can be precipitated by postural changes, they do not
   require them. The episodes have a significant component of chest pain,
   substernal, [**8-27**], nonradiating, that will slowly decrease after
   episodes has resolved. Pt has been observed to develop signs of pain
   before hemodynamic changes, though the two evens happen closeThe
   differential includes Pheochromocytoma, POTS, carcinoid, GBS w/
   autonomic dysreflexia, psuedopheochromocytoma, and Cardiac.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for acute chest pain. She has a history of multiple episodes of chest pain, tachycardia, and hypertension, both when supine and with elevation. The events seem to be precipitated by postural changes but do not require them. The patient also experienced substernal chest pain that subsided after receiving morphine.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 93/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on mechanical ventilation with 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.

Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight decrease in blood pressure from 120's to 93/61 mmHg. Fluid balance is positive with a total intake of 1,800 mL and output of 4,100 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,300 mL. The patient has received 1 mg of ativan and 1 mg of morphine sulfate for acute chest pain.

Laboratory results indicate normal WBC count, Hct, Plt, Cr, Glucose, and other electrolyte levels. The patient's D-dimer level is elevated at 169 ng/mL. Imaging studies, including a CT scan of the abdomen, have revealed a small density in the appendix that is likely a fecolith.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Postural Hemodynamic Changes: The patient has had multiple episodes of chest pain, tachycardia, and hypertension, which may be related to postural changes. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Pheochromocytoma: The patient's symptoms are suggestive of pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes excess catecholamines. However, a negative test for serum metanephrines makes this diagnosis less likely. Additional testing is required.
3. Carcinoid: A CT scan of the abdomen showed no evidence of carcinoid tumor.
4. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS): The patient's normal EMG makes GBS an unlikely diagnosis. Repeat EMG or LP may be considered if other studies are negative.
5. Intracranial Process: Two head CT scans and an MRI have revealed chronic arachnoid cysts but no signs of an intracranial process.
6. Pulmonary Embolism/Dissection: A CT pulmonary angiography was negative, and the patient's oxygen saturation remains normal.
7. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's stable cardiac enzymes and normal EKGs make CAD unlikely.
8. Cardiac Structural/Mass: An echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities.
9. Seizure: The patient's symptoms could be consistent with a seizure, but further evaluation, including an EEG, is necessary.
10. Psychiatric Disorders: Once all medical causes are ruled out, psychiatric disorders, such as panic disorder or factitious disorder, may be considered.
11. Neurology and Cardiology Follow-up: The patient will be followed up by neurology and cardiology for further evaluation and recommendations.
12. Telemetry: The patient will continue to be monitored on telemetry.
13. Follow-up Studies: The patient is awaiting results from an octreotide scan, 24-hour urine metanephrines, catecholamines, HIAA, and review of OSH reports.
14. Sitting Up: The patient will be encouraged to sit up and recheck orthostatics.
15. Lyme Serologies: Lyme serologies will be sent.
16. Head Trauma/Seizure: The patient's history of head trauma and seizure is noted, but further evaluation is not currently indicated.
17. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): The patient's IBS does not seem active at this time.
18. Fluid and Electrolyte Management: The patient will be monitored closely for fluid and electrolyte balance.
19. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels will be monitored regularly.
20. Access: The patient has a peripheral IV line and heparin subcutaneous prophylaxis.
21. Code Status: The patient is full code.
22. Disposition: The patient will remain in the ICU for further evaluation and may be transferred to the floor if stable.

   #. Postural Hemodynamic Changes
 Pt has had multiple episodes of CP,
   tachycardia, and HTN, both when supine, and with elevation. While the
   events seem can be precipitated by postural changes, they do not
   require them. The episodes have a significant component of chest pain,
   substernal, [**8-27**], nonradiating, that will slowly decrease after
   episodes has resolved. Pt has been observed to develop signs of pain
   before hemodynamic changes, though the two evens happen closeThe
   differential includes Pheochromocytoma, POTS, carcinoid, GBS w/
   autonomic dysreflexia, psuedopheochromocytoma, and Cardiac.
   -Pheochromocytoma is unlikey with a negative test for serum
   metanephrines (from OSH).  Serum metanephrines are the test with the
   highest specificity for pheochromocytoma (97%). 24h Urine metanephrines
   and catecholamines have greater specificity, and are pending from OSH.
   Additionally CT-Abd at the OSH showed normal kidnesy and adrenals.
   There was normal per-appendiceal regions. There was a small density in
   the appendix that is likely a fecolith. Will follow up remaining labs.
   If other tests are all negative will consider re-evaluation of the
   appendix.
   -Carcinoid: reassuring CT-abd. HIAA pending.
   -GBS: had a normal EMG at the OSH, will consider repeat EMG or LP if
   other studies continue to be negative.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old female who presented to the ICU with acute chest pain. She experienced multiple episodes of chest pain, tachycardia, and hypertension, both when supine and with elevation. The patient's pain is substernal, nonradiating, and slowly decreases after the episodes resolve. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 59 bpm (normal range: 55-92 bpm), blood pressure of 93/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a history of head trauma, seizure, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She has undergone several tests, including a nuclear medicine scan, CT abdomen, MRI, EKGs, and echocardiogram, which have all come back negative for any significant abnormalities. The patient is currently being monitored for potential medical complications, such as pheochromocytoma, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), carcinoid syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), cardiac issues, seizure disorder, and psychiatric conditions. Further testing is planned to evaluate these possibilities, including an octreotide scan, repeat urine metanephrines, catecholamines, and histamine, as well as a barium swallow to evaluate for esophage"

   differential includes Pheochromocytoma, POTS, carcinoid, GBS w/
   autonomic dysreflexia, psuedopheochromocytoma, and Cardiac.
   -Pheochromocytoma is unlikey with a negative test for serum
   metanephrines (from OSH).  Serum metanephrines are the test with the
   highest specificity for pheochromocytoma (97%). 24h Urine metanephrines
   and catecholamines have greater specificity, and are pending from OSH.
   Additionally CT-Abd at the OSH showed normal kidnesy and adrenals.
   There was normal per-appendiceal regions. There was a small density in
   the appendix that is likely a fecolith. Will follow up remaining labs.
   If other tests are all negative will consider re-evaluation of the
   appendix.
   -Carcinoid: reassuring CT-abd. Octreotide scan negative
   -GBS: had a normal EMG at the OSH, will consider repeat EMG or LP if
   other studies continue to be negative.
   -Intracranial process: Had negative HD CT x 2. MRI normal (two cystic
   structures, chronic arachnoid cysts)
   -PE/Dissection/pulmonary/pleuritic process: negative CT-[**MD Number(3) 856**],
   normal CXRs, normal sats,
   - CAD unlikely w/ stable CEs at multiple points, Normal EKGs, and no
   EKGs during episodes.
   - Cardiac structural/mass: ECHO yesterday was normal.
   - Octreotide scan which may be able to find rare pheochromocytomas or
   carcinoid tumors.
   - Seizure, unlikely, but does have mild post-episode fatigue,

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a chief complaint of postural hemodynamic changes, including episodes of chest pain, tachycardia, and hypertension. These episodes occur when the patient is in a standing position and can also happen without postural changes. The differential diagnosis includes pheochromocytoma, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), carcinoid syndrome, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with autonomic dysreflexia, pseudopheochromocytoma, and cardiac causes. Initial testing has ruled out pheochromocytoma, GBS, and carcinoid syndrome. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pheochromocytoma: A pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that can cause episodes of hypertension, tachycardia, and chest pain. It is usually located in the adrenal glands.
2. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS): POTS is a condition characterized by excessive tachycardia upon standing. Symptoms may include lightheadedness, fatigue, and chest pain.
3. Carcinoid Syndrome: Carcinoid syndrome occurs when carcinoid tumors release hormones into the bloodstream. Symptoms can include flushing, diarrhea, and chest pain.
4. Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) with Aut"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of allergies to prochlorperazine and unknown antibiotics. He has been started on prophylactic antibiotics (PPi) and morphine for pain management. The patient experienced two episodes of chest pain (CP) and hypertension yesterday, with the last episode lasting longer. The nursing staff provided Ativan without morphine during this episode. The patient's neurologic signs-off, vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and oxygenation are within normal limits. The patient's peripheral vascular examination, skin examination, and neurologic examination are not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently below the normal range, indicating hypotension. This may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Chest pain: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of chest pain, which could be indicative of myocardial ischemia or other cardiac issues. Further investigation is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Hypertension: The patient had an episode of hypertension, which could be a result of pain, stress, or an underlying medical condition. Monitoring and management of blood pressure are crucial to prevent complications such as hemorrhagic stroke or end-organ damage.
4. Infection: The patient has been"
