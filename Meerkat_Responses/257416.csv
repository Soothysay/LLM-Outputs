   81 yof with multiple medical problems including diastolic HF with
   severe aortic stensosis, atrial flutter not on anti-coagulation, COPD
   and prior right sided MCA ischemic stroke presenting with altered MS
   and left sided deficits.
   # Altered Mental Status / Confusion: per daughter, this is an acute
   change from her prior baseline with focal left sided deficits c/w prior
   right sided MCA CVA.  Possible etiologies of altered mental status
   include infection, metabolic derangement, stroke, seizure in territory
   of prior CVA.  Patient also with serially elevated TN

   - f/u pancultures
 urine, blood
   - serial CXR to evaluate development of RLL infiltrate
   - f/u MRI/MRA neck brain to evaluate for new infarct
   - f/u EEG to rule out subclinical status in territory of prior CVA
   eliciting focal neurological signs
   - would treat at this point for presumed PNA given reported increased
   cough, abnormal appearing CXR a/w with MS change
   # Presume CAP:  patient presented with AMS change with recent history
   of increasing respiratory distress and cough and possible infiltrate on
   CXR.  Although imaging and clinical exam is not convincing, her history
   and association with MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 10533**] empiric treatment..
   - switch to ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP as levoquin can alter
   mental status in elderly
   - titrate O2 requirements to comfort
   - follow serial CXR, fever curve, WBC
   # Left sided weakness/hypertonicity: focal neurological deficits
   concerning for repeat CVA vs. seizure (subclinical status).
   - f/u MRI read
   - f/u EEG report
   - f/u neuro recommendations pending the above information
   - continue ASA in setting of NSTEMI and possibility of embolic CVA in
   setting of AFlutter
   # Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure/Severe AS:  patient currently appears
   euvolemic or dry
   - start maintenance fluids but avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation in
   setting severe AS and risk of pulmonary flash
   # COPD:  decreasing oxygen requirement but history of cough, sputum
   production and shortness of breath also c/w COPD exacerbation.
   - continue ipratroprium and albuterol nebs
   - treat pneumonia as above
   # Elevated troponin:  ECG not suggestive of myocardial ischemia however
   cardiac enzymes suggestive of myocardial injury.  This may suggest
   prior MI in recent days given q waves on ECG and plateaud troponins.
   This may also be c/w NSTEMI.
   - continue ASA
   - hold anticoagulation for concern of CVA
   - holding BB as patient is NPO, normotensive and r/o dropping pressure

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old individual with multiple medical conditions including diastolic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, atrial flutter, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of right-sided middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke. The patient presented with altered mental status, left-sided deficits, and concerns for stroke, acute myocardial infarction/NSTEMI, and pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 72/47 mmHg to 156/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 45.8 kg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 2,200 mL and output of 170 mL. The patient is receiving minimal fluids and oxygen support.

The patient has undergone an MRI of the head and is currently alert but disoriented to time and place. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm without murmurs, soft abdomen, and no focal neurological deficits. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated troponin T level. Imaging shows a small right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis on chest X-ray.

 small right pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old female with multiple medical problems including diastolic
   heart failure, atrial flutter, severe AS, COPD, and a previous right
   sided MCA stroke presenting with altered mental status and left sided
   deficits.
   Obtundation/Confusion: Patient's picture is most consistent for
   encephalopathy with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 42**] consciousness and responsiveness
   as well as context in general medical illness.  Multiple possible
   etiologies for this patient's encephalopathy including most likely
   infection  versus CVA versus epileptiform activity versus ACS.  We will
   attempt to maximize her status by treating her probable pulmonary
   infection as continuing diagnostic work-up for CVA, epileptic event, or
   cardiac event.  Large intracranial hemorrhage ruled out by negative CT
   and large territory ischemic/embolic CVA would likely show some changes
   on CT.
   -Treat pneumonia (see below)
   -MRI/MRA neck of brain to evaluate for stroke, EEG to rule out
   non-convulsive status epilepticus (less likely)
   -Cycle cardiac enzymes
   2) Community Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia: Patient's daughter reported
   increased cough and respiratory distress at home and there does appear
   to be an infiltrate on chest radiograph.  Her oxygen requirement is
   worsened from baseline.    Last hospitalization was in [**5-/2202**] and the
   patient lives at home so no particularly high risks for respiratory
   pathogens.  Therefore, no clear need for extended coverage.  Patient
   received cefepime and levofloxacin in ED but will narrow to just
   levofloxacin unless signs of decompensation or reasons to suspect
   resistant organisms.
   -Levofloxacin 750 mg PO Q48hrs
   -Attempt to obtain sputum cultures if mental status resovles
   -Titrate oxygen to comfort and O2 sat between 92-94%
   3) Left sided weakness/hypertonicity: These deficits are concerning for
   a new embolic or ischemic stroke (hemorrhagic stroke essentially ruled
   out by CT w/o major deficits).  Patient has a history of Aflutter and
   not anticoagulated so always a threat of embolic event.  She could also
   have a large ischemic territory though a large event would likely show
   some changes on CT.  Other major possibility is that the patient is
   having epileptiform activity perhaps centered around an old area of
   ischemia or that she is simply recapitulating the deficits of her old
   stroke in the context of illness.
   -MRI when possible
   -EEG
   -ASA given possiblity of embolic stroke
   -Would ideally like blood pressure with systolics of 140-160 for brain
   perfusion but this is likely to be impossible to achieve given severe
   AS, will monitor blood pressures and attempt to prevent frank
   hypotension
   4) Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure/Severe AS: Patient currently
   appearing euvolemic.  Will hold home BP meds in context of allowing
   some autoregulation given possiblity of stroke but would be cautious if
   she becomes more hypertensive as this is likely to be poorly tolerated
   given AS.
   -Attempt to keep SBP's between 100-130 monitoring urine output and
   attempting to keep >130
   5) COPD: Patient appears to have emphysema by exam and radiograph and
   history of COPD.  Appears worsened in the context of probable pneumonia
   as oxygen requirement is increased.  ABG downstairs relatively benign,
   however, and patient's oxygen requirement has declined.
   -Continue ipratroprium and albuterol
   -recheck ABG later to make sure respiratory alkalosis is not worsening
   -treat pneumonia as above
   -not particularly wheezy now so will hold steroids for the moment (?
   COPD exacerbation) would consider if respiratory status continues to be
   major issue.
   6) Elevated troponin: Patient's ECG is not impressive for ACS and CK is
   normal suggesting no large territory infarct.  She was given aspirin
   downstairs but given threat of stroke that could convert to hemorrhagic
   would be cautious regarding systemic anticoagulation unless further
   evidence.  Also will hold BB given concern for low blood pressures and
   hypoperfusion of at risk area of CVA.
   -cycle enzymes, consider BB or systemic anticoagulation if rising CK's
   or hemodynamic instability
   -cardiology aware
   7) Borderline glucose intolerance: ISS w/ treatment for FSG >200.
   8) FEN: Very gentle IV fluids given history of AS and dCHF, NPO for now
   given mental status, recheck lytes this PM given Hypokalemia in ED
   (treated)
   9) PPx: Continue home PPI, SC heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diastolic heart failure, atrial flutter, severe aortic stenosis (AS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new multiple embolic infarcts. The patient's condition has been deteriorating with increased aortic insufficiency and right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to respiratory failure. There are also signs of pneumonia, and the patient's mental status is altered, likely due to encephalopathy caused by a recent stroke. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient may experience further deterioration in mental status due to ongoing encephalopathy or infection.
2. Increased Cough/O2 Requirement: The patient may develop worsening pneumonia or a COPD flare-up, which can lead to increased cough and oxygen requirement.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is deteriorating, with increased aortic insufficiency and RV hypokinesis. This may result in worsening heart failure symptoms or arrhythmias.
4. Elevated Lactate: The elevated lactate levels may indicate tissue hypoperfusion, potentially due to the increased work of breathing. Monitoring and supportive care are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

   1) Altered Mental Status: Likely encephalopathy in setting of recent
   stroke, may also have a contribution from infection. Improved from
   admission. Flat CKs suggest troponin elevation either from stroke or
   more remote cardiac event.
   - continue to provide supportive measures s/p stroke

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diastolic heart failure, atrial flutter, severe aortic stenosis (AS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent multiple embolic infarcts. The patient presented with respiratory failure, alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as well as multiple cerebral infarcts. Other findings include elevated lactate levels, borderline glucose intolerance, anemia, leukocytosis, and possible vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient is currently receiving supportive measures for stroke, treatment for pneumonia, cardiac medications, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient is already being treated for community-acquired pneumonia with antibiotics and bronchodilators. However, there is a potential for worsening of symptoms or development of antibiotic resistance.

2. Stroke: The patient has had multiple cerebral infarcts, which can lead to further neurological deficits or complications if there are additional embolic events.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has diastolic heart failure, severe AS, and elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac ischemia or infar"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diastolic heart failure, atrial flutter, severe aortic stenosis (AS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new multiple embolic infarcts. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, altered mental status, pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and congestive heart failure (CHF). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient continues to have an altered mental status, which is suspected to be delirium in the setting of systemic illness.
2. Increased Cough/O2 Requirement: The patient is being treated for CAP with azithromycin and ceftriaxone. She also receives a steroid course for COPD exacerbation.
3. CHF: The patient has diastolic heart failure, aortic stenosis, and hypokinetic left ventricle, leading to elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels despite a relatively normal chest X-ray.
4. Elevated Lactate: The patient has elevated lactate levels potentially due to increased work of breathing. Septic shock is unlikely as the patient is normotensive.
5. Potential DVT/PE: The patient has multiple risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), including immobility and severe AS.
6. Malnutrition: The patient has altered nutrition due to her critical illness and limited ability to consume food orally.
7. Glycemic Control: The patient may require close monitoring and management of blood glucose levels.
8. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient may require prophylaxis against stress ulcers due to her critical condition.
9. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given her prolonged mechanical ventilation.
10. Goals of Care: There needs to be further discussion with the patient's daughter regarding the goals of care, as the patient has a do-not-intubate (DNI) status."

   embolic infarcts, hypoxia, RV hypokinesis, tachypnea.
   .
   1) Altered Mental Status: Likely encephalopathy in setting of recent
   stroke, may also have a contribution from infection. Improved from
   admission. Flat CKs suggest troponin elevation either from stroke or
   more remote cardiac event.
   - continue to provide supportive measures s/p stroke  (maintaining BPs)
   - treat pneumonia as below
   2) Increased Cough/O2 Requirement: Possible pneumonia
   (community-aquired), vs COPD flare.
   - sputum cultures
   -CTX/Azithromycin to complete 7 day course
   -Continue ipratroprium and albuterol
   -methylprednisolone
   -Titrate oxygen to comfort and O2 sat between 92-94%
   -doesnt appear volume overloaded
   3) Cardiac: Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure/Severe AS/Elevated
   Troponin/Aflutter/HTN: Since last ECHO pt has deterioriating cardiac
   status with increased Aortic insufficiency and RV hypokinesis. ekg may
   have worrisome signs with pseudonormalization of T waves. Flat CKs
   suggest troponin elevation may be from remote cardiac event. ECHO
   suggest completed infarct. Concerned that pt stroke was from a
   showering of cardiac emboli.
   - hold lisinopril to let BP autoregulate (goal SBP 100-140) given may
   not tolerate higher pressure with her severe AS w/ AR.
   - on lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   - cont aspirin 81 mg daily
   - lopressor 5mg IV q6h
   .
   4)elevated lactate: [**Month (only) 60**] potentially be from increased work of
   breathing.  Is normotensive making septic shock unlikely.
   -continue antibiotics
   -oxygen supplementation
   3)multiple cerebral infarcts: lovenox 40mg [**Hospital1 **].  sourc of emboli has
   not been found.
   4) Borderline glucose intolerance: Likely more elevated in setting of
   acute stroke.
   -HISS w/ treatment for FSG >200.
   5) Anemia: microcytic with high RDW suggests mixed population. Given
   partial gastrectomy may have B12 deficiency which can affect mental
   status.
   - f/u iron studies, b12, folate
   6) Leukocytosis: neg Urine cx, benign abd exam, on CTX/azithro to
   complete Community Aquired PNA course. [**Month (only) 60**] also be reactive in setting
   of multiple acute strokes.
   - trend and culture pt (sputum, CXR, UA, stool for c. diff) if spikes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diastolic heart failure, atrial flutter, severe aortic stenosis (AS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new multiple embolic infarcts. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient likely has encephalopathy due to recent stroke and possible infection. Troponin elevation suggests cardiac involvement either from the stroke or a more remote cardiac event.

2. Increased Cough/O2 Requirement: Possible pneumonia or COPD flare. The patient requires treatment for community-acquired pneumonia and continues using ipratroprium and albuterol for COPD management.

3. Cardiac: Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure/Severe AS/Elevated Troponin/Aflutter/HTN: The patient's cardiac status has deteriorated with increased aortic insufficiency and right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis. There may be signs of pseudonormalization of T waves on EKG, indicating potential cardiac complications.

4. Elevated Lactate: Elevated lactate levels potentially due to increased work of breathing. However, the patient is normotensive, making septic shock unlikely.

5. Multiple Cerebral Infarcts: The source of emboli has not been identified, and the patient is receiving lovenox for prevention.

   81 year old female with multiple medical problems including diastolic
   heart failure, atrial flutter, severe AS, COPD, with new multiple
   embolic infarcts, hypoxia, RV hypokinesis, tachypnea.
   .
   1)  Hypoxia - Unclear why desaturated but could have developed some
   acute pulmonary edema secondary to her stenotic aortic valve in setting
   of mild hypertension/tachycardia. Responded to morphine,
   respositioning, and changing to high flow mask. CXR doesn't show any
   clear evidence for congestion, no significant infiltrates suggestive of
   a new, acute parencyhmal process.  An acute coronary event unlikely to
   have caused desat: although transient new T wave inversions seen on EKG
   as well as mild troponin elevation above baseline, likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in setting of her hypoxia and increased work of
   breathing rather than being the causative [**Doctor Last Name **].
   -Continue to wean from high flow mask as tolerated, maintaining O2 sats
   of 92 - 94%
   -continue treatment of possible underlying PNA with ceftriaxone and
   azithromycin to complete 7 day course (now on day 6)
   -day 2 of PO prednisone at 60 mg - continue for 2 more days then taper
   to 20 mg
   -nebs PRN
   -cycling enzymes: troponins steady at 0.83, .85.  Total CKs increased
   but CK-mB fractions not significant.  New T wave inversions in V1-V4
   but likely nonspecific and in setting of demand ischemia.  Cardiology
   aware; already on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] for recent ischemic stroke; doesn't
   require any other anticoagulation or change in management.
   .
   2) Altered Mental Status: Likely encephalopathy in setting of recent
   stroke, may also have a contribution from infection. Improved from
   admission.
   - continue to provide supportive measures s/p stroke  (maintaining BPs)

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diastolic heart failure, atrial flutter, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with new multiple embolic infarcts, hypoxia, right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis, and tachypnea. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient experienced desaturation, which responded to morphine, repositioning, and changing to a high-flow mask. This could be secondary to acute pulmonary edema due to her stenotic aortic valve in the setting of mild hypertension/tachycardia. 
2. Possible underlying pneumonia (PNA): The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for a possible community-acquired PNA, which she is now on day 6 of treatment.
3. Recent ischemic stroke: The patient had an ischemic stroke affecting the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), and anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Neurology feels the current deficits are secondary to a recrudescence of the prior stroke.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has deteriorating cardiac status with increased aortic insufficiency and RV hypokinesis, affecting her respiratory status. She also has chronic diastolic heart failure/severe AS with hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old female with multiple medical problems including diastolic
   heart failure, atrial flutter, severe AS, COPD, with new multiple
   embolic infarcts, hypoxia, RV hypokinesis, tachypnea.
   .
   1)  Hypoxia - Unclear why desaturated but could have developed some
   acute pulmonary edema secondary to her stenotic aortic valve in setting
   of mild hypertension/tachycardia. Responded to morphine,
   respositioning, and changing to high flow mask. CXR doesn't show any
   clear evidence for congestion, no significant infiltrates suggestive of
   a new, acute parencyhmal process.  An acute coronary event unlikely to
   have caused desat: although transient new T wave inversions seen on EKG
   as well as mild troponin elevation above baseline, likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in setting of her hypoxia and increased work of
   breathing rather than being the causative [**Doctor Last Name **].
   -Continue to wean from high flow mask as tolerated, maintaining O2 sats
   of 92 - 94%
   -continue treatment of possible underlying PNA with ceftriaxone and
   azithromycin to complete 7 day course (now on day 6)
   -day 2 of PO prednisone at 60 mg - continue for 2 more days then taper
   to 20 mg
   -nebs PRN
   -cycling enzymes: troponins steady at 0.83, .85.  Total CKs increased
   but CK-mB fractions not significant.  New T wave inversions in V1-V4
   but likely nonspecific and in setting of demand ischemia.  Cardiology
   aware; already on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] for recent ischemic stroke; doesn't
   require any other anticoagulation or change in management.
   .
   2) Altered Mental Status: Likely encephalopathy in setting of recent
   stroke, may also have a contribution from infection. Improved from
   admission.
   - continue to provide supportive measures s/p stroke  (maintaining BPs)
   - treat pneumonia as above
   .
   3) Cardiac: Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure/Severe AS//HTN: Since last
   ECHO pt has deterioriating cardiac status with increased Aortic
   insufficiency and RV hypokinesis.  Probably affecting respiratory
   status secondary to tenous aortic valve however no overt evidence of
   pulmonary edema.
   -holding lisinopril to let BP autoregulate (goal SBP 100-140) given may
   not tolerate higher pressure with her severe AS w/ AR.
   - lopressor 5mg IV q6h
   .
   4) Recent CVA - Secondary to ischemic stroke, bilateral, affecting PCA,
   MCA, ACA.  Neurology feels current deficits are secondary to
   recrudescence of prior stroke.  Does continue to have some mental
   status changes likely from encephalopathy from recent stroke.  Unclear
   whether embolic or thrombotic but embolic seems more likely given wide
   distribution affected.  Echo does not show any clot.
   -Obtain carotid duplex
   -Continue lovenox 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -continue aspirin 81 mg daily
   -Touch base with Neuro re: outpatient MRI; long-term anticoagulation.
   .
   5 Leukocytosis: Has slowly drifted up over last several days.  Neg
   Urine cx, blood cxs, CXR.  CTX/azithro to complete Community Aquired
   PNA course. Has not been febrile.  Likely secondary to prednisone
   course.
   .
   6) Borderline glucose intolerance: Likely more elevated in setting of
   acute stroke.
   -HISS w/ treatment for FSG >200.
   7) Anemia: microcytic with high RDW suggests mixed population. Given
   partial gastrectomy may have B12 deficiency which can affect mental

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypoxia: The patient experienced desaturation and required oxygen supplementation. This may be due to acute pulmonary edema secondary to her stenotic aortic valve, or it could be caused by an acute coronary event. The patient responded to morphine, repositioning, and changing to a high flow mask.

2. Possible pneumonia (PNA): The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for a possible community-acquired PNA. This suggests that the patient may have an underlying respiratory infection.

3. Demand ischemia: The patient has new T wave inversions on the EKG, as well as mild troponin elevation above baseline. These findings suggest possible myocardial ischemia due to increased cardiac workload, especially in the setting of hypoxia.

4. Altered mental status: The patient has signs of encephalopathy, likely secondary to a recent stroke. There may also be a contribution from infection.

5. Cardiac issues: The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure and severe aortic stenosis. Her cardiac status has deteriorated, with increased aortic insufficiency and right ventricular hypokinesis. This may be affecting her respiratory status.

6. Recent ischemic stroke: The patient had an ischemic stroke affecting the posterior circulation (PCA, MCA, ACA)."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diastolic heart failure, atrial flutter, severe aortic stenosis (AS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). She has been admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple embolic infarcts. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to hypoxemia and recent embolic cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs). She is on high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula and requires increased oxygenation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status continues to worsen, likely due to ongoing hypoxemia and the effects of recent embolic CVAs. Close monitoring and management of oxygenation levels are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Increased Cough/O2 Requirement: The patient is being treated for CAP with antibiotics (azithromycin and ceftriaxone). It is important to monitor her response to the antibiotics and ensure adequate treatment of the pneumonia.

3. CHF Management: The patient has diastolic dysfunction and severe AS, making CHF management challenging. Careful monitoring of fluid balance, cardiac function, and adjustments in medication dosages will be necessary to optimize her condition.

4. Decreased Urine Output: The patient's urine output is decreasing, and her creatinine levels are increasing. This"

   81 year old female with severe aortic stenosis, aflutter who is now s/p
   multiple bilateral embolic infarcts in MCA, ACA, PCA territories with
   mental status change and periodic hypoxia and tachypnea.
   .
   1)  Hypoxia - Patient desaturated two days ago into the mid 80s and
   responded to morphine, high flow mask, and respositioning.  Likely
   flash pulmonary edema, especially given severe AS.  Has tenuous
   hemodynamics and periodic desaturations may be her baseline. Over last
   24 hours has been weaned from high flow mask, now on nasal cannulus.
   Continuing tx of underlying PNA and possible COPD flare may help reduce
   degree of hypoxia.
   -Continue tx of underlying PNA with ceftriaxone and azithro (today is
   day final day of 7 day course)
   -Continue prednisone taper, currently getting 60 mg: tomorrow taper
   down to 20 mg
   -nebs PRN
   -Not a surgical candidate for AS; likely will continue to have periodic
   desaturations, key will be to keep blood pressure controlled and keep
   off fluid, however can't be aggressive w/ diuresis given that she's
   preload dependant.  Getting lopressor 5 mg IV q6 hrs.   BPs have been
   125 - 140.
   .
   2) Troponin elevation - Initially elevated secondary to CVA and have
   been stable at .75.  Following recent desat, enzymes further increased
   but have been stable at .85 with no significant change in CK-MB
   fraction.  Likely experienced some demand ischemia secondary to
   increased work of breathing.
   -Cardiology is aware
   -No change in management given she is already on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] for CVA
   .
   3) Altered Mental Status:  Change from baseline; unclear etiology.
   Likely encephalopathy in setting of recent stroke, may also have a
   contribution from infection as well as steroid course.  Unclear if
   improving.
   - continue to provide supportive measures s/p stroke  (maintaining BPs)
   - treat pneumonia as above
   - continue steroid taper
   .
   4) Recent CVA - Secondary to ischemic stroke, bilateral, affecting PCA,
   MCA, ACA.  Most likely embolic from cardiac origin given widespread,
   bilateral distribution and hx of aflutter.
   -Echo did not show any clot
   -Holding on carotid duplex as would not change management; not a
   surgical candidate
   -Continue lovenox 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -continue aspirin 81 mg daily
   -Touch base with Neuro re: outpatient MRI; long-term anticoagulation.
   .
   5 Leukocytosis: Stable at 16, likely secondary to prednisone course.
   -Follow after steroids are tapered
   .
   6) Borderline glucose intolerance: Likely more elevated in setting of
   acute stroke and prednisone course.
   -HISS w/ treatment for FSG >200.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis and atrial flutter who has experienced multiple bilateral embolic infarcts in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territories. She presents with mental status changes, periodic hypoxia, and tachypnea. The patient was treated for pneumonia and possible COPD flare with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. She is currently on a prednisone taper, nebs as needed, and metoprolol 5 mg IV q6 hours to control blood pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has periodic desaturations, which may be her baseline due to severe aortic stenosis and tenuous hemodynamics. This could potentially worsen if the underlying pneumonia and possible COPD flare are not adequately managed.
2. Troponin elevation: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, initially due to CVA and further increased following recent desaturation. This indicates ongoing myocardial ischemia or infarction, which may require additional interventions.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has changed from baseline, and the etiology is unclear. It is likely encephalopathy in the setting of recent stroke, with potential contributions from infection and steroid course. Monitoring and supportive measures should continue.

   increased work of breathing.
   -Cardiology is aware
   -No change in management given she is already on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] for CVA

   3) Altered Mental Status:  Change from baseline; unclear etiology.
   Likely encephalopathy in setting of recent stroke, may also have a
   contribution from infection as well as steroid course.  Unclear if
   improving.
   - continue to provide supportive measures s/p stroke  (maintaining BPs)
   - treat pneumonia as above
   - continue steroid taper
   .
   4) Recent CVA - Secondary to ischemic stroke, bilateral, affecting PCA,
   MCA, ACA.  Most likely embolic from cardiac origin given widespread,
   bilateral distribution and hx of aflutter.
   -Echo did not show any clot
   -Holding on carotid duplex as would not change management; not a
   surgical candidate
   -Continue lovenox 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, atrial flutter, who has suffered multiple bilateral embolic infarcts in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territories. The patient presents with mental status changes, periodic hypoxia, and tachypnea.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/58 mmHg to 138/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The creatinine level is within normal range, while the troponin-T level has been stable at 0.75. Other lab values, such as glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes, are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1) Hypoxia: The patient experienced desaturation two days ago, which responded to morphine, high flow mask, and repositioning. The patient is now on nasal cannula and will continue treatment for underlying pneumonia and possible COPD flare to reduce the degree of hypoxia.

2) Troponin elevation: The troponin elevation is secondary to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of respiratory failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient has a history of encephalopathy, allergies to codeine and ACE inhibitors, and anemia. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/64 mmHg to 138/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a 2L nasal cannula. The patient is moaning consistently but slightly more interactive. The physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, right lower extremity edema, and warm skin. Neurological examination shows attentive behavior, inability to follow simple commands, and no movement or tone assessment due to moaning. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated troponin-T levels. The patient has been receiving various medications including metoprolol and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient has a history of cardiac dysrhythmia, which could potentially lead to arrhythmias or heart block.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including diastolic heart failure, atrial flutter, severe aortic stenosis (AS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new multiple embolic infarcts. She presents with respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, altered mental status, and a history of cardiac dysrhythmia. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis, tachypnea, and decreased urine output. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to have an altered mental status that is not near her baseline, which may indicate a risk of complications related to confusion, disorientation, and impaired decision-making abilities.

2. Pulmonary Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and acute pneumonia, there is a potential risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atelectasis, or worsening hypoxia.

3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of diastolic heart failure, atrial flutter, and severe AS puts her at risk for cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or even cardiac arrest.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The presence of multiple embolic infarcts suggests an increased risk for developing DVT and PE due to prolonged imm"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old female with severe aortic stenosis, aflutter who is now s/p
   multiple bilateral embolic infarcts in MCA, ACA, PCA territories with
   mental status change and periodic hypoxia and tachypnea.
   .
   1)  Hypoxia - Patient desaturated two days ago into the mid 80s and
   responded to morphine, high flow mask, and respositioning.  Likely
   flash pulmonary edema, especially given severe AS.  Has tenuous
   hemodynamics and periodic desaturations may be her baseline. Over last
   24 hours has been weaned from high flow mask, now on nasal cannulus.
   Continuing tx of underlying PNA and possible COPD flare may help reduce
   degree of hypoxia.
   -Abx course complete, make sure D/C
   -Taper prednisone down to 20 mg
   -nebs PRN
   -Not a surgical candidate for AS; likely will continue to have periodic
   desaturations, key will be to keep blood pressure controlled and keep
   off fluid, however can't be aggressive w/ diuresis given that she's
   preload dependant.  Getting lopressor 5 mg IV q6 hrs.   BPs have been
   125 - 140.
   .
   2) Troponin elevation - Initially elevated secondary to CVA and have
   been stable at .75.  Following recent desat, enzymes further increased
   but have been stable at .85 with no significant change in CK-MB
   fraction.  Likely experienced some demand ischemia secondary to
   increased work of breathing.
   -Cardiology is aware
   -No change in management given she is already on lovenox [**Hospital1 **] for CVA
   .
   3) Altered Mental Status:  Change from baseline; unclear etiology.
   Likely encephalopathy in setting of recent stroke, may also have a
   contribution from infection as well as steroid course.  Unclear if
   improving.
   - continue to provide supportive measures s/p stroke  (maintaining BPs)
   - treat pneumonia as above
   - continue steroid taper
   .
   4) Recent CVA - Secondary to ischemic stroke, bilateral, affecting PCA,
   MCA, ACA.  Most likely embolic from cardiac origin given widespread,
   bilateral distribution and hx of aflutter.
   -Echo did not show any clot
   -Holding on carotid duplex as would not change management; not a
   surgical candidate
   -Continue lovenox 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -continue aspirin 81 mg daily
   -Touch base with Neuro re: outpatient MRI; long-term anticoagulation.
   .
   5 Leukocytosis: Stable at 13, likely secondary to prednisone course.
   -Follow after steroids are tapered
   .
   6) Borderline glucose intolerance: Likely more elevated in setting of
   acute stroke and prednisone course.
   -HISS w/ treatment for FSG >200.
   .
   7)FEN: replete lytes, NPO
   .
   8)Propohylaxis: pneumoboots, lovenox
   .
   9)code: DNR/DNI
   .
   10) Dispo - to floor pending above; discussed prognosis with daughter;
   she needs a little bit of time to think about goals of care; will
   communicate with her again today

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis and atrial flutter who has suffered multiple bilateral embolic infarcts in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territories. The patient is experiencing mental status changes, periodic hypoxia, and tachypnea. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), a heart rate of 71 bpm, a blood pressure range of 107-139/54-74 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 88% on a nasal cannula. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 134 mg/dL. 

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.7 K/uL, a slightly low hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, and a platelet count of 318 K/uL. The creatinine level is within normal range at 0.8 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating possible ischemia, but have been stable at 0.87. 

The patient's imaging shows bilateral embolic infarcts in the MCA, ACA, and PCA territories, consistent with multiple strokes. 

The patient's medical history includes severe aortic stenosis, atrial flutter, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with multiple medical problems including diastolic heart failure, atrial flutter, severe aortic stenosis (AS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and new multiple embolic infarcts. The patient presents with respiratory failure, acute alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, altered mental status, and bacterial pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 61-76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/54-139/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 98%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 46.5 kg, and height is 60 inches. Fluid balance shows an input of 519 mL and output of 920 mL, with a negative balance of 401 mL. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin, and slightly elevated potassium levels. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range. The assessment and plan include respiratory failure, alteration in nutrition, cardiac dysrhythmia, altered mental status, and bacterial pneumonia. The patient's mental status has improved today but is still not back to baseline. The primary driver of acute changes is congestive heart failure (CHF), which is difficult to manage due to severe AS and diastolic dysfunction. The patient's cough and oxygen"

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, alteration in nutrition, other cardiac dysrhythmia, altered mental status (not delirium), and bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure ranging from 107/54 to 139/67 mmHg, heart rate between 61-76 bpm, respiratory rate of 11-16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is on various medications including metoprolol and has received antibiotics such as azithromycin and ceftriaxone.

The physical examination reveals trace right lower extremity edema and 1+ left lower extremity edema. The patient's neurological status has improved today, but she remains not assessed for movement, tone, and mental status.

Lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count ranging from 14.3 to 17.9 K/uL, slightly decreased platelet count between 318 and 373 K/uL, and normal electrolyte levels. Other"
