","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly woman with severe aortic valve stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She presented to the hospital with intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and was admitted to the critical care unit for further management. The patient has a history of prolonged QT interval, and her INR is therapeutic due to being on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current medical conditions include severe aortic valve stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, anemia, bacteremia, potential seizure activity, urinary tract infection, and hyperlipidemia. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure of 145/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels including elevated potassium and low magnesium. Her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

Plan:

1. VT/Rhythm: The patient will continue to be monitored for recurrent runs of polymorphic VT. She is already receiving magnesium and lidocaine infusions. Holding mirtazapine, an antidepressant that can prolong the QT interval, has been considered.
2. AS: The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis with a valve area of 0.8-1.0 cm2. It is unclear whether her heart failure symptoms are fully attributable to AS. She will continue to optimize her heart failure regimen, and aortic valve replacement (AVR) has been planned for one month.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has a single bottle growing Gram-positive cocci. She has been given one dose of vancomycin, and further cultures are awaited. Possible sources of bacteremia include recent femur instrumentation or central lines.
4. Coronaries: No known history of coronary artery disease (CAD). She will continue simvastatin and ASA 81 mg daily. Metoprolol has been held due to bradycardia.
5. Pump: Echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >55%. The role of AS in her heart failure symptoms is unclear. She appears euvolemic and will continue her home dose of Lasix 40 mg daily, aiming for a negative fluid balance of -500 mL today.
6. Seizure activity: Unclear if the patient actually had seizure activity. She will continue seizure precautions, and her urine culture data will be monitored.
7. UTI: The patient's urine culture showed >100,000 gram-negative rods. She will continue ceftriaxone until sensitivities are available.
8. Anemia: Her hemoglobin concentration is trending down from the low 30s, which is her baseline. Active transfusion service and guaiac testing of stools will be continued.
9. HTN: The patient's blood pressure is currently well-controlled, and amlodipine has been held.
10. Hyperlipidemia: She will continue statin therapy as per her home regimen.
11. ORIF: The patient will likely need to return"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She presented to the hospital for evaluation of seizure-like activity and was found to have intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). She has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, therapeutic INR, and prolonged QT interval. The patient is currently admitted to the critical care unit for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Runs of VT/RHYTHM: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and intermittent NSVT. It is important to continue monitoring her rhythm and provide appropriate treatment if any arrhythmias occur.
2. AS (Aortic Stenosis): The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis with a valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. Further evaluation is needed to determine the role of AS in her heart failure symptoms. Optimization of heart failure regimen will be continued.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has a single bottle growing Gram-positive cocci (GPC) today. She was given one dose of vancomycin. It is important to consider possible sources of bacteremia, such as recent femur instrumentation or central lines. Final culture results are pending.
4. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient's urine culture showed >100,000 gram-negative rods. She is currently receiving ceftriax"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and hypertension. She was admitted to the CCU for further management of intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The patient also has a history of prolonged QT interval, but the reason for this is unknown. The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Severe AS: The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis with a valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2. This condition can lead to symptoms of heart failure and may require surgical intervention, such as aortic valve replacement (AVR).

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has AFib, which is associated with an increased risk of stroke and the need for anticoagulation therapy, such as coumadin.

3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is currently well-controlled.

4. Runs of VT/Rhythm: The patient experienced multiple runs of polymorphic VT in the ED, requiring magnesium and lidocaine infusions. She is now on telemetry monitoring and has had no recurrent runs since admission to the CCU. The patient's prolonged QT interval and torsades de pointes are of concern, and agents that may prolong QT are being avoided.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a pleasant, fatigued elderly woman in the ICU. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. Her recent events include receiving vitamin K for elevated INR, holding mirtazapine due to suspected ventricular tachycardia etiology, and being recommended for an aortic valve replacement (AVR) by the electrophysiology (EP) team. The patient also has a hip fracture for which she will be evaluated by a cardiac surgeon before proceeding with AVR. She is started on magnesium oxide and aldactone, and is planned for NPO status if she undergoes a procedure tomorrow. Additionally, her OSH records from Hospital1 have been requested, and a follow-up TTE has been scheduled in one month after recovery from her hip fracture.

The patient's echocardiogram results show moderately dilated right ventricular cavity with global hypokinesis, severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets with severe aortic stenosis, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. She also has severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension but no pericardial effusion.

Microscopic examination of blood cultures revealed the presence of GPC in pairs and clusters, leading to the administration of one dose of vancomycin. The patient has no known drug allergies and her last dose of antibiotics was ceftriax"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation (afib) on coumadin, and hypertension. She was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for further management after presenting from a rehabilitation facility for evaluation of seizure-like activity. 

The patient has a history of afib on coumadin, therapeutic INR, and known prolonged QT interval. She experienced multiple runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in the emergency department and required lidocaine drips. Since admission to the CCU, there have been no recurrent runs of VT/rhythm. 

The patient also has severe AS with a valve area of 0.8-1.0cm2, as shown on an echocardiogram (echo) yesterday. CT evaluation is planned when the patient is one month out from her hip surgery. 

In terms of coronary artery disease (CAD), the patient has no known history, but a cardiac echo was negative for any abnormalities. 

The patient's pump function is noted to be normal, with an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of over 55%. However, she does have severe pulmonary hypertension and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation (afib) on coumadin, and hypertension (HTN). The patient presented to the emergency department for evaluation of seizure-like activity and was found to have intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). She was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for further management.

The patient has a history of afib on coumadin with a therapeutic INR, and she also has a known prolonged QT interval, although the reason for it is unknown. There have been no recurrent runs of ventricular tachycardia since admission to the CCU.

The plan includes repletion of electrolytes aggressively with goals of magnesium >2.2 and potassium 4.5-5.0. Pads are already in place, and the patient is being monitored on telemetry. Agents that may prolong the QT interval should be avoided, and mirtazapine has been held due to case reports of mirtazapine-associated torsade de pointes.

Other assessments and plans include:
1. AS: Severe aortic valve stenosis with a valve area of 0.8-1.0 cm2, as seen on echocardiography yesterday. CT evaluation is planned when the patient is one month out from hip surgery.
2. CORONARIES: No"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly woman with a history of severe aortic valve stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and recent femur instrumentation. She was admitted to the CCU for evaluation of seizure-like activity and found to have intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. She also has a urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteremia, and anemia of chronic inflammation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/30-169/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. She has a junctional rhythm and is on heparin sodium prophylaxis.

Her physical examination reveals multiple ecchymoses on her upper extremities, dry and scaly skin on her hands, crackles bilaterally halfway up the lung fields, and good perfusion with 2+ radial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses. Neurological examination shows that she is alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 45200/μL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated lactate acid levels. Imaging shows"

- Her electrolytes need to be aggressively repleted with goals of magnesium >2.2 and potassium 4.5-5.0.
- She has pads in place, is on telemetry monitoring, and should avoid agents that may prolong QT. Mirtazapine has been held due to case reports of torsade de pointes.
- The patient's aortic valve stenosis is severe with a valve area of 0.8-1.0 cm2. The symptoms of heart failure are not fully attributed to AS yet. She will continue to optimize heart failure regimen.
- She has bacteremia with a single bottle growing gram-positive cocci (GPC) today. One dose of vancomycin was given, and the patient will continue on vancomycin until final culture results are available.

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and no history of coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the CCU for evaluation of seizure-like activity and intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. She has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is pansensitive except to nitrofurantoin. The patient's prolonged QT interval on ECG is unclear in etiology, and she is being closely monitored. She also has a basilar opacity on chest X-ray, which could represent aspiration or an infectious process. The patient's current medications include coumadin for atrial fibrillation, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, ceftriaxone for UTI, azithromycin for pneumonia, simvastatin, ASA, and Lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has had intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, indicating a potential risk for more severe arrhythmias. Monitoring on telemetry is recommended.
2. Prolonged QT Interval: The patient's prolonged QT interval on ECG is unclear in etiology. Avoiding agents that may prolong QT is advised.
3. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has a UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Continued treatment with cef"

","The patient is an elderly woman with multiple medical issues, including severe aortic valve stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation (afib) on coumadin, and hypertension (HTN). She presents with intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and is admitted to the CCU for further management.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient continues to have prolonged QT interval, but no further episodes of VT.
- The etiology of prolonged QT interval is unclear.
- The patient's recent urine culture showed Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone except for nitrofurantoin. A 6-16 day course of ceftriaxone is planned, and the foley catheter is no longer in place.
- The patient has fever, and the chest X-ray shows a small focal basilar opacity that may represent aspiration versus an infectious process. Azithromycin was started yesterday.
- There is a single bottle growing coag negative staphylococcus, most likely a contaminant. Vancomycin will be discontinued today.
- The patient has a history of severe AS, afib on coumadin, and HTN. She is scheduled for aortic valve replacement (AVR).
- The patient's baseline ejection fraction (EF) is >55%, and it is unclear what role AS is playing in her heart failure symptoms. She remains euvole"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly woman with severe aortic valve stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and no known drug allergies. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of seizure-like activity and intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient's prolonged QT interval is unclear in etiology. She has a urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone. The patient has also shown fever and a small focal basilar opacity on chest X-ray, possibly representing aspiration versus an infectious process. She has been started on azithromycin and will continue a 5-day course. Additionally, there is a single bottle growing coag-negative Staphylococcus, most likely a contaminant. The patient's baseline ejection fraction is over 55%. She has been placed on fluid restriction and will receive daily weights and strict input/output monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which can potentially progress to sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, leading to cardiac arrest.
2. Prolonged QT interval: The patient's prolonged QT interval may increase the risk of torsade de pointes, a life-threatening form of ventricular tachycardia.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She presents to the ICU for evaluation of seizure-like activity and intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. She has a history of prolonged QT interval, but the reason for this is unknown. The patient's current condition includes urinary tract infection (UTI), bradycardia, pain control, knowledge deficit, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and potential aspiration versus infectious process on chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/31 mmHg to 183/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Her blood glucose level is 95 mg/dL, white blood cell count is 10.0 K/uL, hemoglobin is 8.4 g/dL, and platelet count is 507 K/uL. Her electrolytes show sodium at 137 mEq/L, potassium at 3.9 mEq/L, magnesium at 25.3%, chloride at 99 mEq/L, and bicarbonate at 17 mg/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of prolonged QT, pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (except to nitrofurantoin), urinary tract infection, delirium, fever, and various cardiac dysrhythmias. The patient has been receiving antibiotics and is currently on ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and azithromycin. She has been experiencing fevers and has shown signs of infection with a small focal basilar opacity on chest X-ray, which may represent aspiration versus an infectious process. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/31 to 148/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. The patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin T levels are within normal limits. The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged PT and PTT with a normal INR. The patient's platelet count is low at 93 K/uL. The patient's neurologic examination reveals delirium, and her peripheral pulses are not assessed"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Prolonged QT: The patient has a history of prolonged QT, and the recent ECG showed continued prolonged QT. This can lead to torsades de pointes, a potentially life-threatening form of ventricular tachycardia.

2. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient experienced runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in the emergency department, which required the administration of magnesium and lidocaine. Although no recurrent runs have been observed since admission to the CCU, the patient remains at risk for further episodes of VT.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a significant colony count of Klebsiella pneumoniae in the urine culture, indicating a UTI. This may require adjustment in antibiotic therapy and potential intervention such as catheter removal.

4. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with GPC (Gram-positive cocci), and blood cultures from the same set are still pending. The source of bacteremia could be instrumentation or central lines, and further investigation is needed.

5. Severe Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis, as confirmed by echocardiography. This condition can lead to heart failure symptoms and requires further evaluation and management.

6. Anemia: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She presented to the hospital for evaluation of seizure-like activity and was found to have intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. She was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for further management.

Since admission, the patient has continued to have prolonged QT intervals on ECG. She was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone. The patient has been receiving a 6-16 day course of ceftriaxone. A foley catheter was removed, and she is now able to urinate.

The patient developed fever and a small focal basilar opacity on chest X-ray, which may represent aspiration versus an infectious process. She was started on azithromycin and will continue it pending the read of the chest X-ray.

A single bottle of blood culture grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which is most likely a contaminant. Vancomycin will be discontinued today.

The patient has no history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has no active issues related to her coronary arteries. She is euvolemic with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >55%. Her heart failure regimen will be optimized, and she will continue taking"

","The patient is a 79-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and hypertension. She presented from rehab for evaluation of seizure-like activity, found to have intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and admitted to the CCU for further management.

The patient's medical history includes a recent open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of a fracture and she will likely need to return to rehab after discharge. Her allergies include no known drug allergies. She has been evaluated by a cardiologist and a tentative plan for aortic valve replacement (AVR) has been made.

The patient's current medications include captopril, furosemide (Lasix), simvastatin, aspirin, and warfarin. She is also receiving ceftriaxone for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and azithromycin for a possible pneumonia, although her chest X-ray showed clear lungs. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 44 bpm, blood pressure of 132/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, sodium of 104 mg/dL, potassium of 0.8 mg/d"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and hypertension. She was admitted to the CCU for evaluation of seizure-like activity and intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, anemia of chronic inflammation, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient underwent a left heart catheterization which showed clean coronary arteries. An echocardiogram revealed severe aortic valve stenosis with a valve area of 0.8-1.0 cm2. The plan for aortic valve replacement (AVR) has been tentatively made after evaluation by a cardiologist.

The patient was also found to have a urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella, but it is currently negative after being treated with ceftriaxone for five days. The antibiotic will be discontinued, and the patient will be switched to Keflex 500 q6.

Other medical issues include anemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and possible seizure activity. The patient's baseline hematocrit level is around 30%, and she has received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). She is being monitored closely for any further episodes of seizure activity.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 44 bpm, blood"

She has been experiencing loose stool and has been sent for c. difficile testing. The patient is now on warfarin and received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) along with Lasix 20 IV once. No known drug allergies were reported.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), a heart rate of 44 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/31 to 181/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a junctional rhythm and weighs 60 kg. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,480 mL, including 378 mL by mouth, 330 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TF), and 1,150 mL of intravenous fluids (IVF). Output includes 285 mL of urine, 380 mL of NG (nasogastric) drainage, and -3 mL of balance.

Physical examination reveals multiple ecchymoses on the upper extremities, dry and scaly skin on the dorsal surface of both hands, regular rhythm with normal rate, and crackles in the bilateral lung fields.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and hypertension. She presented from rehabilitation for evaluation of seizure-like activity, found to have intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and admitted to the CCU for further management. The patient underwent a left heart catheterization which showed clean coronary arteries. Her repeat chest X-ray was clear, and she has been receiving various medications including captopril, furosemide (Lasix), warfarin, and simvastatin. She also received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Runs of VT/RHYTHM: The patient has experienced intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Monitoring on telemetry and avoiding agents that may prolong QT are recommended. Placement of defibrillator pads is also necessary.
2. AS (Aortic Stenosis): The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis with a valve area of 0.8-1.0 cm^2. She is planned for aortic valve replacement (AVR) after evaluation by cardiology.
3. UTI (Urinary Tract Infection): The patient initially tested positive for Klebsiella in her urine culture but is now negative after receiving ceftriaxone. She will be switched"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and hypertension. She presented to the hospital for evaluation of seizure-like activity, which was found to be intermittent runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). She was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for further management.

The patient has a history of heart failure, for which she is being optimized with medical management. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) that was initially positive for Klebsiella but became negative after completing a course of ceftriaxone. Her coronary arteries are clear, and she has stable anemia. She requires ongoing monitoring for potential complications such as seizure activity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pain management following an orthopedic surgery procedure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/39 to 188/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a heart rhythm of ventricular paced, and her fluid balance is within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood"

   Assessment and Plan
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU due to acute onset dyspnea and hypoxia secondary to congestive heart failure exacerbation. She has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. On admission, her vital signs were stable, but she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. She has been receiving fluids and diuretics as needed. A decision has been made to proceed with a vascular consult tomorrow to evaluate the need for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) before her scheduled valve surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as myocardial ischemia, infarction, or arrhythmias.
2. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's acute onset dyspnea and hypoxia indicate a possible pulmonary complication, which could progress to pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly in the ICU setting. This can manifest as catheter-related bloodstream infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
4. Bleeding: The patient's elevated INR and prolonged PTT suggest a potential bleeding risk, especially considering the anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium.
5. Renal Complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates possible renal dysfunction, which"
