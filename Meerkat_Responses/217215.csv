   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M with hx of asthma/COPD, Hep C and hx of substance abuse
   presents with worsening shortness of breath and COPD flare.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - secondary to his COPD flare.
   Likely his CO2 runs in high 40s, so is much higher.  His somnolence is
   worrisome.  Treatment of COPD exaccerbation as below.
   - restarting bipap
   - serial ABGs to follow CO2, will place a-line
   .
   # COPD exaccerbation - patient symptoms and recent end of prednisone
   taper are most consistent with COPD flare.  Patient became hypercarbic
   on NRB and stabalized on bipap.
   - wean bipap to face mask today
   - repeat ABG to reassess CO2
   - cont steroids solumedrol 125 mg q8hrs, insulin SC while on steroids
   - add azithro for COPD flare
   .
   # Somnolence - likely due to hypercarbia, could be secondary to other
   causes like etoh/drugs.
   - sending serum and urine tox screens
   - continue to correlate mental status with CO2, should improve as his
   respiratory status improves.
   .
   # Chest pain - nonspecific symptoms, unlikely ACS as EKG unchanged and
   first set of cardiac enzymes were negative.
   - cycle enzymes
   - probably is muscloskeletal chest pain
   .
   # Headache - likely secondary to his respiratory distress, can try
   tylenol for pain control, appears comfortable without any neurolgical
   symptoms or findings on exam.
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Hep C - stable, NTD
   .
   # Anxiety - continue home medicines once mental status has improved.
   .
   # Hx of substance abuse - tox screens as above
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse. He presented with worsening shortness of breath and a COPD flare. He is currently admitted to the ICU for management of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening shortness of breath and somnolence are consistent with hypercarbic respiratory failure due to his COPD flare. This condition can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's symptoms and recent discontinuation of prednisone taper are indicative of a COPD exacerbation. If left untreated, this can lead to further deterioration in lung function and increased risk of complications.
3. Somnolence: The patient's somnolence may be secondary to hypercarbia, but other causes such as alcohol or drug use should also be considered. Monitoring and treatment of CO2 levels are essential to improve mental status.
4. Chest Pain: The patient's nonspecific chest pain is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome given the negative initial cardiac enzymes and unchanged EKG. However, it should still be monitored, and further evaluation may be required.
5. Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of Hepatitis C, which is currently stable. Regular monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent complications associated with this chronic infection.
6. Substance Abuse: Given the patient's history of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been on biPAP for most of the day with slight improvement in respiratory symptoms, including wheezing. Steroids, antibiotics, and nebulizers have been administered. The patient also has a history of chest pain. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 145/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 31%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 53 mmHg, PaO2 of 68 mmHg, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 243. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.1 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) of 39.7%, normal platelet count (Plt) of 182 K/uL, and elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is below 0.01, and the lactic acid level is 1.8 mmol/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient has a history of chest pain and respiratory failure, and the current assessment is consistent with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure exacerbation: The patient's respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, and the need for biPAP and CPAP/PSV ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory distress. There is a potential risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to respiratory failure exacerbation.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and the administration of antibiotics suggest a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the antibiotic therapy accordingly is important.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of chest pain raises concerns about potential cardiac complications. Continuous monitoring of the patient's heart rhythm and cardiac enzymes is essential to detect any abnormalities.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine level indicates a possible impairment in renal function. Close monitoring of the patient's urine output and electrolyte levels is necessary to assess and manage any potential AKI.
5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing VTE. Prophylactic measures"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse. He presented with worsening shortness of breath and a COPD flare. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, COPD exacerbation, right middle lobe/left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, somnolence, chest pain, headache, anxiety, and a history of substance abuse. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty in eliminating carbon dioxide from his body due to impaired lung function. If left untreated, this can lead to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, resulting in respiratory acidosis and potential complications such as confusion, nausea, vomiting, and even cardiac arrest.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD is currently worsening, which increases the risk of further respiratory complications. This can include increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, and potentially life-threatening respiratory distress.
3. Infiltrate on Chest X-ray: The presence of infiltrates in the right middle lobe and left lower lobe may indicate pneumonia or another pulmonary infection. If not treated appropriately, this can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.
4. Somnolence: The patient's mental status is currently impaired, which could be due to hypercarbia or other causes. If not addressed, it can progress to altered mental"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse. He presents with worsening shortness of breath and a COPD flare. The patient's current condition indicates hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to his COPD flare. He is currently being treated for his COPD exacerbation, somnolence, chest pain, headache, Hepatitis C, anxiety, and history of substance abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening shortness of breath and high CO2 levels suggest hypercarbic respiratory failure due to his COPD flare. This condition can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, resulting in respiratory acidosis and potential complications such as confusion, lethargy, and even coma if not promptly addressed.

2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's symptoms and recent end of prednisone taper are consistent with a COPD flare. If not managed appropriately, this exacerbation may lead to further worsening of the patient's respiratory status and potential respiratory arrest.

3. Somnolence: The patient's mental status is likely due to hypercarbia, but other causes like etoh/drugs should also be considered. If left untreated, somnolence could progress to a deeper level of consciousness impairment, leading to increased risk of falls, aspiration, and other complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M with hx of asthma/COPD, Hep C and hx of substance abuse
   presents with worsening shortness of breath and COPD flare.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - secondary to his COPD flare.
   Likely his CO2 runs in high 40s, so is much higher.  His somnolence is
   worrisome.  Treatment of COPD exaccerbation as below.
   - restarting bipap
   - serial ABGs to follow CO2, will place a-line
   .
   # COPD exaccerbation - patient symptoms and recent end of prednisone
   taper are most consistent with COPD flare.  Patient became hypercarbic
   on NRB and stabalized on bipap.
   - wean bipap to face mask today
   - repeat ABG to reassess CO2
   - cont steroids solumedrol 125 mg q8hrs, insulin SC while on steroids
   - add azithro for COPD flare
   .
   # Somnolence - likely due to hypercarbia, could be secondary to other
   causes like etoh/drugs.
   - sending serum and urine tox screens
   - continue to correlate mental status with CO2, should improve as his
   respiratory status improves.
   .
   # Chest pain - nonspecific symptoms, unlikely ACS as EKG unchanged and
   first set of cardiac enzymes were negative.
   - cycle enzymes
   - probably is muscloskeletal chest pain
   .
   # Headache - likely secondary to his respiratory distress, can try
   tylenol for pain control, appears comfortable without any neurolgical
   symptoms or findings on exam.
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Hep C - stable, NTD
   .
   # Anxiety - continue home medicines once mental status has improved.
   .
   # Hx of substance abuse - tox screens as above
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse. He presented with worsening shortness of breath and a COPD flare. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to his COPD flare, somnolence, chest pain, headache, anxiety, and a history of substance abuse. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening shortness of breath and high CO2 levels indicate hypercarbic respiratory failure. This is likely due to his COPD flare-up and requires immediate treatment.
2. Somnolence: The patient is experiencing altered mental status or somnolence, which could be caused by hypercarbia or other factors such as substance abuse. Further evaluation is needed, including serum and urine tox screens.
3. Chest Pain: The patient is experiencing nonspecific chest pain, which is unlikely to be acute coronary syndrome (ACS) given the negative cardiac enzymes and unchanged EKG. It may be musculoskeletal pain, but further assessment is required.
4. Headache: The patient's headache is likely secondary to his respiratory distress. Tylenol can be used for pain control, but neurological symptoms or findings should be closely monitored.
5. Hepatitis C: The patient's Hepatitis C is currently stable.
6. History of Substance Abuse: The patient has a history of substance abuse, and tox screens"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse. He was admitted on 6-20 with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. The patient has shown improvement but still remains off baseline. He has been diagnosed with COPD exacerbation and probable obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea (OSA/OHV). The patient also has anxiety and is on home medications for it. His current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 140/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a venti mask with CPAP/PSV mode set at 10 cmH2O, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 28%, and SpO2 at 92%. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, PERRL, normocephalic head, cardiovascular system with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, markedly decreased air movement in the respiratory/chest area, soft and non-tender abdomen, and unassessed skin and neurologic examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of COPD and acute hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a high risk for respiratory complications such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse. He was admitted on 6/20 with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. The patient's current condition is stable, but he still has not returned to baseline. He is receiving treatment for COPD exacerbation, probable OSA/OHV, anxiety, and other conditions as per the housestaff note. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly low oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 92%. His blood glucose levels are well-controlled with regular insulin sliding scale. He is receiving IV fluids and has an arterial line for monitoring. The patient is on prophylactic UF heparin for DVT and has a stress ulcer prophylaxis. His code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of asthma/COPD and is currently experiencing an exacerbation of obstructive lung disease, which can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The presence of an arterial line and potential exposure to hospital-acquired pathogens may increase the risk of infection, especially since the patient has Hepatitis C.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Long-term immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots, such as"

   I was present with MICU housestaff team for the key portions of
   services provided and agree with the history, physical, assessment and
   plan as outlined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5199**] above. I would add the following:
   48 yo male with Hep C, hx of polysubstance abuse and COPD admitted
   yesterday with severe COPD exacerbation and severe hypercarbic failure.
   He has been on intermittent NIPPV. Physical exam today reveals slight
   improvement in aeration, though air movement still quite tight. pCO2
   slightly reduced on blood gases. He overall is improved, but remains
   critically ill. Will continue nebs, IV steroids, NIPPV. Drug screen was
   negative (aside from benzodiazepines which is part of his home
   regimen). Degree of emphysema seen on chest CT may reflect prior
   cocaine and heroin use, but it remains unclear why he
s having
   recurrent COPD exacerbations.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse. He was admitted on [**6-20**] with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. The patient's current condition shows improvement in aeration but still has tight air movement. His pCO2 levels are slightly reduced. He remains critically ill and will continue with nebs, IV steroids, and NIPPV. The patient's drug screen was negative except for benzodiazepines, which are part of his home regimen. The degree of emphysema seen on chest CT may be related to prior cocaine and heroin use, but it is unclear why he is experiencing recurrent COPD exacerbations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged or severe hypercarbic respiratory failure leading to respiratory arrest.
2. Development of respiratory infections due to impaired lung function.
3. Increased risk of cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction due to COPD exacerbation.
4. Possible worsening of liver function due to Hepatitis C infection.
5. Recurrence of COPD exacerbations and potential progression of the disease.
6. Complications related to long-term use of BiPAP, such as skin breakdown or eye problems.
7. Potential development of anxiety or depression due to the chronic nature of the disease and hospitalization.
8. Risk of blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M with hx of asthma/COPD, Hep C and hx of substance abuse
   presents with worsening shortness of breath and COPD flare.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - secondary to his COPD flare.
   Likely his CO2 runs in high 40s.  Treatment of COPD exaccerbation as
   below.  Mental status much improved.
   - tolerated bipap throughout night yesterday, switched to venti mask
   last evening
   - CO2s in 50s, which is improved over yesterday
   - conitinue serial ABGs to follow CO2
   - will try bipap at night with autotitration
   .
   # COPD exaccerbation - patient symptoms and recent end of prednisone
   taper are most consistent with COPD flare.
   - repeat ABG to reassess CO2
   - cont steroids solumedrol 125 mg q8hrs, insulin SC while on steroids
   - add azithro for COPD flare
   .
   # RML/LLL infiltrate on CXR
 patient not coughing, WBC stable, no
   fevers.  On azithro for COPD flare; if spikes or clinically worsens
   would broaden to levofloxacin or add ceftriaxone.
   .
   # Somnolence - likely due to hypercarbia, could be secondary to other
   causes like etoh/drugs, but tox screens negative and patient
s mental
   status is improving as respiratory status improving..
   - continue to correlate mental status with CO2, should improve as his
   respiratory status improves.
   .
   # Chest pain - nonspecific symptoms, unlikely ACS as EKG unchanged and
   Ces neg x2.
   - continue tylenol for musculoskeletal chest pain, could potentially be
   related to PNA.
   .
   # Headache - likely secondary to his respiratory distress, can try
   tylenol for pain control, appears comfortable without any neurolgical
   symptoms or findings on exam.
   - tylenol PRN
   .
   # Hep C
 stable
   .
   # Anxiety - continue home medicines once mental status has improved.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hep C, and substance abuse. He presents with worsening shortness of breath and a COPD flare. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to his COPD flare. His mental status has improved, and he is tolerating bipap throughout the night. The plan is to continue serial ABGs to follow CO2 levels and try bipap at night with autotitration.

The patient also has a COPD exacerbation with symptoms consistent with a COPD flare. Repeat ABG is planned to reassess CO2 levels. Steroids (solumedrol 125 mg q8hrs) and insulin SC while on steroids will be continued. Azithromycin has been started for the COPD flare. If there are spikes or clinical worsening, levofloxacin or ceftriaxone may be added.

The patient has an RML/LLL infiltrate on CXR, but is not coughing. WBC stable, no fevers. The patient is already on azithro for the COPD flare, and if symptoms worsen, levofloxacin or ceftriaxone may be considered.

Somnolence is likely due to hypercarbia, but other causes like etoh/drugs are also considered. Tox screens are negative, and mental status is improving as respiratory status improves."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hep C, and substance abuse. The patient presents with worsening shortness of breath and a COPD flare. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has high CO2 levels due to his worsening COPD flare, which can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's symptoms and recent end of prednisone taper are consistent with a COPD flare. If not treated appropriately, this can worsen the patient's respiratory status and lead to further complications.

3. Right Middle Lobe/Left Lower Lobe Infiltrate on CXR: The presence of infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggests a possible pneumonia. If not treated appropriately, it can lead to worsening of the patient's condition.

4. Somnolence: The patient's somnolence is likely due to hypercarbia, but other causes like alcohol or drug use should be considered. If left untreated, it can affect the patient's mental status.

5. Chest Pain: The patient's nonspecific chest pain may be related to pneumonia or musculoskeletal issues. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

6. Headache: The patient's headache is likely secondary to respiratory distress. Proper management of the underlying respiratory issues should help alleviate the headache."

   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M with hx of asthma/COPD, Hep C and hx of substance abuse
   presents with worsening shortness of breath and COPD flare.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - secondary to his COPD flare and
   OSA.  Treatment of COPD exaccerbation as below.  Mental status much
   improved.  His high CO2 this morning was likely contributable to his
   OSA more than a worsening COPD exaccerbation. Bipap overnight was used
   but not titrated up aggressively enough.
   - will pursue either more aggressive bipap titration overnight or a
   true sleep study and monitor CO2
   - CO2s in 60s again, likely from OSA last night
   - conitinue serial ABGs to follow CO2
   - will try bipap at night with autotitration
   .
   # COPD exaccerbation - patient symptoms and recent end of prednisone
   taper are most consistent with COPD flare.
   - improved aeration in lungs today
   - cont steroids solumedrol 125 mg q8hrs, insulin SC while on steroids
   has received 2 days of steroids, will try 3 days total for IV steroids
   and then consider transition to PO
   - cont azithro for COPD flare
   .
   # RML/LLL infiltrate on CXR
 no new CXR, no clinical changes today;
   patient not coughing, WBC stable, no fevers.  On azithro for COPD
   flare; if spikes or clinically worsens would broaden to levofloxacin or
   add ceftriaxone.
   .
   # Somnolence
 improving, likely was from hypercarbia, as tox screens
   neg; continues to have morning somnulence that improves as the day
   progresses.
   .
   # Chest pain - nonspecific symptoms, unlikely ACS as EKG unchanged and
   Ces neg x2.
   - continue tylenol for musculoskeletal chest pain, could potentially be

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse. He presents with worsening shortness of breath and a COPD flare. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are as follows:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's high CO2 levels indicate hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is secondary to his COPD flare and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This condition can lead to respiratory acidosis and may require aggressive titration of BiPAP or a true sleep study to monitor CO2 levels.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's symptoms and recent discontinuation of prednisone suggest a COPD exacerbation. This condition can worsen over time and may lead to respiratory failure if not treated promptly. The patient is being continued on steroids and azithromycin for the COPD flare.
3. RML/LLL Infiltrate on CXR: The presence of an infiltrate on the chest X-ray indicates a possible pneumonia. If the patient's condition worsens or if the infiltrate progresses, it may require broadening the antibiotic coverage, such as adding levofloxacin or ceftriaxone.
4. Somnolence: The patient has shown signs of somnolence, likely due to hypercarbia. As his CO2 levels normalize, his mental"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M with hx of asthma/COPD, Hep C and hx of substance abuse
   presents with worsening shortness of breath and COPD flare.
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - secondary to his COPD flare and
   OSA.  Treatment of COPD exaccerbation as below.  Mental status much
   improved.  His high CO2 this morning was likely contributable to his
   OSA more than a worsening COPD exaccerbation. Bipap overnight was used
   but not titrated up aggressively enough.
   - will pursue either more aggressive bipap titration overnight or a
   true sleep study and monitor CO2
   - CO2s in 60s again, likely from OSA last night
   - conitinue serial ABGs to follow CO2
   - will try bipap at night with autotitration
   .
   # COPD exaccerbation - patient symptoms and recent end of prednisone
   taper are most consistent with COPD flare.
   - improved aeration in lungs today
   - cont steroids solumedrol 125 mg q8hrs, insulin SC while on steroids
   has received 2 days of steroids, will try 3 days total for IV steroids
   and then consider transition to PO
   - cont azithro for COPD flare
   .
   # RML/LLL infiltrate on CXR
 no new CXR, no clinical changes today;
   patient not coughing, WBC stable, no fevers.  On azithro for COPD
   flare; if spikes or clinically worsens would broaden to levofloxacin or
   add ceftriaxone.
   .
   # Somnolence
 improving, likely was from hypercarbia, as tox screens
   neg; continues to have morning somnulence that improves as the day
   progresses.
   .
   # Chest pain - nonspecific symptoms, unlikely ACS as EKG unchanged and
   Ces neg x2.
   - continue tylenol for musculoskeletal chest pain, could potentially be
   related to PNA.
   .
   # Headache - likely secondary to his respiratory distress, can try
   tylenol for pain control, appears comfortable without any neurolgical
   symptoms or findings on exam.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hep C, and substance abuse. He presents with worsening shortness of breath and a COPD flare. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation using a BiPAP mask during the day and a venti mask at night. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/70 to 157/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 60 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 270. 

The physical examination reveals crackles at the bases and wheezes throughout the chest, indicating possible pulmonary edema and obstructive airway disease. The patient's neurologic examination is normal, and his labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's assessment includes hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to COPD flare and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The treatment plan involves aggressive titration of BiPAP overnight, consideration of a sleep study, continuation of steroids and azithromycin for COPD flare, and monitoring of CO2 levels.

   I was physically present with the resident team on this date for
   discussion of the above history, exam and assessment and plan with
   which I agree.  I independently examined the patient and would add the
   following comments: Admitted with acute hypercarbic failure from COPD
   exacerbation. Placed on BiPAP (PS 12/PEEP 5) last night, but still
   hypercarbic this morning, then improved during the afternoon. . Pt
   breathing is subjectively improved. Of note, he does link worsening of
   respiratory sx
s to a change in his home environment 2 months ago,
   noting increased levels of mold where he now resides for his treatment
   program.
   Physical exam reveals better aeration, though air movement still only
   fair.
   For his hypercarbic failure and COPD exacerbation, pt to continue on
   steroids, azithromycin, NIPPV. His body habitus would not suggest OHV
   though with his snoring and COPD there could be OSA +alveolar
   hypoventilation. Worsening hypercarbia overnight hard to interpret due
   to apparent poor mask fit. Plan to optimize mask fit tonight (nasal
   mask + biPAP machine if needed.) Will first adjust PS based on blood
   gases but if at PS ~15 and still hypercarbic, I would then increase
   PEEP.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 35 minutes.

   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure - secondary to his COPD flare and
   OSA.  Treatment of COPD exaccerbation as below.  Mental status much
   improved.  His high CO2 this morning was likely contributable to his
   OSA more than a worsening COPD exaccerbation. Bipap overnight was used
   o/n an gas much improved this am.
   - will pursue either more aggressive bipap titration overnight or a
   true sleep study and monitor CO2
   - CO2s in 50 this am with much decreased somnolence
   - conitinue serial ABGs to follow CO2
   - continue tx for COPD with azithro/steroids/nebs
   -transition to PO steroids today.
   -Bipap with settings 16/8 on 2L at night.
   .
   # COPD exaccerbation - patient symptoms and recent end of prednisone
   taper are most consistent with COPD flare.
   - 3 days of IV steroids, now transition to PO today.
   - cont azithro for COPD flare
   -nebs/bypap as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse. He presented with worsening shortness of breath and a COPD flare. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chest pain, hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to his COPD flare and OSA, and an RML/LLL infiltrate on CXR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure due to his COPD flare and OSA. Aggressive treatment is necessary to manage his respiratory status.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's symptoms and recent end of prednisone taper are consistent with a COPD flare. He requires continued treatment for COPD exacerbation with azithromycin, steroids, nebs (nebulizers), and bipap (bi-level positive airway pressure) at night.
3. OSA: The patient's high CO2 levels in the morning were likely due to OSA. Further evaluation with a sleep study is needed to confirm the diagnosis, and treatment with bipap overnight may be necessary.
4. Chest Pain: The patient has a history of chest pain. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and provide appropriate treatment.

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse. He presents with worsening shortness of breath and a COPD flare. The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and respiratory failure.

Assessment:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - secondary to his COPD flare and OSA.
2. COPD exacerbation - patient symptoms and recent end of prednisone taper are most consistent with COPD flare.
3. Right middle lobe (RML)/left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate on chest X-ray.
4. Somnolence - improving, likely due to hypercarbia.
5. Chest pain - nonspecific symptoms, unlikely acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
6. Headache - likely secondary to respiratory distress.
7. Hepatitis C - stable.
8. Anxiety - continue home medicines, anxiety symptoms stable.
9. History of substance abuse - negative toxicology screens, continue nicotine patch.

Plan:
1. Treatment of COPD exacerbation:
   - Continue solumedrol 125 mg q8hrs.
   - Try bipap at night with autotitration.
   - Monitor CO2 levels.
   - Consider transition to oral steroids after completing IV steroids.
   - Continue azithromycin for COPD flare.
2. RML/LLL infiltrate:
   - No new chest X-ray"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse admitted on 6-20 with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments, including BiPAP, solumedrol, azithromycin, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in blood pressure. The patient's respiratory support is being titrated, and they are tolerating low-flow oxygen well. The patient's mental status is being trended, and there is persistent hypercarbia. The plan includes transitioning to PO prednisone, insulin while on steroids, and a pulmonary consult for continued follow-up on the floor. The patient also has probable OSA/OHV, for which BiPAP settings need to be continued on the floor, and a sleep study is needed upon discharge. The patient has a history of multiple recurrent COPD exacerbations, possibly related to home or environmental exposures. There are no clinical signs of pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and hypercarbic respiratory failure indicate a risk for further deterioration in lung function.
2. Infection: Although there are no clinical signs of pneumonia, the patient is on antibiotics (azithromycin), suggesting a concern for potential infections.
3. Steroid-induced complications: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient presented with chest pain and respiratory failure, but not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been receiving various medications, including azithromycin, heparin sodium, and lorazepam.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate between 66-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118-177 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and shows good oxygenation with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 333.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Kidney function is within normal range, but liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of COPD and acute exacerbation, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening respiratory failure.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypertension, and the use of heparin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of asthma/COPD, Hepatitis C, and substance abuse. He was admitted on 6-20 with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of obstructive lung disease. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, COPD exacerbation, probable OSA/OHV, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and the current exacerbation put him at risk for worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring of vital signs, especially oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, is crucial.
2. Infection: Although there are no clinical signs of pneumonia, the patient received azithromycin, which suggests a concern for possible respiratory tract infection. Monitoring for fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening chest x-ray findings is important.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has had a significant fluid balance over the past day, with a net loss of 1655 mL. This could indicate dehydration or ongoing fluid losses. Monitoring daily weights, intake/output fluids, and electrolyte levels is essential.
4. Hepatitis C: The patient's history of Hepatitis C should be considered, especially when evaluating liver function tests and considering medication options.
5. Substance abuse history: The patient's history of substance abuse may impact his recovery and management. Assessing and addressing any potential withdrawal symptoms or relapse risk is important.
