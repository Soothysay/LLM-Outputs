","Summary:
The patient is a 28-inch tall individual with an undetermined age or gender, admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, aspiration, hypoxemia, fever, and anemia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen through a high-flow nasal cannula. They have a central line and arterial line in place. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/65 to 93/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 62 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase at 578 IU/L. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already diagnosed with pneumonia and is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, potentially leading to a pulmonary embolism if"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3972**] is a 49yo female with no significant PMH who presents with
   increasing oxygen requirement and cxray findings consistent with
   multifocal PNA.
   .
   #) Legionella Multilobar pneumonia: Chest X-ray appears worse with
   diffuse bilateral infiltrated at the bases, respiratory status
   continues to be very tenuous.
   -- Continue Levaquin, Azithromycin IV for now given lack of clinical
   response, although double coverage may not be necessary later
   -- Appreciate ID team following
   -- F/U pending serologies: HIV, EBV, CMV, Leptospira, RMSF, Parvovirus,
   Lyme, Erlichia
   -- Atrovent nebs / Albuterol nebs schedules
   -- Low threshold for intubation, appears patient is progressing to
   ARDS.
   -- If Decreased mental status, hypercarbia > 70 refractory to bipap
   trial or overall deterioration, will need intubation.
   -- Hi flow O2 supplementation
   .
   #. Mixed Acid Base Disorder: Ongoing respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic alkalosis.
   A) Metabolic Alkalosis:
   -- Control nausea to avoid emesis and acid loss
   -- Scheduled Zofran, NPO for now
   -- Replete Potassium with KCl as pt has metabolic hypochloremic
   acidosis
   -- NS for maintenance fluids to replete chloride and reverse component
   of contraction alkalosis
   B) Respiratory Acidosis:
   -- Hi Flow oxygen to reduce tachypnea
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct with rapid change, suspect spurrious result
   -- Repeat today
   -- Transfuse for Hct < 25
   .
   #)Arthralgias/rash: Patient initially had arthralgias and rash, all of
   which have resolved at this time. She may initially have had a viral
   illness and now have a superimposed bacterial infection given her
   pneumonia.
   -- Monitor daily for symptoms
   .
   #)Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Legionella
   -- Continue to trend daily LFTs
   -- f/u EBV, CMV,
   -- HIV negative
   #)Depression: Continue Celexa 20mg PO daily.
   #)FEN: NPO for now
   #)Prophylaxis: Enoxaparin prophylaxis, PPI not needed
   #)Access: PIV, a line
   #)Dispo: Pending clinical improvement

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presents with increasing oxygen requirement and chest X-ray findings consistent with multifocal pneumonia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Legionella Multilobar pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings indicate a severe form of pneumonia caused by the Legionella bacteria. This can lead to respiratory failure and require intensive care support.

2. Mixed Acid Base Disorder: The patient has ongoing respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. This means there is an imbalance in the body's acid-base levels, which can affect various organ functions.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. If this is confirmed, the patient may require blood transfusion.

4. Arthralgias/rash: The patient initially had joint pain and rash, which have resolved. However, it is important to monitor for any recurrence of these symptoms.

5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to the Legionella infection. It is important to trend the liver function tests and rule out other causes of liver injury.

6. Depression: The patient is currently being treated for depression with Celexa. It is important to continue monitoring and managing this condition.

7. Nutritional support: The patient's nutritional status should be assessed and appropriate measures should be taken to ensure adequate nutrition, especially considering the current ICU stay"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions and assessments. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/62 to 169/138 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 62 mmHg, PaO2 of 242 mmHg, and HCO3- of 121 mEq/L. These values suggest respiratory acidosis with compensation.

The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) multiple times due to worsening ABG values. An arterial line was placed on the right radial artery. The patient experienced an anxiety episode at night and was given 0.5 mg of Ativan IV.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 366 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 9.0 g/dL, normal glucose level of 94 mg/dL, low magnesium level of 0.2 mg/dL, and normal potassium levels. Other lab values such as creatinine,"

   #) Legionella Multilobar pneumonia: Chest X-ray appears worse with
   diffuse bilateral infiltrated at the bases, respiratory status
   continues to be very tenuous.
   -- Continue Levaquin, adjust dose to 500mg from 750mg given long
   anticipated treatment. Continue Azithromycin IV for now given lack of
   clinical response, although double coverage may not be necessary later
   -- Appreciate ID team following
   -- F/U pending serologies: HIV, EBV, CMV, Leptospira, RMSF, Parvovirus,
   Lyme, Erlichia
   -- Atrovent nebs / Albuterol nebs schedules
   -- Low threshold for intubation, appears patient is progressing to
   ARDS.
   -- If Decreased mental status, hypoxia or hypercarbia > 70 refractory
   to bipap trial or overall deterioration, will need intubation.
   -- Hi flow O2 supplementation
   .
   #. Mixed Acid Base Disorder: Ongoing respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic alkalosis.
   A) Metabolic Alkalosis:
   -- Control nausea to avoid emesis and acid loss
   -- Discontinue Percocet as this is likely causing nausea
   -- Avoid phenergan as this appears to worsen mental status
   significantly
   -- Scheduled Zofran, NPO for now
   -- Replete Potassium with KCl as pt has metabolic hypochloremic
   acidosis
   -- NS for maintenance fluids to replete chloride and reverse component
   of contraction alkalosis
   B) Respiratory Acidosis:
   -- Hi Flow oxygen to reduce tachypnea
   #. Anemia: Stable
   -- Transfuse for Hct < 25
   #)Arthralgias/rash: Patient initially had arthralgias and rash, all of
   which have resolved at this time. She may initially have had a viral
   illness and now have a superimposed bacterial infection given her
   pneumonia.
   -- Monitor daily for symptoms
   .
   #)Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Legionella
   -- Continue to trend daily LFTs
   -- f/u EBV, CMV,

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presents with increasing oxygen requirement and chest X-ray findings consistent with multifocal pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with Legionella multilobar pneumonia and is currently receiving IV antibiotics. Her respiratory status remains very tenuous, and there is concern for progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is also experiencing a mixed acid-base disorder, with ongoing respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. Other medical complications include anemia, arthralgias/rash, transaminitis, and depression. The patient is currently on ICU care, including nutrition support, arterial line placement, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is described as very tenuous, and there is concern for progression to ARDS due to the worsening pneumonia. ARDS is a serious condition that can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which is characterized by an elevated blood pH and bicarbonate level. This condition can lead to symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and muscle weakness. It needs to be managed by controlling the underlying cause and addressing electrolyte imbalances.
3. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient is also experiencing respiratory acidosis, which occurs when there is an accumulation of carbon dioxide in"

   extensive left lower lobe and left upper lobe airspace opacities,
   finding consistent with progression of the known pneumonia that might
   be  complicated by interval development of ARDS.
   Bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded. Overall, no findings to

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3972**] is a 49yo female with no significant PMH who presents with
   increasing oxygen requirement and cxray findings consistent with
   multifocal PNA.
   .
   #) Legionella Multilobar pneumonia: Chest X-ray appears worse with
   diffuse bilateral infiltrated at the bases, respiratory status
   continues to be very tenuous.
   -- Continue Levaquin, Azithromycin IV for now given lack of clinical
   response, although double coverage may not be necessary later
   -- Appreciate ID team following
   -- F/U pending serologies: HIV, EBV, CMV, Leptospira, RMSF, Parvovirus,
   Lyme, Erlichia
   -- Atrovent nebs / Albuterol nebs schedules
   -- Low threshold for intubation, appears patient is progressing to
   ARDS.
   -- If Decreased mental status, hypercarbia > 70 refractory to bipap
   trial or overall deterioration, will need intubation.
   -- Hi flow O2 supplementation
   .
   #. Mixed Acid Base Disorder: Ongoing respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic alkalosis.
   A) Metabolic Alkalosis:
   -- Control nausea to avoid emesis and acid loss
   -- Scheduled Zofran, NPO for now
   -- Replete Potassium with KCl as pt has metabolic hypochloremic
   acidosis
   -- NS for maintenance fluids to replete chloride and reverse component
   of contraction alkalosis
   B) Respiratory Acidosis:
   -- Hi Flow oxygen to reduce tachypnea
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct with rapid change, suspect spurrious result
   -- Repeat today
   -- Transfuse for Hct < 25
   .
   #)Arthralgias/rash: Patient initially had arthralgias and rash, all of
   which have resolved at this time. She may initially have had a viral
   illness and now have a superimposed bacterial infection given her
   pneumonia.
   -- Monitor daily for symptoms
   .
   #)Transaminitis: Likely secondary to Legionella
   -- Continue to trend daily LFTs
   -- f/u EBV, CMV,
   -- HIV negative
   #)Depression: Continue Celexa 20mg PO daily.
   #)FEN: NPO for now
   #)Prophylaxis: Enoxaparin prophylaxis, PPI not needed
   #)Access: PIV, a line
   #)Dispo: Pending clinical improvement

   Ms. [**Known lastname 3972**] is a 49yo female with no significant PMH who presents with
   increasing oxygen requirement and cxray findings consistent with
   multifocal PNA.
   1) Legionella Multilobar pneumonia: Chest X-ray appears worse with
   diffuse bilateral infiltrated at the bases, respiratory status
   continues to be very tenuous.
   -- Continue Levaquin, adjust dose to 500mg from 750mg given long
   anticipated treatment. Continue Azithromycin IV for now given lack of
   clinical response, although double coverage may not be necessary later
   -- Appreciate ID team following
   -- F/U pending serologies: HIV, EBV, CMV, Leptospira, RMSF, Parvovirus,
   Lyme, Erlichia
   -- Atrovent nebs / Albuterol nebs schedules
   -- Low threshold for intubation, appears patient is progressing to
   ARDS.
   -- If Decreased mental status, hypoxia or hypercarbia > 70 refractory
   to bipap trial or overall deterioration, will need intubation.
   -- Hi flow O2 supplementation
   2) Mixed Acid Base Disorder: Ongoing respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic alkalosis.
   a) Metabolic Alkalosis:
   -- Control nausea to avoid emesis and acid loss
   -- Discontinue Percocet as this is likely causing nausea
   -- Avoid phenergan as this appears to worsen mental status
   significantly
   -- Scheduled Zofran, NPO for now
   -- Replete Potassium with KCl as pt has metabolic hypochloremic
   acidosis
   -- NS for maintenance fluids to replete chloride and reverse component
   of contraction alkalosis
   b) Respiratory Acidosis:
   -- Hi Flow oxygen to reduce tachypnea
   3) Anemia: Stable
   -- Transfuse for Hct < 25
   4)Depression: Continue Celexa 20mg PO daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with no significant past medical history presenting with increasing oxygen requirement and chest X-ray findings consistent with multifocal pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with Legionella multilobar pneumonia and is currently in the ICU. Her respiratory status remains very tenuous, and she is experiencing symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. She has a mixed acid-base disorder with ongoing respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. Her anemia is stable, and she is being treated for depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Legionella Multilobar Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows diffuse bilateral infiltrated at the bases, indicating worsening pneumonia. This condition can lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's progressive respiratory status, there is a concern for the development of ARDS. ARDS is a severe form of lung injury that can result in significant respiratory compromise and may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.

3. Mixed Acid-Base Disorder: The patient has ongoing respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis. If not managed appropriately, this disorder can lead to further complications such as hypoxemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and multi-organ dysfunction.

4. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and worsening respiratory status due to aspiration risk.

5. Anemia: Although the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with respiratory distress and was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia, specifically community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient has shown improvement in apical consolidations but still has persistent diffuse bilateral airspace opacities. Vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in blood pressure. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and IV fluids. Laboratory results indicate normal WBC count, slightly elevated Hct and Plt levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows a PICC line terminating in the mid SVC and persistent diffuse bilateral airspace opacities. Microbiology results are positive for Legionella urinary antigen but negative for Legionella in sputum culture. The patient has peripheral edema, hypoxemia, liver function abnormalities, anemia, and a history of depression. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, arterial line, PICC line, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to persistent hypoxemia and bilateral airspace opacities.
2. Sepsis secondary to bacterial pneumonia.
3. Liver dysfunction indicated by elevated liver enzymes.
4. Anemia requiring further evaluation and management.
5. Peripheral edema which could indicate fluid overload or right heart failure.
6. Depression history may complicate the patient's recovery process.
7. Risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient, a 49-year-old female with no significant past medical history, presented with respiratory distress and was diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia.
- She has been experiencing increasing oxygen requirements and her chest X-ray shows diffuse bilateral infiltrates.
- The patient has been started on antibiotics for Legionella multilobar pneumonia and is currently on azithromycin IV.
- She has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, for which she was initially given promethazine and then switched to Zofran due to improvement in symptoms.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/65 mmHg to 115/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and some abnormal liver function tests.
- Imaging studies reveal left-sided PICC terminating in the mid superior vena cava and improvement in apical consolidations but persistent diffuse bilateral airspace opacities.
- Microbiology tests indicate positive Legionella urinary antigen and negative sputum culture for Legionella.
- The patient's assessment and plan include continuing levofloxacin at a reduced dose, monitoring for clinical response, following up with serologies for various infections, providing respiratory support,"
