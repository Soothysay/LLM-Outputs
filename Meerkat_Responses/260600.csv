   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She presented today for cardiac catheterization due to progressive dyspnea and underwent the procedure. The patient has been transferred to the CCU due to concerns about post-cath bleeding. 

The patient has a moderately large hematoma but hemodynamics are stable and hematocrit (hct) levels have only decreased slightly. The plan is to recheck hct in 4 hours, type and crossmatch the patient's blood, hold transfusion for now, follow up with a final read of the CT scan, and perform serial exams while monitoring vitals. 

The patient's coronary arteries are known to have three-vessel disease (3VD) with previous CABG. After an elective coronary angiogram (ETT) showed apical ischemia and a hypokinetic septum, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization today. The results showed patent grafts with no interventions performed. 

The patient has an ejection fraction (EF) of 60% based on a recent technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography (MIBI) scan, indicating no current heart failure. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a history of hypothyroidism for which she takes levothyroxine. 

The patient is on cardiac diet, has peripheral intravenous (PI"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She presented today for cardiac catheterization and is now being transferred to the critical care unit (CCU) due to concerns about post-catheterization bleeding.

The patient has a moderately large hematoma, as shown on CT scan, without retroperitoneal bleeding. She has been experiencing dropping systolic blood pressures in the 80s and a decreasing hematocrit level down to 29.5. This suggests ongoing bleeding, especially with the increasing abdominal pain on examination. There is no visible extension of the hematoma.

The plan includes administering intravenous fluid bolus of 500cc, followed by 1 liter at 100cc/hr, and holding Plavix since there is no stent in the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). One unit of red blood cells (RBCs) will be given, and the hematocrit will be rechecked, with additional units given thereafter. Hematocrit will be checked every six hours. A repeat CT scan will be done stat to assess for any change in hematoma size. Serial exams will be performed, and a call will be made to vascular surgery to assess for possible open intervention. Monitoring of vitals will continue, and the holding of beta-blockers will be maintained.

The patient has known three-vessel disease (3VD) with prior CAB"

   Chief Complaint:
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who underwent
   a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath
   bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, now s/p
   surgical removal.
   24 Hour Events:
   Plavix was stopped yesterday due to her bleeding risk. Patient had low
   SBPs in the 80's in the morning, was given 2 units PRBC and IVF and her
   pressures came up to the 100s.  Had Hct increase to 32 with2 units of
   blood.  Repeat abd CT/pelvis showed improvement of the size of the
   hematoma and no new suspicious areas to explain the patient's low BP.
   Vascular saw the patient and wanted a US to rule out aneurysm and the
   US showed a 2.2 cm pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery
   near the site of the puncture.  There was also a thrombus seen in the
   right common femoral vein.  The patient was taken to surgery overnight
   where the psuedoaneurysm was removed and her hematoma was evacuated.
   She was started on a heparin gtt for the thrombus.  As her Hct
   decreased to 26 on recheck, she was given 1 unit PRBC overnight.
   This am she reports some burning at the site of surgery.  Denies chest
   pain, SOB, dizziness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and severe left main (LM) disease who underwent cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) due to post-cath bleeding. She was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which was surgically removed. The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including blood transfusions, surgical removal of the pseudoaneurysm, and evacuation of the hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure (BP) has been fluctuating, with readings in the 80s and 100s. This could indicate ongoing bleeding or hemodynamic compromise.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to invasive procedures and prolonged hospital stay.
3. Thrombosis: The presence of a thrombus in the right common femoral vein suggests a risk of further clot formation and potential embolization.
4. Kidney injury: The elevated levels of creatinine and BUN indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which may be related to dehydration or acute kidney injury.
5. Coagulopathy: The prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) suggest a bleeding tendency, further increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain and the presence of a large hemat"

   a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath
   bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, now s/p
   surgical removal.
   24 Hour Events:
   Plavix was stopped yesterday due to her bleeding risk. Patient had low
   SBPs in the 80's in the morning, was given 2 units PRBC and IVF and her
   pressures came up to the 100s.  Had Hct increase to 32 with2 units of
   blood.  Repeat abd CT/pelvis showed improvement of the size of the
   hematoma and no new suspicious areas to explain the patient's low BP.
   Vascular saw the patient and wanted a US to rule out aneurysm and the
   US showed a 2.2 cm pseudoaneurysm of the right common femoral artery
   near the site of the puncture.  There was also a thrombus seen in the
   right common femoral vein.  The patient was taken to surgery overnight
   where the psuedoaneurysm was removed and her hematoma was evacuated.
   She was started on a heparin gtt for the thrombus.  As her Hct
   decreased to 26 on recheck, she was given 1 unit PRBC overnight.
   This am she reports some burning at the site of surgery.  Denies chest
   pain, SOB, dizziness.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who presented
   today for cardiac, now being transferred to the CCU given worry for
   post-cath bleeding.
   .
   # HEMATOMA:  CT showed moderately large hematoma with no RPB.  Pt. w/
   dropping SBPs into 80s w/ HCT down to 29.5.  Likely continuing to bleed
   given dropping HCT and increasing abdominal pain on exam, although no
   visible extension of hematoma.
   - IVF bolus 500cc, then 1L at 100cc/hr now
   - Will hold Plavix as no stent in PCI
   - Will give one unit of RBCs, recheck HCT and give another unit
   thereafter.
   - HCT Q6H
   - Repeat CT STAT to assess for change in hematoma size.
   - Serial exams
   - Call Vascular surgery to assess for possible open intervention.
   - Monitor vitals
   - Holding b-blocker
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with prior CABG.  After ETT showed apical
   ischemia and a hypokinetic septum, performed for progressive dyspnea,
   underwent cardiac cath today which showed patent grafts with no
   interventions performed.
   - Continue with aspirin, statin
   - Will hold beta-blocker
   # PUMP:  EF of 60% on MIBI done last month.  Not currently in failure.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for severe left main (LM) disease. She presented today for cardiac reasons and is now being transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) due to concerns about post-catheterization bleeding.

The patient has experienced several significant events during her 24-hour stay in the ICU. An ultrasound of the right femoral site was performed at 04:09 PM, followed by an OR SENT at 08:45 PM. The patient received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and intravenous fluids (IVF), which helped increase her hematocrit level to 32. The patient's low blood pressure in the morning was also addressed, and she now has blood checking every 4-6 hours. A repeat abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed an improvement in the size of the hematoma and no new suspicious areas to explain the patient's low blood pressure. A vascular consultation was requested, and the decision to stop aspirin was pending further recommendations.

The patient has a known allergy to latex, resulting in a rash. No recent antibiotics have been administered. The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate for pain management. Other medications include heparin sodium at a rate of 1,450 units per hour and various ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs indicate a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She underwent cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the cardiac care unit (CCU) due to post-cath bleeding. The patient was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery and underwent surgical removal.

The patient's current condition includes a continued thrombus in the common right femoral vein, oozing from the operative site, and a drop in hematocrit (HCT) levels. She is being treated with heparin sodium infusion, and there is a concern for possible retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) as well.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:
1. Thrombosis: The presence of a thrombus in the common right femoral vein indicates a risk of further clot formation and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Hemorrhage: The ongoing oozing from the operative site and drop in HCT levels suggest ongoing bleeding, which may require additional interventions to control the hemorrhage and prevent further blood loss.
3. Retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed): The concern for RP bleed indicates a risk of bleeding into the retroperitoneal space, which can be a serious complication requiring immediate attention and management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for severe left main coronary artery disease. She experienced post-catheterization bleeding and was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which required surgical removal. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring due to ongoing bleeding and hematoma formation. She has been diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right femoral vein and has undergone placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. Her hematocrit (HCT) levels have been stabilized after receiving a total of six units of blood transfusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hematoma expansion: The patient has an increasing size of hematoma in the space of Retzius, associated with a femoral vascular catheter, with increased retroperitoneal component and extension into the right inguinal region. This indicates a potential risk of further hematoma expansion.
2. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a DVT in the right femoral vein, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately. The IVC filter placed may reduce this risk but does not eliminate it completely.
3. Infection: The presence of a surgical site infection or wound complications due to the recent surgical intervention cannot be ruled out.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with a history of CAD, s/p CABG for severe LM disease who underwent
   a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath
   bleeding, found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, now s/p
   surgical removal.  HC stabilizing.
   # HEMATOMA/PSEUDOANEURYSM:  Patient is s/p repair of pseudoaneurysm
   from [**2198-11-24**], was started on heparin gtt for DVT with continued
   bleeding w/ some extension into retroperitoneum and thigh.  She had a
   IVC filter placed, Plavix was d/ced as was heparin.  HCT now stabilized
   after total of 6U at 30.
   - Dced Plavix as no stent
   - Repeat HCT at 1000, if  HCT stable, can monitor [**Hospital1 **].  Active T&S, 2
   large bore IVs
   - Appreciate vascular consult, will f/u recs.
   - Pt. may OOB to chair today.
   # DVT.  Right femoral DVT in post op setting.  Pt. off heparin now w/
   IVC filter.  This places her at higher risk of IVC thrombosis, but
   given uncertainty whether the bleeding has definitively stopped, will
   not anticoagulate now.
   - Pt. may require OP anticoagulation given IVC filter, this should be
   assessed post ICU setting once HCT is stable.
   # CORONARIES:  Known 3VD with prior CABG.  After ETT showed apical
   ischemia and a hypokinetic septum, performed for progressive dyspnea,
   underwent cardiac cath which showed patent grafts and had a POBA to the
   distal LAD.
   - Continue aspirin and statin
   - Will restart beta-blocker 12.5BID low dose if HCT stable at 1000 and
   SBP > 100mmHg
   # PUMP:  EF of 60% on MIBI done last month.  Not currently in failure.
   # RHYTHM:  In sinus rhythm.

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent a cardiac catheterization and was admitted to the CCU due to post-cath bleeding. She has a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery, which has been surgically repaired. The patient's hematoma has been extending into the retroperitoneum and thigh, causing concern for potential complications.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/58 mmHg to 131/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 30.4%, indicating anemia. The white blood cell count is within normal range. The platelet count is slightly low. The creatinine level is normal, and the blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient has undergone several imaging tests, including a CT pelvis, which revealed a slight interval increase in the size of a hematoma in the space of Retzius associated with a femoral vascular catheter, with increased retroperitoneal component and extension into the right inguinal region. An ultrasound confirmed the presence of a thrombosis in the right common femoral vein, while no left leg deep vein thrombosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She then developed post-catheterization bleeding, which led to the discovery of a pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery. The patient underwent surgical removal of the pseudoaneurysm and was started on heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, she experienced continued bleeding, which extended into the retroperitoneum and thigh. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and the patient was taken off heparin. Her hematocrit (HCT) levels have stabilized at around 30. There is no evidence of further bleeding. The patient is currently on aspirin and has two large bore intravenous (IV) lines. She continues to be actively monitored for any signs of bleeding or complications.

The patient's DVT in the right femoral vein has been managed with an IVC filter, which poses a higher risk of IVC thrombosis but is necessary given the uncertainty about the cessation of bleeding. The decision to anticoagulate will be assessed post-ICU setting once the HCT is stable.

In terms of coronary artery disease management, the patient's known three-vessel disease (3VD) with prior CABG is being monitored. After experiencing apical ischemia and a hypokinetic"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She presented with cardiac issues and is now in the critical care unit (CCU) due to post-cardiac catheterization bleeding.

The patient had continued bleeding on heparin yesterday, so an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and her heparin was stopped. She is now only on aspirin. The patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) yesterday. Her hematocrit (Hct) level has been stable at around 29%. Metoprolol was restarted at 12.5 mg. The patient's jaw drain was removed, and no new recurrences were observed. Her Foley catheter was also removed. The plan is for her to ambulate today and possibly be called out to the floor tomorrow morning if her Hct remains stable.

The patient has a history of latex allergy and rash. There is no mention of recent antibiotic use. The patient is on several infusions and other ICU medications, including metoprolol, which was restarted at 12.5 mg. Other medications include aspirin.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/48 to 136/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1655 mL, with inputs through the oral route (800 mL), total parenteral nutrition (TF) at 600 mL, and intravenous fluids (IVF) at 255 mL. Total output includes 2230 mL through the urine, 350 mL through the nasogastric tube (NG), 250 mL through the stool, and 350 mL through the drains. The fluid balance is negative at 575 mL.

The patient has no respiratory support and is breathing comfortably. The physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the heart, lungs, abdomen, or extremities. The patient has a significant swelling in her right thigh but no change from yesterday, with echymotic skin examination.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 5.6 to 5.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) levels between 11.3 g/dL and 13.1 g/dL, platelet count between 165 and 179 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) levels between 0.5 and 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose levels between 62 and 121 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal limits.
