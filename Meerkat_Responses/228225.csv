   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Unclear etiology, differential is broad
   including hypoxic or hypercarbic state, hypotension or secondary to
   sedative agents used for intubation earlier in the day, less likely.
   More concerning for acute central event given DC/CV with subsequent
   respiratory event.  Infectious process also on differential given
   recent pneumonia, but may be nosocomial infection given 6 day
   hospitalization.  Less likely causes include uremia, encephalopathy, or
   myxedema coma.  After discussion with pharmacy the half life of
   propofol in the elderly is markedly prolonged especially with prolonged
   infusions.  This may likely be the cause of her AMS, however will rule
   out other causes as well.
   - ABG on arrival
   - Full set of labs including lytes, LFTs, CBC, TSH, lactate
   - UA, UCx, Sputum, blood culture, c diff
   - Intubate for airway protection
   - Urine Tox screen
   - Likely will need Head CT/EEG once hemodynamically stable
   - Change sedation to fentanyl and versed
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway with significant crackles bilaterally.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   initially secondary to episode of a fib with RVR in the setting of
   diastolic dysfunction and pneumonia with previous intubation from [**9-29**]
   until [**10-5**].
   - CXR on arrival
   - Antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn
   - Intubate on arrival for airway protection
   - Diuresis with IV lasix, will use lasix drip if pressures cannot
   tolerate boluses
   - Ventilator care
   - Nebs PRN
   .
   # Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to A fib with RVR on arrival
   vs. infectious process.
   - DC/CV on arrival
   - Pressor support PRN - with levophed instead of dopamine given
   tachycardia
   - Antiobiotics as above
   - Follow up culture data
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Trend CE's
   - 12 lead EKG on arrival
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin
   - Hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now
   - If the patient is determined to be a candidate for MVR, will likely
   need coronary catheterization prior to consideration for valve
   replacement
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function.  Valvular disorders including severe
   mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation may be contributing to
   patient's dyspnea/respiratory arrest.  If the patient is truly
   symptomatic from mitral regurgitation, she would meet criteria for
   valve replacement.  If her symptoms are secondary to other causes, she
   may still meet criteria given severe nature, presence of pulmonary
   hypertension and possible new recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
   However, in the setting of recent altered mental status, hypotension,
   and respiratory failure will likely not pursue aggressive intervention
   at this time.
   - Repeat TTE in AM / Compare images to [**Location (un) **]
   - Consult CT [**Doctor First Name **] for possible valve replacement
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Lasix PRN as above
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive.
   - DC/CV on arrival
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Check TSH.  Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # Crohn's Disease:  No acute issues, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration:  Continue brimonidine eye drops and
   PreserVision
   .
   # History of CVA:  Effected her right eye and is s/p left sided CEA.
   Continue plavix and pravastatin.  No aspirin secondary to PUD.
   .
   # PUD:  Continue home PPI
   .
   # Osteoporosis:  Continue actonel weekly
   .
   FEN:  Nutrition will need to be addressed in AM, will likely need tube
   feeds, unclear why the patient was maintained on TPN - consider speech
   and swallow as well as nutrition consult.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was transferred from another location for evaluation of respiratory arrest. 

The patient's current medical conditions include altered mental status (AMS) of unclear etiology, respiratory failure, hypotension, coronary artery disease (history of quadruple CABG), pump dysfunction (diastolic heart failure with preserved systolic function), rhythm disturbances (rapid atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response), hypothyroidism, Crohn's disease, macular degeneration, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with right eye involvement, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), osteoporosis, and malnutrition (FEN). 

The patient's current treatments and interventions include intubation for airway protection, sedation switched from propofol to fentanyl/versed, antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (Vanc/Zosyn), pressor support as needed with levophed, diuretics (Lasix) for fluid management, and anticoagulation with heparin. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Infectious Process: The patient has a recent history of pneumonia and is currently on antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia. There is a possibility of a nosocomial infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of respiratory arrest.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status (AMS), respiratory failure, hypotension, and potential coronary artery disease. The AMS could be due to various causes such as hypoxic or hypercarbic state, hypotension secondary to sedative agents, or an acute central event. The respiratory failure may be secondary to pneumonia or a nosocomial infection.

The patient has a history of quadruple CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) and has not been reevaluated since then. There is no evidence of acute ischemia, and the patient is currently on Plavix and pravastatin.

The patient also has diastolic heart failure with preserved systolic function, and valvular disorders are contributing to her symptoms. She meets criteria for valve replacement, but further evaluation is needed before pursuing aggressive intervention.

The patient has a history of rapid atrial fibrillation after a DC cardioversion and amiodarone/digoxin loading, resulting in bradycardia and junctional rhythm. On arrival, the patient was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypotensive.

The patient has several other medical conditions, including hypothy"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Suspect most likely to oversedation, however
   cannot r/o stroke, infectious process.  TSH and metabolic profile WNL.
   - ABG this afternoon
   - Full set of labs including lytes, LFTs, CBC, TSH, lactate
   - UA, UCx, Sputum, blood culture, c diff
   - Continue intubatation for airway protection until MS improves
   - Urine Tox screen pending
   - Hold sedation if tolerated.
   - CT head to r/o CVA/ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  ABG with elevated PO2 this AM therefore FiO2
   decreased, CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for volume
   overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR
   - CXR on arrival
   - Antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**]) x7d; will
   f/u with ID re: need for Cefepime
   - Follow volume status and diuresis as indicated for volume overload,
   will aim to keep even today
   - Ventilator care
   - Nebs PRN
   - ABG later today
   .
   # Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to A fib with RVR on arrival
   vs. infectious process.  Also concern for hypovolemia given recent
   diuresis and hypotension secondary to oversedation.
   - DC/CV on arrival
   - Pressor support PRN - with levophed instead of dopamine given
   tachycardia
   - Antiobiotics as above
   - Follow up culture data
   - f/u CVP. SVO2
   - 1 unit PRBC for volume and to increase Hct
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Trend CE's
   - 12 lead EKG on arrival
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin
   - Hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now
   - If the patient is determined to be a candidate for MVR, will likely
   need coronary catheterization prior to consideration for valve
   replacement
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function.  Valvular disorders including severe
   mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation may be contributing to
   patient's dyspnea/respiratory arrest.  If the patient is truly
   symptomatic from mitral regurgitation, she would meet criteria for
   valve replacement.  If her symptoms are secondary to other causes, she
   may still meet criteria given severe nature, presence of pulmonary
   hypertension and possible new recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
   However, in the setting of recent altered mental status, hypotension,
   and respiratory failure will likely not pursue aggressive intervention
   at this time.
   - Repeat TEE in AM / Compare images to [**Location (un) **]
   - Consult CT [**Doctor First Name **] for possible valve replacement
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Lasix PRN as above
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive.
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   - Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   .
   # Cool LUE:  Will r/o clot given A fib with RVR, risk of clot vs.
   compartment syndrome.
   - Arterial study of RUE
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH WNL, continue levothyroxine at home doses.
   .
   # Crohn's Disease:  No acute issues, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration:  Continue brimonidine eye drops and
   PreserVision vitamin supplementation.
   .
   # History of CVA:  Effected her right eye and is s/p left sided CEA.
   Continue plavix and pravastatin.  No aspirin secondary to PUD.
   .
   # PUD:  Continue home PPI
   .
   # Osteoporosis:  Continue actonel weekly

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.
- She was transferred from another location for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
- The patient's altered mental status is suspected to be due to oversedation, but cannot be ruled out as a stroke or infectious process.
- Her respiratory failure had resolved, but she was unable to protect her airway upon arrival.
- The patient's hypotension has been secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response on arrival versus an infectious process.
- She also has a history of quadruple CABG, with no evidence of acute ischemia.
- The patient has diastolic heart failure with preserved systolic function, valvular disorders including severe mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.
- She has recent history of rapid atrial fibrillation following DC/CV and amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional rhythm.
- The patient's cool left upper extremity will be evaluated for clot given atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, risk of clot versus compartment syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Stroke: The patient's altered mental status may indicate the possibility of a stroke. Further evaluation is needed"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Unclear etiology, differential is broad
   including hypoxic or hypercarbic state, hypotension or secondary to
   sedative agents used for intubation earlier in the day, less likely.
   More concerning for acute central event given DC/CV with subsequent
   respiratory event.  Infectious process also on differential given
   recent pneumonia, but may be nosocomial infection given 6 day
   hospitalization.  Less likely causes include uremia, encephalopathy, or
   myxedema coma.  After discussion with pharmacy the half life of
   propofol in the elderly is markedly prolonged especially with prolonged
   infusions.  This may likely be the cause of her AMS, however will rule
   out other causes as well.
   - ABG on arrival
   - Full set of labs including lytes, LFTs, CBC, TSH, lactate
   - UA, UCx, Sputum, blood culture, c diff
   - Intubate for airway protection
   - Urine Tox screen
   - Likely will need Head CT/EEG once hemodynamically stable
   - Change sedation to fentanyl and versed
   - CT head to r/o CVA/ischemia
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway with significant crackles bilaterally.  [**Month (only) 11**] have been
   initially secondary to episode of a fib with RVR in the setting of
   diastolic dysfunction and pneumonia with previous intubation from [**9-29**]
   until [**10-5**].
   - CXR on arrival
   - Antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn x7d; will f/u with ID re:
   need for Cefepime
   - Intubate on arrival for airway protection
   - Diuresis with IV lasix, will use lasix drip if pressures cannot
   tolerate boluses
   - Ventilator care
   - Nebs PRN
   - ABG later today
   .
   # Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to A fib with RVR on arrival
   vs. infectious process.
   - DC/CV on arrival
   - Pressor support PRN - with levophed instead of dopamine given
   tachycardia
   - Antiobiotics as above
   - Follow up culture data
   - f/u CVP. SVO2
   - 1 unit PRBC for volume and to increase Hct
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Trend CE's
   - 12 lead EKG on arrival
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin
   - Hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now
   - If the patient is determined to be a candidate for MVR, will likely
   need coronary catheterization prior to consideration for valve
   replacement
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function.  Valvular disorders including severe
   mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation may be contributing to
   patient's dyspnea/respiratory arrest.  If the patient is truly
   symptomatic from mitral regurgitation, she would meet criteria for
   valve replacement.  If her symptoms are secondary to other causes, she
   may still meet criteria given severe nature, presence of pulmonary
   hypertension and possible new recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
   However, in the setting of recent altered mental status, hypotension,
   and respiratory failure will likely not pursue aggressive intervention
   at this time.
   - Repeat TEE in AM / Compare images to [**Location (un) **]
   - Consult CT [**Doctor First Name **] for possible valve replacement
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Lasix PRN as above
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive.
   - DC/CV on arrival
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   - Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   .
   # Cool LUE:  Will r/o clot given A fib with RVR, risk of clot vs.
   compartment syndrome.
   - Arterial study of RUE
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Check TSH.  Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # Crohn's Disease:  No acute issues, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration:  Continue brimonidine eye drops and
   PreserVision
   .
   # History of CVA:  Effected her right eye and is s/p left sided CEA.
   Continue plavix and pravastatin.  No aspirin secondary to PUD.
   .
   # PUD:  Continue home PPI
   .
   # Osteoporosis:  Continue actonel weekly
   .
   FEN:  Nutrition will need to be addressed in AM, will likely need tube
   feeds, unclear why the patient was maintained on TPN - consider speech
   and swallow as well as nutrition consult.

   Disposition: CCU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred from another location for evaluation of respiratory arrest. The patient is currently unresponsive and unable to protect her airway.

The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, which may be due to prolonged propofol infusion in the elderly. Other potential causes such as hypoxic or hypercarbic state, hypotension, infectious process, uremia, encephalopathy, or myxedema coma are also considered but less likely. Further evaluation is planned, including an ABG, full set of labs, urine toxicology screen, and head CT/EEG once the patient is hemodynamically stable.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of diastolic dysfunction and pneumonia. Antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has been initiated, and intubation for airway protection is planned.

Hypotension is another concern, possibly due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response or an infectious process. Pressor support with levophed has been started, and antibiotics have been initiated.

In terms of coronary artery disease, the patient has a history of quadruple CABG and no evidence of acute ischemia. Monitoring of cardiac enzymes"

   Assessment and Plan
 This is an 86 yr old pt w hx-CABG, severe MR/TR, pulm HTN,
   Afib(coumadin), CVA who was admitted  to OSH EW [**9-29**] with palpitations
   and weakness.
   She was found to be in rapid a-fib with RVR. She was cardioverted into
   NSR, but became bradycardic to the 30s and cyanotic and was intubated
   and started on dopamine. She was also started on IV amiodarone after
   bolus.
   -[**9-30**] she went into junctional rhythm and amiodarone was d/c.
   -[**10-4**] she was loaded with digoxin. [**10-5**] she went back into AF with
   rate in 70-90s and was tolerating it. She is presumed to have a
   community aquired PNA and is on levoquin.
   [**10-6**] AM-pt was extubated at -09:30  and was sating in low 90s on 35%
   ventimask. She was still somnulent, but rouseable and was following
   commands. She was on heparin at 250 units/hr, heparin at 5 mcg/kg and
   TPN at 42cc/hr. (It is unclear why she is receiving TPN and not tube
   feedings.) She is being transfered this afternoon [**10-6**] to be evaluated
   for valve replacement. She is full code.
   [**10-6**]-she arrived in CCU at 17:45 with SBP- in 80s, minimally
   responsive, intermittently gurgling. She was in A-fib with HR in 110
   to 130s with occasional PVCs. She was on heparin at 250 units/hr and
   5mcg/kg dopamine. Dopamine was increased and then changed to levophed.
   It was decided to intubate her and then cardiovert her. She was fully
   cultured. It was determined her BP readings were unreliable d/t hx left
   sc syndrome/obstruction and an ALINE was inserted in rt radial. Pt was
   switched from rocephin/levoquin to  Vanco/Zosyn and switched off
   initial sedation choice of propfol (had been on x 5 days at OSH) to
   versed/fentanyl, which were d/c by 12am d/t hypotension. Pt remains on
   low dose pressor, in SR, afebrile and somnolent off sedation currently.
   Family have been in to speak w CCU team and appear to understand
   current progress/plan of care.
   [**Date range (1) 8734**]- Pt to CT
 (-) for acute neuro change- thought to have
   somnolence d/t long term sedation/propofol. Pt increasingly alert since
   all sedation d/c 12am [**10-7**]. TEE postponed until [**10-8**] AM. Started on
   tube feeds- NPO after MN. Received 2 u PRBC for Hct 27-29. Remains on
   Levo/heparin gtt. New Rt IJ line inserted/ old TLC d/c.

   PFI: No acute hemorrhage, mass effect, or territorial vascular

   Region of encephalomalacia within the right occipital lobe consistent
   with
   prior infarct. Scattered punctate calcifications throughout the right
   hemisphere consistent with prior granulomatous disease. Scattered
   calcifications within the basal ganglia bilaterally.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Suspect most likely to oversedation, however
   cannot r/o stroke, infectious process.  TSH and metabolic profile WNL.
   CT head negative for acute process.
   - Continue to hold sedation if tolerated.
   - f/u UCx, Sputum, blood culture
   - Continue intubatation for airway protection until MS improves
   - Consider EEG to r/o seizure
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  ABG with elevated PO2 this AM therefore FiO2
   decreased, CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for volume
   overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR, CXR [**10-8**] shows
   evidence of LLL PNA.
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**])
   x7d; will f/u with ID re: need for Cefepime
   - Ventilator care
   - Nebs PRN
   .
   # Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to A fib with RVR on arrival
   vs. infectious process.  Also concern for hypovolemia given recent
   diuresis and hypotension secondary to oversedation.  In sinus rhythm
   since DC cardioversion [**10-7**].
   - Give 250cc bolus as tolerated, monitor I/O and pressure response
   - Hold on pressors (with levophed instead of dopamine given
   tachycardia) unless evidence of end organ ischemia or hypotension which
   is unresponsive to fluids
   - Antiobiotics as above
   - Follow up culture data
   - f/u CVP
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin
   - Hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function.  Valvular disorders including severe
   mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation may be contributing to
   patient's dyspnea/respiratory arrest.  If the patient is truly
   symptomatic from mitral regurgitation, she would meet criteria for
   valve replacement.  If her symptoms are secondary to other causes, she
   may still meet criteria given severe nature, presence of pulmonary
   hypertension and possible new recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
   However, in the setting of recent altered mental status, hypotension,
   and respiratory failure will likely not pursue aggressive intervention
   at this time.  Hypotension likely [**1-26**] hypovolemia, will resuscitate
   with 250cc boluses and monitor BP response and urine output.
   - Repeat TEE in AM / Compare images to [**Location (un) **]
   - 250cc bolus as pt seems dry
   - Monitor I/O
   - Consult CT [**Doctor First Name **] for possible valve replacement once pt stable
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive. In
   NSR since DC cardioversion yesterday.
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   - Continue Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   .
   # Cool LUE:  Will r/o clot given A fib with RVR, risk of clot vs.
   compartment syndrome.  Dopplers of LUE showed normal flow, improved
   with heating pad.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH WNL, continue levothyroxine at home doses.
   .
   # Crohn's Disease:  No acute issues, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration:  Continue brimonidine eye drops and
   PreserVision vitamin supplementation.
   .
   # History of CVA:  Effected her right eye and is s/p left sided CEA.
   Continue plavix and pravastatin.  No aspirin secondary to PUD.
   .
   # PUD:  Continue home PPI
   .
   # Osteoporosis:  Continue actonel weekly
   ICU Care

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a complex medical history, including severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a previous quadruple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient was admitted for evaluation of respiratory arrest and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which could be due to oversedation or underlying conditions such as stroke or an infectious process. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure had resolved, she is unable to protect her airway. The ABG shows elevated PO2 levels, indicating a need for adjustment in FiO2. There is evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia on the recent chest X-ray.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), infectious processes, or hypovolemia. Fluid resuscitation and monitoring of I/O and pressures are recommended.

4. Coronaries: The patient has a history of quadruple CABG and is on Plavix and pravastatin. No evidence of acute ischemia is observed.

5. Pump Dysfunction: The patient has diastolic heart failure with preserved systolic"

   Preliminary Report !! PFI !!
   PFI: No acute hemorrhage, mass effect, or territorial vascular
   infarction.
   Region of encephalomalacia within the right occipital lobe consistent
   with
   prior infarct. Scattered punctate calcifications throughout the right
   hemisphere consistent with prior granulomatous disease. Scattered
   calcifications within the basal ganglia bilaterally.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Suspect most likely to oversedation, however
   cannot r/o stroke, infectious process.  TSH and metabolic profile WNL.
   CT head negative for acute process.
   - Continue to hold sedation if tolerated.
   - f/u UCx, Sputum, blood culture
   - Continue intubatation for airway protection until MS improves
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  ABG with elevated PO2 this AM therefore FiO2
   decreased, CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for volume
   overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR, CXR [**10-8**] shows
   evidence of LLL PNA.
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**])
   x7d; will f/u with ID re: need for Cefepime
   - Ventilator care
   - Nebs PRN
   .
   # Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to A fib with RVR on arrival
   vs. infectious process.  Also concern for hypovolemia given recent
   diuresis and hypotension secondary to oversedation.  In sinus rhythm
   since DC cardioversion [**10-7**].
   - Give 250cc bolus as tolerated, monitor I/O and pressure response
   - Hold on pressors (with levophed instead of dopamine given
   tachycardia) unless evidence of end organ ischemia or hypotension which
   is unresponsive to fluids
   - Antiobiotics as above
   - Follow up culture data
   - f/u CVP. SVO2
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Trend CE's
   - 12 lead EKG on arrival
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin
   - Hold metoprolol and lisinopril for now
   - If the patient is determined to be a candidate for MVR, will likely
   need coronary catheterization prior to consideration for valve
   replacement
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function.  Valvular disorders including severe
   mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation may be contributing to
   patient's dyspnea/respiratory arrest.  If the patient is truly
   symptomatic from mitral regurgitation, she would meet criteria for
   valve replacement.  If her symptoms are secondary to other causes, she
   may still meet criteria given severe nature, presence of pulmonary
   hypertension and possible new recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
   However, in the setting of recent altered mental status, hypotension,
   and respiratory failure will likely not pursue aggressive intervention
   at this time.
   - Repeat TEE in AM / Compare images to [**Location (un) **]
   - Consult CT [**Doctor First Name **] for possible valve replacement
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Lasix PRN as above
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive.
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   - Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation
   .
   # Cool LUE:  Will r/o clot given A fib with RVR, risk of clot vs.
   compartment syndrome.
   - Arterial study of RUE
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH WNL, continue levothyroxine at home doses.
   .
   # Crohn's Disease:  No acute issues, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration:  Continue brimonidine eye drops and
   PreserVision vitamin supplementation.
   .
   # History of CVA:  Effected her right eye and is s/p left sided CEA.
   Continue plavix and pravastatin.  No aspirin secondary to PUD.
   .
   # PUD:  Continue home PPI
   .
   # Osteoporosis:  Continue actonel weekly

   Addendum to Physical Examination:  Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
s Note.  She is
   responsive by opening her eyes.  She tracks the family members at her
   bedside for a short while.
   Medical Decision Making.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 8715**] is an 87 year old woman who was
   transferred for evaluation of her severe mitral regurgitation and
   possible surgical repair to prevent recurrent pulmonary edema.  She has
   developed a hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia but is responding to
   antibiotic therapy.  She is now off pressors and is tolerating fluid
   boluses for blood pressure control.  Her peripheral cyanosis has
   improved.  She is slightly less somnolent today off all sedatives for
   nearly 36 hours.  A TEE today showed only moderate mitral regurgitation
   and mild AS.  She is currently on amiodarone at 400 mg daily.   We plan
   to continue with respiratory support under her sensorium improves.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for evaluation of severe mitral regurgitation and possible surgical repair. She has a history of respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and other medical conditions. Upon admission, she was intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory arrest. The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. She has been receiving sedation, antibiotics, and inotropic support. Her mental status has been altered, but she has shown some improvement over the past day.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, necessitating intubation and mechanical ventilation. Despite improvement, she still requires respiratory support.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which have been managed with fluid boluses and pressor support. The underlying cause of the hypotension is uncertain and requires further investigation.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has contributed to her unstable hemodynamics. She has been on amiodarone for rate control.
4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient developed hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia, which is currently being treated with antibiotics.
5. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation, which may require surgical intervention to prevent recurrent pulmonary edema.

   The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is
   seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The right
   atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
   of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
   Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
   (LVEF= 40 %). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate
   global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
   arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
   aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Suspect most likely to oversedation, however
   cannot r/o stroke, infectious process.  TSH and metabolic profile WNL.
   CT head negative for acute process. Improving (ie: spontaneously opens
   eyes), but not responding fully to commands yet.
   - Continue to hold sedation as tolerated.
   - f/u UCx, Sputum, blood culture
   - Continue intubatation for airway protection until MS improves, but
   hope to aim for extubation later today as tolerated
   - Given improvement, do not feel need EEG; will re-consider EEG if
   mental status does not continue to improve
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for
   volume overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR, CXR [**10-8**]
   shows evidence of LLL PNA. On pressure support now on ventilator.
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**])
   x7d; if spikes through this regimen or resp status or CXR worsens,
   consider adding flagyl to regimen
   - Wean ventilator as tolerated and hopefully aim for extubation later
   today
   - Nebs
   - Chest PT s/p extubation
   .
   # Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to A fib with RVR on arrival
   vs. infectious process.  Also concern for hypovolemia given recent
   diuresis and hypotension secondary to oversedation.  In sinus rhythm
   since DC cardioversion [**10-7**].
   - Hold on pressors (with levophed instead of dopamine given
   tachycardia) unless evidence of end organ ischemia or hypotension which
   is unresponsive to fluids
   - Antiobiotics as above
   - Follow up culture data
   - Was oozing at RIJ site, so monitor BP and Hct
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function.  Valvular disorders including severe
   mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation may be contributing to
   patient's dyspnea/respiratory arrest.  If the patient is truly
   symptomatic from mitral regurgitation, she would meet criteria for
   valve replacement.  If her symptoms are secondary to other causes, she
   may still meet criteria given severe nature, presence of pulmonary
   hypertension and possible new recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
   However, in the setting of recent altered mental status, hypotension,
   and respiratory failure will likely not pursue aggressive intervention
   at this time.  Hypotension likely [**1-26**] hypovolemia, will resuscitate
   with 250cc boluses and monitor BP response and urine output.
   - Monitor I/O
   - Consult CT [**Doctor First Name **] for possible valve replacement once pt stable
   - Given echo finding and decreased EF, systolic and diastolic function;
   start captopril 6.25mg tid and uptitrate as tolerated for afterload
   reduction
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive. In
   NSR since DC cardioversion.
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   - Continue Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation (no coumadin, in case
   considering valvular surgery)
   .
   # Cool LUE:  Dopplers of LUE showed normal flow, warmth improved with
   heating pad and decreased discoloration.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH WNL, continue levothyroxine at home doses.
   .
   # Crohn's Disease:  No acute issues, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration:  Continue brimonidine eye drops and
   PreserVision vitamin supplementation.
   .
   # History of CVA:  Affected her right eye and is s/p left sided CEA.
   Continue plavix and pravastatin.  No aspirin secondary to PUD.
   .
   # PUD:  Continue home PPI
   .
   # Osteoporosis:  Continue actonel weekly
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Tube feeds, per nutrition rec
s. Hold them for now, as might
   extubate later today.
   Glycemic Control:  Monitor blood sugars, she has not been
   hyperglycemic.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred from another location for evaluation of respiratory arrest. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of quadruple CABG and has not been reevaluated since. There is no evidence of acute ischemia. The patient's recent echocardiogram shows left atrial dilation, mild spontaneous echo contrast in the right atrium, moderate global free wall hypokinesis of the right ventricle, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. She also has mild-moderate aortic stenosis, complex atheroma in the descending aorta, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF=40%). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg, and her fluid balance shows an intake of 2,147 mL and output of 1,110 mL. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 27.6%, platelet count (Plt) of 266 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose of 107 mg/dL, and potassium (K+) level of 4.5 mEq/L. The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypotension, coronary artery disease, diastolic dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and several other comorbidities. The patient's assessment and plan include continued intubation for airway protection, antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, weaning of ventilator support, consideration for valve replacement, and monitoring for potential medical complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred from another location for evaluation of respiratory arrest. Upon arrival, she was unable to protect her airway and required intubation. She has a history of quadruple CABG and has not been reevaluated since. There is no evidence of acute ischemia. She also has a history of PUD and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/50 mmHg to 102/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 129.

Her physical examination reveals an irregular heartbeat, loud systolic murmur throughout the precordium, clear to bronchial bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the left lung base, and no pedal edema or grimace on palpation of the abdomen. Her mental status is altered, and she does not respond to commands. Her laboratory results show elevated"

   24 Hour Events:
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2189-10-8**] 10:42 AM
 TRANS ESOPHAGEAL ECHO - At [**2189-10-8**] 01:10 PM
   The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is
   seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. The right
   atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
   of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
   Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
   (LVEF= 40 %). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate
   global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
   arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
   aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
   are moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   aortic valve. There is mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is
   seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate-severe mitral regurgitation. Mild-moderate
   tricuspid regurgitation. Probably mild/moderate aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) **]
   1.2 cm2). Depressed left and right ventricular function (EF 40%).
   Complex atheroma in the descending aorta.
   MAP in mid 60's; ABP around 102/45.  MAP dropped to low 50's, gave
   250cc bolus x2.
   CXR [**10-8**]: Interval increase in left retrocardiac opacity, which may
   represent
   increasing atelectasis, although pneumonia is not excluded in the
   appropriate
   clinical setting.
   Unchanged interstitial abnormality of unknown chronicity, but which
   would
   most often be expected to represent interstitial edema (diffuse
   bilateral interstitial markings).
   RUQ U/S:
   Tiny right-sided pleural effusion. Otherwise, unremarkable abdominal
   ultrasound.
   Increased pressure support this morning because patient with increased
   RR and increased secretions, HR and RR decreased in response to this
   and patient became more comfortable.

   CCU ATTENDING DAILY PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive daily progress note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   today and I agree with the history, physical examination, assessment
   and plan.  I was present during the physical examination and concur
   with its findings.

   Medical Decision Making.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 8715**] is an 87 year old woman who was
   transferred for evaluation of her severe mitral regurgitation and
   possible surgical repair to prevent recurrent pulmonary edema.  She has
   developed a hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia but is responding to
   antibiotic therapy.  She is now off pressors and is tolerating fluid
   boluses for blood pressure control.  Her peripheral cyanosis has
   improved.
   A TEE yesterday showed moderate-severe mitral regurgitation, mild AS,
   and an LVEF = 40%.  She is currently on amiodarone at 400 mg daily.
   Her CXR shows a slightly worse LLL infiltrate probably secondary to
   volume repletion and a pneumonia.
   We plan to continue with respiratory support under her sensorium
   improves.  She is close to weaning criteria.
   The total time for this visit was 40 minutes and over 50% of the time
   was spend coordinating care and discussing case with the family.

","The patient is an 87-year-old woman who was admitted for evaluation of severe mitral regurgitation and possible surgical repair. She has a history of quadruple CABG, Crohn's disease, macular degeneration, hypothyroidism, PUD, osteoporosis, and a previous stroke. 

On admission, the patient was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypotensive. She was intubated due to respiratory arrest, and her initial chest X-ray showed evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia. A transesophageal echo revealed moderate-severe mitral regurgitation, mild aortic stenosis, and an ejection fraction of 40%. 

The patient was started on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and has shown improvement. She has been weaned off pressors and is tolerating fluid boluses for blood pressure control. Her peripheral cyanosis has improved, and she is now on amiodarone at 400 mg daily. 

A repeat chest X-ray showed a slightly worse left lower lobe infiltrate, likely secondary to volume repletion and pneumonia. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, but she is showing some improvement with eye contact and blinking to command. 

The plan is to continue respiratory support until her sensorium improves and she is close to weaning criteria. The attending physician agrees with the history, physical examination, assessment, and plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Suspect most likely to oversedation, however
   cannot r/o stroke, infectious process.  TSH and metabolic profile WNL.
   CT head negative for acute process. Improving (ie: spontaneously opens
   eyes), but not responding fully to commands yet. Concern for no
   significant improvement since yesterday. Also, not moving limbs on
   command, so concern for larger neurologic depression.
   - Continue to hold sedation as tolerated
   - Neuro consult (?consider EEG)
   - f/u UCx, Sputum, blood culture
   - Continue intubatation for airway protection until MS improves, but
   hope to aim for extubation tomorrow as tolerated; not rushing to
   intubate as MS not fully appropriate yet
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for
   volume overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR, and CXR [**10-8**]
   shows evidence of LLL PNA. On pressure support now on ventilator.
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**])
   x7d
   - Check vancomycin trough tomorrow morning
   - Confirm antibiotic dosing based upon renal function
   - Wean ventilator as tolerated and hopefully aim for extubation
   tomorrow, but more based on MS at this point rather than from a
   respiratory standpoint, although a combination of both components
   - Nebs
   - plan for chest PT s/p extubation
   - Lasix 40 IV now, goal -500cc today; as concern for volume overload
   given echo findings and significant fluid given during this
   hospitalization
   .
   # Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to A fib with RVR on arrival
   vs. infectious process.  Also concern for hypovolemia given recent
   diuresis and hypotension secondary to oversedation.  In sinus rhythm
   since DC cardioversion [**10-7**]. Blood pressures significantly improved,
   even now on captopril.
   - Hold on pressors (with levophed instead of dopamine given
   tachycardia) unless evidence of end organ ischemia or hypotension which
   is unresponsive to fluids
   - Antiobiotics as above, especially with low-grade fever, concern for
   septic picture
   - Follow up culture data
   - Continues to ooze at RIJ site, so monitor BP and Hct; Hct stable
   overnight (was supratherapeutic on heparin, but was oozing even when
   not supratherapeutic earlier); put extra dressing or stitch as needed;
   request PICC line placement, so might be able to d/c RIJ if needed, but
   keep central access for now
   - Given higher blood pressure, uptitrate captopril to 25mg tid, as
   tolerated by BP
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function.  Valvular disorders including severe
   mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation may be contributing to
   patient's dyspnea/respiratory arrest.  If the patient is truly
   symptomatic from mitral regurgitation, she would meet criteria for
   valve replacement.  If her symptoms are secondary to other causes, she
   may still meet criteria given severe nature, presence of pulmonary
   hypertension and possible new recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
   However, in the setting of recent altered mental status, hypotension,
   and respiratory failure will likely not pursue aggressive intervention
   at this time.  Feel patient volume-overloaded at this point, s/p
   multiple fluid boluses for hypotension
   - 40 IV lasix now; goal I/O = -500cc today
   - Monitor I/O
   - Consult CT [**Doctor First Name **] for possible valve replacement once pt stable
   - Uptitrate captopril to 25mg tid, as tolerated by BP
   - Continue to hold metoprolol
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive. In
   NSR since DC cardioversion.
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   - Continue Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation (no coumadin, in case
   patient were to go for valvular surgery)
   .
   # Cool LUE:  Dopplers of LUE showed normal flow, warmth improved with
   heating pad and decreased discoloration.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH WNL, continue levothyroxine at home doses.
   .
   # Crohn's Disease:  No acute issues, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration:  Continue brimonidine eye drops and
   PreserVision vitamin supplementation.
   .
   # History of CVA:  Affected her right eye and is s/p left sided CEA.
   Continue plavix and pravastatin.  No aspirin secondary to PUD.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of respiratory arrest. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to oversedation, but it is difficult to rule out other causes such as stroke or infection. Her respiratory failure had resolved, but she is unable to protect her airway. There is evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has been on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (GNR), and the antibiotics will be continued for another 7 days. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and there are concerns about hypotension, possibly due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, infection, or oversedation. The patient's coronary arteries show no evidence of acute ischemia, but she has a history of quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting. She also has diastolic heart failure with preserved systolic function, and valvular disorders may be contributing to her dyspnea. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has been managed with amiodarone and digoxin. She has other medical conditions including hypothyroidism, Crohn's disease, macular degeneration, history of cerebrovascular accident, peptic ulcer disease, and osteoporosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
3. Pressure ulcers
4. Stress ulcers
5. Hypotension secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, infection, or oversedation
6. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and inability to protect the airway
7. Stroke
8. Infection, including hospital-acquired pneumonia (GNR)
9. Valvular heart disease complications, such as worsening heart failure or arrhythmias.
10. Osteoporosis-related complications, such as fractures.
11. Peptic ulcer disease-related complications, such as bleeding or perforation.
12. Crohn's disease-related complications, such as flare-ups or intestinal perforation.
13. Macular degeneration-related complications, such as vision loss.
14. History of cerebrovascular accident-related complications, such as recurrent stroke.
15. History of coronary artery bypass grafting-related complications, such as graft failure or ischemia.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's progress note, and potential medical complications may vary based on the patient's specific condition and medical history."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Suspect most likely to oversedation, however
   cannot r/o stroke, infectious process.  TSH and metabolic profile WNL.
   CT head negative for acute process. Improving (ie: spontaneously opens
   eyes), but not responding fully to commands yet.
   - Continue to hold sedation as tolerated.
   - f/u UCx, Sputum, blood culture
   - Continue intubatation for airway protection until MS improves, but
   hope to aim for extubation later today as tolerated
   - Given improvement, do not feel need EEG; will re-consider EEG if
   mental status does not continue to improve
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for
   volume overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR, and CXR [**10-8**]
   shows evidence of LLL PNA. On pressure support now on ventilator.
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**])
   x7d; if spikes through this regimen or resp status or CXR worsens,
   consider adding flagyl to regimen
   - Wean ventilator as tolerated and hopefully aim for extubation later
   today
   - Nebs
   - Chest PT s/p extubation
   .
   # Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to A fib with RVR on arrival
   vs. infectious process.  Also concern for hypovolemia given recent
   diuresis and hypotension secondary to oversedation.  In sinus rhythm
   since DC cardioversion [**10-7**].
   - Hold on pressors (with levophed instead of dopamine given
   tachycardia) unless evidence of end organ ischemia or hypotension which
   is unresponsive to fluids
   - Antiobiotics as above, especially with low-grade fever, concern for
   septic picture
   - Follow up culture data
   - Continues to ooze at RIJ site, so monitor BP and Hct
 Hct stable
   overnight (was supratherapeutic on heparin, but was oozing even when
   not supratherapeutic earlier)
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin
   - Hold metoprolol for now
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function.  Valvular disorders including severe
   mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation may be contributing to
   patient's dyspnea/respiratory arrest.  If the patient is truly
   symptomatic from mitral regurgitation, she would meet criteria for
   valve replacement.  If her symptoms are secondary to other causes, she
   may still meet criteria given severe nature, presence of pulmonary
   hypertension and possible new recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
   However, in the setting of recent altered mental status, hypotension,
   and respiratory failure will likely not pursue aggressive intervention
   at this time.  Hypotension likely [**1-26**] hypovolemia, will resuscitate
   with 250cc boluses and monitor BP response and urine output.
   - Monitor I/O
   - Consult CT [**Doctor First Name **] for possible valve replacement once pt stable
   - Uptitrated captopril to 25mg tid this morning as BP
s were tolerating
   lower dose yesterday
   - Continue to hold metoprolol
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive. In
   NSR since DC cardioversion.
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   - Continue Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation (no coumadin, in case
   considering valvular surgery)
   .
   # Cool LUE:  Dopplers of LUE showed normal flow, warmth improved with
   heating pad and decreased discoloration.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH WNL, continue levothyroxine at home doses.
   .
   # Crohn's Disease:  No acute issues, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration:  Continue brimonidine eye drops and
   PreserVision vitamin supplementation.
   .
   # History of CVA:  Affected her right eye and is s/p left sided CEA.
   Continue plavix and pravastatin.  No aspirin secondary to PUD.
   .
   # PUD:  Continue home PPI
   .
   # Osteoporosis:  Continue actonel weekly
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Tube feeds, per nutrition rec

   Disposition: CCU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient was transferred from another location for evaluation of respiratory arrest.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypotension, and possible septic picture. The altered mental status may be due to oversedation or an infectious process, although a stroke has been ruled out. The respiratory failure had resolved, but the patient is unable to protect her airway. A chest X-ray shows evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient is on pressure support now on the ventilator.

The patient's hypotension may be secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response upon arrival, an infectious process, or hypovolemia. The patient is in sinus rhythm since being cardioverted.

The patient has a history of quadruple CABG and no evidence of acute ischemia. She is currently taking Plavix and pravastatin, but metoprolol is being held.

The patient has diastolic heart failure with preserved systolic function, and valvular disorders are contributing to her dyspnea and respiratory arrest. If the patient is truly symptomatic from mitral regurgitation, she would meet criteria for valve replacement.

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has caused rapid heart rate and hyp"

   although is flaccid in the lower extremities has positive
   Babinski sign (upper motor neuron lesion).
    -Though the team was consulted to assess her change in mental
   status, her weakness is far more striking.
   -waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 282**] timecourse, most c/w delerium, with her co-morbid
   infection being
   the most likey underlying culprit.
   -she likely does not have CNS infection given that
   she does not have meningismus, and would hold on LP.
   -Seizure is very unlikely
   -Her weakess is diffuse and severe, however the pattern that
   emerges is one of some distal sparing (a so-called ""person in a
   barrel""). The most likely etiology would be due to the patient
   experiencing watershed infarcts especially in the context of
   being hypotensive while being treated for her atrial
   fibrillation.  A head CT was done on [**10-7**] which did not reveal
   an acute hemorrhage or infarction, however, the CT is less
   sensitive than MRI in evaluating for soft tissue infarction.
   Thus, in order to evaluate whether the patient experienced a
   stroke, an head MRI would be recommended.
   -A critical care myopathy could potentially present with weakness in a
   more
   proximal pattern as she has, however, this typically takes longer
   to develop (she has been in the hospital less than one week), and
   is usually less severe.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and quadruple CABG. She was transferred for evaluation of respiratory arrest. Upon arrival, she was in sinus rhythm but subsequently developed hypotension and required DC cardioversion. She has had several episodes of hypotension since then, which have been managed with fluids and medication. The patient also has oozing at the former site of a right internal jugular catheter, for which pressure dressings have been applied. Her mental status has improved significantly, and she is more alert and interactive today. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, but her respiratory status has improved as well. Other medical issues include hypothyroidism, Crohn's disease, macular degeneration, history of CVA, peptic ulcer disease, and osteoporosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to oversedation, stroke, or an infectious process. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Stroke: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypotension, there is a concern for a possible watershed stroke. An MRI of the head and neck is recommended to evaluate for any soft tissue infarction.
3. Critical Care Myopathy: The patient's muscle"

   infection being
   the most likey underlying culprit.
   -she likely does not have CNS infection given that
   she does not have meningismus, and would hold on LP.
   -Seizure is very unlikely
   -Her weakess is diffuse and severe, however the pattern that
   emerges is one of some distal sparing (a so-called ""person in a
   barrel""). The most likely etiology would be due to the patient
   experiencing watershed infarcts especially in the context of
   being hypotensive while being treated for her atrial
   fibrillation.  A head CT was done on [**10-7**] which did not reveal
   an acute hemorrhage or infarction, however, the CT is less
   sensitive than MRI in evaluating for soft tissue infarction.
   Thus, in order to evaluate whether the patient experienced a
   stroke, an head MRI would be recommended.
   -A critical care myopathy could potentially present with weakness in a
   more
   proximal pattern as she has, however, this typically takes longer
   to develop (she has been in the hospital less than one week), and
   is usually less severe.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Suspect most likely to oversedation, however
   cannot r/o stroke, infectious process.  TSH and metabolic profile WNL.
   CT head negative for acute process. Improving (ie: spontaneously opens
   eyes), but not responding fully to commands yet. Concern for no
   significant improvement since yesterday. Also, not moving limbs on
   command, so concern for larger neurologic depression.
   - Continue to hold sedation as tolerated
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u UCx, Sputum, blood culture
   - Continue intubatation for airway protection until MS improves, but
   hope to aim for extubation today as tolerated
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for
   volume overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR, and CXR [**10-8**]
   shows evidence of LLL PNA. On pressure support now on ventilator.
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**])
   x7d
   - f/u vancomycin trough
   - Confirm antibiotic dosing based upon renal function
   - Wean ventilator as tolerated and hopefully aim for extubation today
   - Nebs
   - Plan for chest PT s/p extubation
   - I
s & O
s: goal -500cc today; as concern for volume overload given
   echo findings and significant fluid given during this hospitalization
   .
   # Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to A fib with RVR on arrival
   vs. infectious process.  Also concern for hypovolemia given recent
   diuresis and hypotension secondary to oversedation.  In sinus rhythm
   since DC cardioversion [**10-7**]. Blood pressures significantly improved,
   hypotension resolved.
   .
   # Oozing at RIJ former site:
   -pressure dressings
   -follow Hct
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin
   - captopril 50mg tid
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function.  Valvular disorders including severe
   mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation may be contributing to
   patient's dyspnea/respiratory arrest.  If the patient is truly
   symptomatic from mitral regurgitation, she would meet criteria for
   valve replacement.  If her symptoms are secondary to other causes, she
   may still meet criteria given severe nature, presence of pulmonary
   hypertension and possible new recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
   However, in the setting of recent altered mental status, hypotension,
   and respiratory failure will likely not pursue aggressive intervention
   at this time.  Feel patient volume-overloaded at this point, s/p
   multiple fluid boluses for hypotension
   - goal I/O = -500cc today
   - Consult CT [**Doctor First Name **] for possible valve replacement once pt stable
   - Captopril 50mg po tid
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive. In
   NSR since DC cardioversion.
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   - Continue Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation (no coumadin, in case
   patient were to go for valvular surgery)
   .
   # Cool LUE:  Dopplers of LUE showed normal flow, warmth improved with
   heating pad and decreased discoloration.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH WNL, continue levothyroxine at home doses.
   .
   # Crohn's Disease:  No acute issues, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration:  Continue brimonidine eye drops and
   PreserVision vitamin supplementation.
   .
   # History of CVA:  Affected her right eye and is s/p left sided CEA.
   Continue plavix and pravastatin.  No aspirin secondary to PUD.
   .
   # PUD:  Continue home PPI
   .
   # Osteoporosis:  Continue actonel weekly

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a history of respiratory arrest. She was transferred from another location for further evaluation. 

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypotension, oozing at the right internal jugular vein former site, and coronary artery disease with a history of quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is improving but still not fully responsive. There is a concern for a possible stroke or infectious process. The sedation is being held as tolerated, and a neurology consult is recommended. Further follow-up with the neurology team is advised.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure had resolved, but she is unable to protect her airway. She is currently on pressure support on the ventilator. Antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) will be continued for another 7 days. The plan is to wean the ventilator as tolerated and aim for extubation today. Nebulizers and chest physical therapy (PT) will be planned after extubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of respiratory arrest. 

The patient's current conditions include decreased Hct due to ongoing bleeding from the right internal jugular (RIJ) removal site, altered mental status, respiratory failure, hypotension, oozing at the RIJ former site, coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, valvular disorders, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.2°C, heart rate 94 bpm, blood pressure 107/52 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 100%, and rhythm atrial fibrillation.

The patient has been extubated and is currently on noninvasive ventilation support. She has received various medications including Lasix, captopril, heparin sodium, amiodarone, pantoprazole, and furosemide.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging and microbiology reports are pending.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia, aiming for extubation today, monitoring secretions, and closely watching for signs of volume overload. The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

- The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred from another location for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
- The patient has shown improvement in mental status, but it is still altered. Sedation is being held as tolerated.
- The patient's respiratory failure had resolved upon arrival, but she is unable to protect her airway. She is currently on pressure support and mechanical ventilation.
- There is a concern for volume overload given the patient's recent fluid administration and echo findings.
- The patient's hypotension has improved since being in sinus rhythm and receiving captopril.
- The patient has ongoing oozing at the right internal jugular vein removal site, and her hematocrit levels are decreasing. Repeat hematocrit measurements are recommended.
- The patient has a history of quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and may require reevaluation for possible valve replacement in the future.
- The patient's cool left upper extremity improved with a heating pad and decreased discoloration.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities, including hypothyroidism, Crohn's disease, macular degeneration, history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), peptic ulcer disease ("

   Assessment and Plan
 86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive. In
   NSR since DC cardioversion.
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   - Continue Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip for anticoagulation (no coumadin, in case
   patient were to go for valvular surgery)
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function.  Valvular disorders including severe
   mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation may be contributing to
   patient's dyspnea/respiratory arrest.  If the patient is truly
   symptomatic from mitral regurgitation, she would meet criteria for
   valve replacement.  If her symptoms are secondary to other causes, she
   may still meet criteria given severe nature, presence of pulmonary
   hypertension and possible new recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
   However, in the setting of recent altered mental status, hypotension,
   and respiratory failure will likely not pursue aggressive intervention
   at this time.  Feel patient volume-overloaded at this point, s/p
   multiple fluid boluses for hypotension
   - goal I/O = -500cc today
   - Consult CT [**Doctor First Name **] for possible valve replacement once pt stable,
   extubated
   - Captopril 37.5mg po tid
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin
   - Captopril 37.5mg tid
   .
   # Decreased Hct/Bleeding from R Neck:  Continued bleeding from prior R
   IJ site, had been bleeding since IJ was placed.  Likely damaged vein in
   neck during IJ placement.  Previously stable hct but this morning with
   decrease in hct from 27 -> 24.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - US neck to evaluate for hematoma
   - Transfuse as needed for rapidly downtrending Hct or Hct<25 given h/o
   CAD
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Likely [**1-26**] oversedation, however cannot r/o
   stroke, infectious process.  TSH and metabolic profile WNL.  CT head
   negative for acute process. Significantly improved, alert and
   interactive currently.  Possible contribution from PNA which is
   currently being treated with Abx.
   - f/u UCx, U/A, sputum, blood culture
 in case infection contributing
   to a delirium picture
   - Full neuro exam today or tomorrow to assess for focal deficet, though
   unlikely
   - Assess pt
s baseline by discussion with family
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for
   volume overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR, and CXR [**10-8**]
   shows evidence of LLL PNA. On pressure support previously, now
   extubated successfully.
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**])
   x7d; today is last day ([**10-12**]).
   - Dosing Vanc by trough; last dose today given trough 16 this AM.
   - Nebs ordered prn
   - Chest PT s/p extubation
   - No Lasix for now; I
s & O
s goal  even today, given hypernatremia and
   lower BP.  Will reassess volume status daily and ensure tight control
   on afterload/SBP to prevent flash pulmonary edema given severe MR.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely secondary to A fib with RVR with component of
   infectious process/sepsis.  Cultures negative to date on Vanc/Zosyn,
   last day of abx today [**10-12**].  Questionable fluid status given
   hypernatremia and lack of pedal edema, but rales on exam (may be [**1-26**]
   atelectasis).  BP improved in sinus [**Date range (1) 8797**].  Blood pressures
   improved this morning in 90
   .
   # Cool LUE:  Dopplers of LUE showed normal flow, warmth improved with
   heating pad and decreased discoloration.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH WNL, continue levothyroxine at home doses.
   .
   # Crohn's Disease:  No acute issues, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration:  Continue brimonidine eye drops and
   PreserVision vitamin supplementation.
   .
   # History of CVA:  Affected her right eye and is s/p left sided CEA.
   Continue plavix and pravastatin.  No aspirin secondary to PUD.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred from another location for evaluation of respiratory arrest. The patient has a history of quadruple CABG, but has not been reevaluated since then. She is currently extubated and on a BiPAP mask. She has been receiving various medications including captopril, hydralazine, amiodarone, Lasix, and heparin.

The patient's recent events include being extubated successfully, experiencing hypotension and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, receiving a Lasix bolus, and having a significant neck oozing at the prior internal jugular (IJ) site. Her Hct has dropped from 27 to 24, so she has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Her blood cultures are growing yeast, and her sputum culture is negative for respiratory flora but shows sparse growth of yeast.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Rhythm: The patient's recent history of rapid atrial fibrillation after direct current cardioversion and amiodarone/digoxin loading resulted in bradycardia and junctional rhythm. Currently, the patient is in normal sinus rhythm since the cardioversion. It is planned to hold AV nodal agents due to"

 86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive. In
   NSR since DC cardioversion until [**10-11**] when patient went back into a
   fib with RVR, currently HR 90s-100s.
   - Continue Amiodarone drip
   - Continue Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue Heparin drip for anticoagulation (no coumadin, in case
   patient were to go for valvular surgery in the near future)
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   at OSH
   .
   # Mitral Regurgitation/Tricuspid Regurgitation:  Mod-severe
   MR/mild-moderate TR on TTE in-house.  Will keep afterload reduced <120
   systolic to prevent flash pulmonary edema with MR.
   - Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function, TTE in-house showed EF 40%.  Valvular
   disorders including severe mitral regurgitation and tricuspid
   regurgitation may be contributing to patient's dyspnea/respiratory
   arrest.  If the patient is truly symptomatic from mitral regurgitation,
   she would meet criteria for valve replacement.  If her symptoms are
   secondary to other causes, she may still meet criteria given severe
   nature, presence of pulmonary hypertension and possible new recurrence
   of atrial fibrillation.  However, in the setting of recent altered
   mental status, hypotension, and recent extubation, will likely not
   pursue aggressive intervention at this time.  Feel patient euvolemic,
   will aim to keep even today.
   - goal I/O = even today
   - Captopril 50mg po tid

   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin and captopril
   .
   # Decreased Hct/Bleeding from R Neck:  Continued bleeding from prior R
   IJ site, had been bleeding since IJ was placed.  Likely damaged vein in
   neck during IJ placement.  Previously stable hct but this morning with
   decrease in hct from 27 -> 24.

   # Respiratory Failure:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for
   volume overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR, and CXR [**10-8**]
   shows evidence of LLL PNA. On pressure support previously, now
   extubated successfully.
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**])

   infectious process/sepsis.  Cultures negative to date on Vanc/Zosyn,
   last day of abx today [**10-12**].  Questionable fluid status given
   hypernatremia and lack of pedal edema, but rales on exam (may be [**1-26**]
   atelectasis).  BP improved in sinus [**Date range (1) 8797**].  Blood pressures
   improved this morning in 90

   Disposition: CCU
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and there is concern about potential sepsis or fluid status issues. Continuous monitoring and adjustments to medication dosages will be necessary.

2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure resolved prior to admission, they are still at risk for pneumonia and require antibiotic coverage. Chest physiotherapy may also be needed post-extubation.

3. Mitral Regurgitation/Tricuspid Regurgitation: The patient has moderate-severe mitral regurgitation and mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. These valvular disorders contribute to diastolic heart failure and could lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been altered, possibly due to oversedation or underlying conditions like infection. Further evaluation is needed, including neurologic exams and additional tests.

5. Decreased Hct/Bleeding from R Neck: The patient is experiencing ongoing bleeding from the right internal jugular (IJ) site, likely due to damage to the vein during IJ placement. Close monitoring of hematocrit levels and transfusion as needed will be necessary.

6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and requires continued monitoring for any signs of acute ischem"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a history of quadruple CABG. She was admitted for evaluation of respiratory arrest and has been in the ICU since then. The patient's recent history includes rapid atrial fibrillation after DC cardioversion, amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional rhythm, hypotension, and an altered mental status. She had a respiratory failure that resolved, but she was unable to protect her airway upon arrival. The patient has a decreased hematocrit due to bleeding from the right neck site, possibly caused by damage to a vein during internal jugular catheter placement. She also has evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray and sputum culture growing gram-negative rods. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and she has been on various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, and cardiac support medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and she has experienced episodes of hypotension, which may be secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response or an infectious process.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which resolved but was followed by an inability to protect her airway"

   Assessment and Plan
 86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive. In
   NSR since DC cardioversion until [**10-11**] when patient went back into a
   fib with RVR, currently HR 90s-100s.  Amio drip complete, rates
   adequately controlled with HRs in 80
s-90
   - Continue Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue Heparin drip for anticoagulation (no coumadin, in case
   patient were to go for valvular surgery in the near future)
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   at OSH
   .
   # Respiratory Status:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for
   volume overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR, and CXR [**10-8**]
   shows evidence of LLL PNA. On pressure support previously, now
   extubated successfully.
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**])
   x7d; today is last day ([**10-12**]).
   - Nebs ordered prn
   - Continue chest PT
   - No Lasix for now; I
s & O
s goal  even today, given hypernatremia and
   lower BP.  Will reassess volume status daily and ensure tight control
   on afterload/SBP to prevent flash pulmonary edema given severe MR.
   .
   # Mitral Regurgitation/Tricuspid Regurgitation:  Mod-severe
   MR/mild-moderate TR on TTE in-house.  Will keep afterload reduced <120
   systolic to prevent flash pulmonary edema with MR.
   - Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function, TTE in-house showed EF 40%.  Valvular
   disorders including severe mitral regurgitation and tricuspid
   regurgitation may be contributing to patient's dyspnea/respiratory
   arrest.  If the patient is truly symptomatic from mitral regurgitation,
   she would meet criteria for valve replacement.  If her symptoms are
   secondary to other causes, she may still meet criteria given severe
   nature, presence of pulmonary hypertension and possible new recurrence
   of atrial fibrillation.  However, in the setting of recent altered
   mental status, hypotension, and recent extubation, will likely not
   pursue aggressive intervention at this time.  Feel patient euvolemic,
   will aim to keep even today.
   - goal I/O = even- (-)500cc today
   - Captopril 50mg po tid
   - Pending resolution of acute issues, will consider consulting CT [**Doctor First Name **]
   for possible valve replacement in the future
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin and captopril
   .
   # Decreased Hct/Bleeding from R Neck:  Continued bleeding from prior R
   IJ site, had been bleeding since IJ was placed.  Likely damaged vein in
   neck during IJ placement.  Previously stable hct but this morning with
   decrease in hct from 27 -> 24.  US negative for fistula/hematoma.
   - Daily Hct
   - Transfuse as needed for rapidly downtrending Hct or Hct<25 given h/o
   CAD
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Likely [**1-26**] oversedation, however cannot r/o
   stroke, infectious process.  TSH and metabolic profile WNL.  CT head
   negative for acute process. Significantly improved, alert and
   interactive currently.  Possible contribution from PNA which is
   currently being treated with Abx.  Cultures only significant for sparse
   growth of yeast in sputum x2.
   - Sputum Cx
   - Full neuro exam today or tomorrow to assess for focal deficet, though
   unlikely
   - Assess pt
s baseline by discussion with family
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely secondary to A fib with RVR with component of
   infectious process/sepsis.  Cultures negative to date on Vanc/Zosyn,
   last day of abx today [**10-12**].  Questionable fluid status given
   hypernatremia and lack of pedal edema, but rales on exam (may be [**1-26**]
   atelectasis).  BP improved in sinus [**Date range (1) 8797**].  Blood pressures
   improved this morning in 90

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of respiratory arrest. The patient's recent medical history includes rapid atrial fibrillation after DC cardioversion, bradycardia, and junctional rhythm. She is currently in normal sinus rhythm but has had episodes of rapid ventricular response.

The patient had respiratory failure that resolved, but she was unable to protect her airway upon arrival. Her chest X-ray showed evidence of left lower lobe pneumonia. She has been extubated successfully and is now on pressure support. Antibiotic coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia has been initiated, and nebulizers are ordered as needed. Lasix has been withheld due to hypernatremia and lower blood pressure.

The patient has moderate-severe mitral regurgitation and mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation based on a recent transthoracic echocardiogram. Diastolic heart failure is present, but her systolic function is preserved with an ejection fraction of 40%. Valvular disorders may be contributing to her dyspnea and respiratory arrest. She meets criteria for valve replacement, but further intervention is pending resolution of acute issues.

The patient has a history of quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting in 2169 and is currently on Plavix,"

   hematoma identified.
   Assessment and Plan
 86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive. In
   NSR since DC cardioversion until [**10-11**] when patient went back into a
   fib with RVR, currently HR 90s-100s.  Amio drip complete, rates
   adequately controlled with HRs in 80
s-90
   - Continue Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Transition over to Coumadin today; continue Heparin drip for bridge
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   at OSH
   .
   # Respiratory Status:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for
   volume overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR, and CXR [**10-8**]
   shows evidence of LLL PNA. On pressure support previously, now
   extubated successfully.
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**])

   lower BP.  Will reassess volume status daily and ensure tight control
   on afterload/SBP to prevent flash pulmonary edema given severe MR.
   .
   # Mitral Regurgitation/Tricuspid Regurgitation:  Mod-severe
   MR/mild-moderate TR on TTE in-house.  Will keep afterload reduced <120
   systolic to prevent flash pulmonary edema with MR.
   - Transition from Captopril 50mg tid to Lisinopril today for afterload
   reduction
   .
   # Renal Failure:  Patient
s baseline Cr 1.1, currently at 1.4; possibly
   [**1-26**] recent ACEi, either transient increase in Cr vs. medication induced
   AIN.
   - Monitor Cr
   - Obtain urine electrolytes, urine eosinophils
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Patient has increasing leukocytosis, but normal PMNs
   with elevated relative Eosinophils, now with watery diarrhea.  Most
   likely [**1-26**] C. diff, believe yeast bacteremia unlikely [**1-26**] negative
   blood cultures and patient is afebrile, not immunocompromised.
   Completed Vanc course for PNA so this should not be contributing to
   leukocytosis; all cultures negative to date except rare yeast on sputum
   culture.
   - C. diff stool studies
   - Trend leukocytosis
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function, TTE in-house showed EF 40%.  Valvular
   disorders including severe mitral regurgitation and tricuspid
   regurgitation may be contributing to patient's dyspnea/respiratory
   arrest.  If the patient is truly symptomatic from mitral regurgitation,
   she would meet criteria for valve replacement.  If her symptoms are
   secondary to other causes, she may still meet criteria given severe
   nature, presence of pulmonary hypertension and possible new recurrence
   of atrial fibrillation.  However, in the setting of recent altered
   mental status, hypotension, and recent extubation, will likely not
   pursue aggressive intervention at this time.  Feel patient euvolemic,
   will aim to keep even today.
   - goal I/O = even- (-)500cc today
   - Transition Captopril 50mg po tid to Lisinopril as above
   - Pending resolution of acute issues, will consider discussing possible
   valve replacement in the future

   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin and captopril
   .
   # Decreased Hct/Bleeding from R Neck:  Continued bleeding from prior R
   IJ site, had been bleeding since IJ was placed.  Likely damaged vein in
   neck during IJ placement.  Previously stable hct but this morning with
   decrease in hct from 27 -> 24.  US negative for fistula/hematoma.  Only
   minimal blood at dressing site today with lower PTT.

   currently being treated with Abx.  Cultures only significant for sparse
   growth of yeast in sputum x2.

   hypernatremia and lack of pedal edema, but rales on exam (may be [**1-26**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of respiratory arrest. The patient has a history of quadruple CABG, Crohn's disease, macular degeneration, hypothyroidism, PUD, osteoporosis, and CVA. She presented with leukocytosis, elevated Eosinophils, watery diarrhea, and a positive sputum culture for GNR. The patient's recent medical interventions include DC cardioversion, amiodarone loading, and heparin drip.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level of 1.1 has increased to 1.4. This may be due to recent ACEi or medication-induced acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has increasing leukocytosis with normal PMNs and elevated relative Eosinophils. This could be indicative of C. difficile infection or another underlying cause.
3. Mitral Regurgitation/Tricuspid Regurgitation: The patient has moderate-severe MR and mild-moderate TR. These valvular disorders may contribute to the patient's dyspnea and respiratory arrest.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had episodes of altered mental status, which may"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. She was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of respiratory arrest. The patient has a history of quadruple CABG, Crohn's disease, hypothyroidism, macular degeneration, PUD, osteoporosis, and CVA. 

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient had altered mental status initially but has improved and is now alert and interactive. It could be due to oversedation or an underlying stroke/infectious process. Further assessment is needed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure, which resolved at the previous location but returned upon arrival. She had an extubated successfully and is now on pressure support. She has a sputum culture growing GNR, and her chest X-ray shows evidence of LLL PNA. Antibiotic coverage for HAP is ongoing.
3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive likely secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and an infectious process. Cultures negative to date, and the last day of antibiotics is today. Fluid status is questionable, but rales are present on examination.
4. Decreased Hct/Bleeding from R Neck: The patient has ongoing bleeding from the right internal jugular site, which was likely damaged during the placement."

   Imaging: US Neck [**10-12**]:
   Small nonocclusive thrombus seen within the right IJ at the level of
   the recent puncture. There is no pseudoaneurysm. No AV fistula and no
   hematoma identified.
   Assessment and Plan
 86 yo female with severe mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid
   regurgitation, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation transferred
   from [**Location (un) **] for evaluation of respiratory arrest.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has recent history of rapid A fib s/p DC/CV and
   amiodarone/digoxin loading with subsequent bradycardia and junctional
   rhythm.  On arrival, patient was in A fib with RVR and hypotensive. In
   NSR since DC cardioversion until [**10-11**] when patient went back into a
   fib with RVR, currently HR 90s-100s.  Amio drip complete, rates
   adequately controlled.
   - Continue Amiodarone po 200mg daily
   - Continue Heparin drip for anticoagulation (no coumadin, in case
   patient were to go for valvular surgery in the near future)
   - Small doses of IV Esmolol or Metoprolol as needed for rate control
   - Will hold AV nodal agents in the setting of recent junctional rhythm
   at OSH
   .
   # Respiratory Status:  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient's
   respiratory failure had resolved, however on arrival patient unable to
   protect airway.  CXR on arrival was not especially concerning for
   volume overload or pneumonia, however sputum growing GNR, and CXR [**10-8**]
   shows evidence of LLL PNA. On pressure support previously, now
   extubated successfully.
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for HAP - Vanc/Zosyn (start date [**10-6**])
   x7d; today is last day ([**10-12**]).
   - Nebs ordered prn
   - Continue chest PT
   - No Lasix for now; I
s & O
s goal  even today, given hypernatremia and
   lower BP.  Will reassess volume status daily and ensure tight control
   on afterload/SBP to prevent flash pulmonary edema given severe MR.
   .
   # Mitral Regurgitation/Tricuspid Regurgitation:  Mod-severe
   MR/mild-moderate TR on TTE in-house.  Will keep afterload reduced <120
   systolic to prevent flash pulmonary edema with MR.
   - Captopril 50mg tid for afterload reduction
   # PUMP:  The patient has diastolic heart failure on most recent echo,
   but preserved systolic function, TTE in-house showed EF 40%.  Valvular
   disorders including severe mitral regurgitation and tricuspid
   regurgitation may be contributing to patient's dyspnea/respiratory
   arrest.  If the patient is truly symptomatic from mitral regurgitation,
   she would meet criteria for valve replacement.  If her symptoms are
   secondary to other causes, she may still meet criteria given severe
   nature, presence of pulmonary hypertension and possible new recurrence
   of atrial fibrillation.  However, in the setting of recent altered
   mental status, hypotension, and recent extubation, will likely not
   pursue aggressive intervention at this time.  Feel patient euvolemic,
   will aim to keep even today.
   - goal I/O = even- (-)500cc today
   - Captopril 50mg po tid
   - Pending resolution of acute issues, will consider consulting CT [**Doctor First Name **]
   for possible valve replacement in the future
   .
   # CORONARIES:  History of quadruple CABG in [**2169**], has not been
   reevaluated since.  No evidence of acute ischemia.  No ASA given
   history of PUD.
   - Continue plavix and pravastatin and captopril
   .
   # Decreased Hct/Bleeding from R Neck:  Continued bleeding from prior R
   IJ site, had been bleeding since IJ was placed.  Likely damaged vein in
   neck during IJ placement.  Previously stable hct but this morning with
   decrease in hct from 27 -> 24.  US negative for fistula/hematoma.
   - Daily Hct
   - Transfuse as needed for rapidly downtrending Hct or Hct<25 given h/o
   CAD
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Likely [**1-26**] oversedation, however cannot r/o
   stroke, infectious process.  TSH and metabolic profile WNL.  CT head
   negative for acute process. Significantly improved, alert and
   interactive currently.  Possible contribution from PNA which is
   currently being treated with Abx.  Cultures only significant for sparse
   growth of yeast in sputum x2.
   - Sputum Cx
   - Full neuro exam today or tomorrow to assess for focal deficet, though
   unlikely
   - Assess pt
s baseline by discussion with family
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely secondary to A fib with RVR with component of
   infectious process/sepsis.  Cultures negative to date on Vanc/Zosyn,
   last day of abx today [**10-12**].  Questionable fluid status given
   hypernatremia and lack of pedal edema, but rales on exam (may be [**1-26**]
   atelectasis).  BP improved in sinus [**Date range (1) 8797**].  Blood pressures
   improved this morning in 90
   .
   # Cool LUE:  Dopplers of LUE showed normal flow, warmth improved with
   heating pad and decreased discoloration.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH WNL, continue levothyroxine at home doses.
   .
   # Crohn's Disease:  No acute issues, continue to monitor.
   .
   # Macular Degeneration:  Continue brimonidine eye drops and
   PreserVision vitamin supplementation.
   .
   # History of CVA:  Affected her right eye and is s/p left sided CEA.
   Continue plavix and pravastatin.  No aspirin secondary to PUD.
   .
   # PUD:  Continue home PPI
   .
   # Osteoporosis:  Continue actonel weekly
