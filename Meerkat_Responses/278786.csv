   1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
   demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had no angiographically
   apparent disease. The LAD had a patent stent and no angiographically
   apparent disease. The Cx had no angiographically apparent disease. The
   RCA had a distal 95% stenosis with TIMI 2 flow into the more distal
   branches.
   2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated left sided filling
   pressure of 30 mmHg (LVEDP). The central aortic pressure was 97/58
   mmHg.
   There was no transaortic gradient on pullback from the LV to the aorta.
   3. Left ventriculography revealed a calculated LVEF of 34%. There was
   hypokinesis of the posterobasal, inferior, apical and anterolateral
   walls.

   # CORONARIES:  This is a woman with a Right Dominant system and early
   onset 1V CAD in the LAD that accelerated slowly between [**2186**]-[**2190**] and
   is now 1V CAD involving the RCA s/p Inferiolateral MI with akinesis in
   other territories. This will have to be sorted out. Her Killip Class is
   1, her TIMI score is 6 (DM, sBP < 100, weight < 67 and time to tx >
   4hrs). Her 30 day mortality risk is 16%. The acceleration of her plaque
   burden in the RCA is brisker than expected. Her risk factors are Fhx,
   uncontrolled IDDM, Dyslipidemia and cocaine abuse. She received 2 DES.
   - confirm plaque burden
   - continue plavix 75 mg for at least one year
   - integrillin x 18 hours
   - aspirin 325 daily, likely to d/c on 81mg daily
   - atorvastatin 80 daily, then 80 of simvastatin on dc (price)
   - beta blockade likely safe in cocaine, will use labetalol for now
   allowing for theoretical but doubtful interactions

   dysfunction, with an EF of 45% in [**2186**] and 35% by [**2193-1-12**] LVgram. This

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of one-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with crescendo chest pain, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and desaturation on dual antiplatelet therapy. She has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and polysubstance abuse. She underwent coronary angiography, which revealed one-vessel disease with distal 95% stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient also has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 34% and hypokinesis in multiple wall segments. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications:
- Myocardial ischemia or infarction due to persistent RCA stenosis
- Heart failure due to reduced left ventricular function (LVEF of 34%)
- Arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation

2. Diabetes-related complications:
- Hyperglycemia due to uncontrolled IDDM
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)

3. Substance abuse-related complications:
- Cocaine-induced cardiomyopathy or exacerbation of CAD progression
- Infectious diseases, such as HIV or hepatitis C, associated with drug use

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of one-vessel coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction (MI), and drug-eluting stent placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). She presented with crescendo chest pain and was found to have a STEMI with a second stent placement in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient has been diagnosed with two-vessel disease, and further evaluation revealed a calculated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 34%. There is hypokinesis of multiple walls of the left ventricle.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has a history of one-vessel CAD and recent STEMI, indicating ongoing ischemia and potential for further ACS events.
2. Heart Failure: With a reduced LVEF of 34%, the patient is at risk for heart failure, particularly given the presence of diastolic dysfunction as well.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient's sinus rhythm needs to be monitored, and rate control may be necessary.
4. Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD): Diminished distal pulses and known popliteal vessel lesions suggest PAD, which can lead to increased cardiovascular risk and potential complications such as critical limb ischemia.
5. Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient's poorly controlled DM increases the risk of accelerated atherosclerosis and related complications.

   1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
   demonstrated one vessel disease. The LMCA had no angiographically
   apparent disease. The LAD had a patent stent and no angiographically
   apparent disease. The Cx had no angiographically apparent disease. The
   RCA had a distal 95% stenosis with TIMI 2 flow into the more distal
   branches.
   2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an elevated left sided filling
   pressure of 30 mmHg (LVEDP). The central aortic pressure was 97/58
   mmHg.
   There was no transaortic gradient on pullback from the LV to the aorta.
   3. Left ventriculography revealed a calculated LVEF of 34%. There was
   hypokinesis of the posterobasal, inferior, apical and anterolateral
   walls.
   Assessment and Plan
    44F with hx of 1 vessel CAD s/p MI [**2186**], CYPER to LAD in [**2186**], IDDM,

   onset 1V CAD in the LAD that accelerated slowly between [**2186**]-[**2190**] and
   is now 1V CAD involving the RCA s/p Inferiolateral MI with akinesis in
   other territories. This will have to be sorted out. Her Killip Class is
   1, her TIMI score is 6 (DM, sBP < 100, weight < 67 and time to tx >
   4hrs). Her 30 day mortality risk is 16%. The acceleration of her plaque
   burden in the RCA is brisker than expected. Her risk factors are Fhx,
   uncontrolled IDDM, Dyslipidemia and cocaine abuse. She received 2 DES.
   - confirm plaque burden
   - continue plavix 75 mg for at least one year
   - integrillin x 18 hours

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of one-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous myocardial infarction (MI), who presented with crescendo chest pain, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and drug-eluting stent (DES) placement in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). She has now been diagnosed with two-vessel disease involving the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient's Killip Class is 1, TIMI score is 6, and 30-day mortality risk is 16%. Her risk factors include family history, uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), dyslipidemia, and cocaine abuse. She received two DES.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Accelerated plaque burden in the RCA.
2. Diastolic dysfunction.
3. Systolic dysfunction with an EF of 45% in [**2186**] and 35% by [**2193-1-12**] LVgram.
4. Uncontrolled IDDM with complications.
5. Substance abuse with positive cocaine and benzodiazepines in urine.
6. Hyperlipidemia with last LDL 170, TG > 200.
7. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with diminished DP pulses.
8. Tobacco abuse.
9. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of one-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with crescendo chest pain and was diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) involving the right coronary artery (RCA). She has now been diagnosed with two-vessel CAD.
- The patient has a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (DM) and substance abuse, including cocaine use.
- She has been experiencing low blood pressure, with systolic blood pressure (sBP) readings in the 80s for many years.
- The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has decreased from 45% in a previous visit to 35% on this admission, indicating diastolic and systolic dysfunction.
- She also has peripheral artery disease (PAD) with diminished distal pulses bilaterally and is currently on nicotine patches for tobacco abuse.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's chronic low blood pressure and recent episodes of hypotension may lead to complications such as organ hypoperfusion or shock.
2. Diabetic complications: The patient's uncontrolled diabetes increases the risk of further cardiovascular events, neuropathy, and other diabetic complications.
3. Myocardial ischemia/re-infarction: With her history of CAD and recent STEMI,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of one-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with crescendo chest pain and was found to have a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent dual angioplasty with stenting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the right coronary artery (RCA). Subsequently, she was diagnosed with two-vessel CAD. The patient has a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), uncontrolled with complications, as well as polysubstance abuse.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been running low, with systolic blood pressure (sBP) in the 80s for many years. Monitoring and medication adjustments are being made to maintain the goal sBP between 80-100.
2. Diabetic Complications: The patient has uncontrolled IDDM, which is likely contributing to her rapid CAD progression. She also has profound diabetic neuropathy due to uncontrolled diabetes. Insulin therapy and close monitoring of blood glucose levels are necessary.
3. Substance Abuse: The patient tested positive for cocaine and benzodiazepines in her urine. A social work consult has been requested to address substance abuse issues and provide counseling against drug use.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has now been diagnosed with two-vessel CAD involving the RCA. Continued antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel"

   Assessment and Plan
   44F with hx of 1 vessel CAD s/p MI [**2186**], CYPER to LAD in [**2186**], IDDM,
   and Polysubstance abuse presents with 3-4 days of crescendo chest pain,
   STEMI and DES x2 to RCA. This is a new diagnosis of 2 vessel disease.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with a right dominant system and early onset 1V
   CAD in the LAD that accelerated slowly between [**2186**]-[**2190**] and is now 1V
   CAD involving the RCA s/p Inferiolateral MI with akinesis in other
   territories. The acceleration of her plaque burden in the RCA is more
   accelerated than expected. Her risk factors are Fhx, uncontrolled IDDM,
   Dyslipidemia and cocaine abuse. She received 2 DES to RCA on [**1-12**].
   - continue plavix 75 mg for at least one year
   - continue aspirin 325 daily, likely to d/c on 81mg daily
   - continue atorvastatin 80 daily, then 80 of simvastatin on dc (price)
   - will transition captopril 3.125mg TID to low dose lisinopril 5mg
   daily today
   - CCB (dilt) was ordered but HR was in the 60-70s and BP low in the
   70s-100s yesterday so CCB was discontinued
   - counsel regarding cocaine
   .
   # PUMP: She has known diastolic dysfunction as well as systolic
   dysfunction, with an EF of 45% in [**2186**] and 35% by [**2193-1-12**] LVgram. This
   could reflect a component of stunned myocardium. The major concern is
   that hers is a right dominant system with proven collaterals to left
   and this is an RCA infarct; in this stunned state she is preload
   dependent.
   - TTE today
   - hold all nitrates
   - no BB for now given cocaine abuse, will continue low dose ACEI as
   above
   - O2 to prevent pulm vasoconstriction
   - fluids if sBP < 90
   .
   # IDDM, uncontrolled with complication: Ms [**Known lastname 10954**] has never had a
   normal A1c in our system. Uncontrolled DM is likely the most important
   factor in her rapid CAD progression.  Patient also has profound
   diabetic neuropathy as a result of uncontrolled diabetes.
   - SQ insulin: [**Hospital1 **] NPH per patient home dose with SS
   - QACQHS fingersticks
   - f/u on Hga1c
   - sw consult for medication assistance
   - patient will need [**Last Name (un) 72**] referral for better glucose control
   .
   # Substance Abuse: Patient with positive cocaine and benzo's in urine,
   in addition to methadone. When broached with patient, she became
   tearful and very upset; denied using cocaine adamantly.
   - SW consult
   - counsel against drug use
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: cholesterol 266, triglyceride 323, HDL 41, LDL 160.
   - continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily in house, then simvastatin 80mg on
   dc (price)
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient in Sinus.
   - goal heart rate between 55-70
   - can use ccb for rate control if needed
   .
   # PAD: Patient with 1 block claudication, diminished DP pulses
   bilaterally.
   - continue aspirin and statin
   .
   # Tobacco Abuse: patient counselled.  She is doing well on nicotine
   patch.
   - continue nicotine patch
   - counselling against smoking

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of one-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She presented with crescendo chest pain and was diagnosed with a STEMI and underwent dual vessel coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient has accelerated CAD involving the right coronary artery (RCA), which resulted in an inferolateral MI. She also has diastolic and systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45% in [**2186**] and 35% by [**2193-1-12**] LVgram. The patient has uncontrolled DM, substance abuse issues, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco abuse. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating in the 70s-100s range, indicating possible hypotension. It is important to monitor and manage her blood pressure to prevent further complications.
2. Diabetic complications: The patient's uncontrolled DM puts her at risk for further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperglycemia, or hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of her blood glucose levels is necessary.
3. Substance abuse: The patient's positive cocaine and benzodiazepines in her urine indicate ongoing substance abuse. This increases the risk of recurrent cardiac events and other complications"
