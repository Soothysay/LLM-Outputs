   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 382**] year-old female with a  history of CAD s/p MI, HTN, DM,
   hypothyrodism, depression, CVA (non-verbal at baseline) and recent
   [**Hospital1 54**] discharge for acute CHF who presents with tachypnea and
   non-responsiveness.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:Patient presented with severe tachypnea
   with O2 sats in upper 80s on RA that were responsive to increased FiO2.
   Because tachypnea was not improving, patient was intubated in the ED.
   Etiology concerning for PNA as CXR finding of retrocardiac density.
   Would be hospital acquired as patient discharge day prior to admission.
   Of note, most recent admission consistent with volume overload with
   patient responding to diuresis. No evidence of volume overload on exam
   or CXR.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired PNA -
   vancomycin, cefepime
   - f/u sputum sample
   - ventilator to pressure support, wean as tolerated, vent respiratory
   bundle
   - versed and fentanyl to maintain minimal sedation
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Probable source lung vs. urine. Patient just
   completed course of cephalexin for ?UTI on last admit. CXR finding,
   respiratory distress, and recent hospital admission concerning for
   hospital-aquired PNA. WBC up from discharge.
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics for HAP
   - Follow-up blood, urine, send sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   - repeat CXR after hydration
   .
   # Coffee Ground Emesis: Unclear if coffee ground emesis [**3-4**] UGI bleed
   vs. trauma from OG tube placement. GI aware and to staff patient in am.
   Patient has remained hemodynamically stable overnight. HCT stable from
   recent discharge at 39. Likely [**3-4**] NG trauma.
   - flush G tube as needed, consider removal of NG tube pending GI recs
   - pantoprazole 40mg IV BID
   - trend HCT
   - GI recs in am- unlikely need to scope given no d/c from NG tube
   .
   # Troponin Elevation: Patient with troponin of 0.11 on admission. Admit
   EKG with wider QRS but unable to assess St/T waves due to IVCD and LVH.
   - cycle enzymes
   - continue telemetry
   .
   # CHF, chronic, diastolic and systolic: EF 20-25% on [**12/2112**] echo. No
   evidence of volume overload on exam, pt appears dry w/increased
   creatinine from last admit. Patient did require 4L IVF in ED in the
   setting of hypotension surrounding intubation.
   - will hold ACE-I and spironolactone overnight, consider resuming in am
   - monitor volume status closely, consider resuming lasix in am
   - Monitor I/Os
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine appears to be 1.0. Pt at 1.2
   on last discharge, 1.6 on this admit. Likely prerenal as patient
   appears dry on exam, given infectious process. Bun/Cr >20:1.
   - f/u urine lytes, follow creatinine after IVF
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient has had elevated INR since early [**9-8**] at 1.5.
   Was 1.4 on last admission. Unclear if related to nutritional status.
   Fibrinogen nl on admit so unlikely to be DIC. No history of chronic
   liver disease and LFTs nl on last admit, now mildly elevated on this
   admission.
   - consider trial of vitamin K
   - follow coags, monitor fibrinogen
   .
   # Elevated AST/ALT/LDH: Increased from 10 days ago. Patient with no
   previous history of liver dysfunction. Differential includes toxic
   injury from drugs vs. poor profusion. Did recently complete a course of
   valtrex for v. zoster which can cause hepatitis.
   - f/u LFSs until resolution.
   .
   # Diabetes, type 2: Appears to be diet controlled. No HbA1C in our
   system. On no oral antihyperglycemics.
   - covered with regular insulin sliding scale.
   .
   # Herpes zoster, left T7-8 dermatome:  Completed course of Valtrex on
   most recent admission.
   -Lesions have scabbed over, she does not require precautions.
   .
   # ? Seizure D/O: On Keppra from NH. Will continue.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue outpt regimen.
   .
   # Stage II decubitus pressure ulcers: sacrum and mid-back, local
   wound care continued.
   .
   # FEN: F/u nutrition recs for tube feeds
   .
   # Access: PIV  18 x2, 20 x1- patient is a difficult stick with poor
   access, will attempt PICC today

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, depression, and cerebrovascular accident. She was recently discharged from the hospital for acute congestive heart failure and presented with tachypnea and non-responsiveness. She was intubated in the emergency department due to severe tachypnea and hypoxemia. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to hospital-acquired pneumonia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 64. Her physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, and movement. Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count and troponin level. The patient has several comorbidities including chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, acute renal failure, coagulopathy, elevated liver enzymes, diabetes, herpes zoster, possible seizure disorder, hypothyroidism, and stage II decubitus pressure ulcers.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition can be summarized as follows:

- The patient is in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation.
- They have a history of allergies to no known drugs.
- Antibiotics were administered on 2113-10-4 and 2113-10-6.
- The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and fentanyl.
- Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/68 to 137/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) heart rhythm.
- The patient's weight is 55.7 kg, and height is 61 inches.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 918 mL and output of 675 mL.
- The patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, troponin-T, and lactate levels, while other lab values are within normal ranges.
- The patient has been diagnosed with a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential medical complications that could arise based on this information include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if they dislodge.

3. Stress ulcer: The use of corticosteroids and the stress of critical illness can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.

4. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or wound infections.

5. Medication side effects: Some of the medications being administered to the patient, such as fentanyl, may have potential side effects that need to be monitored.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). He is currently on mechanical ventilation with minimal pressure support. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 123/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and elevated troponin levels indicating possible demand ischemia. He is also experiencing fever, leukocytosis, and a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been immobilized, which increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's ICU stay and use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation, which may lead to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
5. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, coffee ground emesis, demand ischemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM). They are currently receiving cefepime and vancomycin for their infections. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 101/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased potassium levels, and elevated troponin levels. The patient's renal function tests are within normal limits, but their liver function tests show some abnormalities. The patient has a central line, arterial line, and urinary catheter in place. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be prevented by maintaining good airway hygiene and regularly assessing the patient's respiratory status.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility due to critical illness puts them at an increased risk for developing DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as intermittent compression devices and"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/46 to 137/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 37.6°C.

The patient has a history of encephalopathy and is sedated, making it difficult to obtain a complete medical history. Allergies to medications are not reported. The patient has been receiving cefepime and vancomycin for pneumonia treatment since October 6th.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is intubated and ventilated, with clear breath sounds bilaterally. Cardiac examination shows a left bundle branch block (LBBB) and peripheral pulses are assessed but not documented. Neurologic examination shows poor responsiveness.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 16.4 K/uL, slightly decreased hematocrit at 33.4%, and elevated troponin T levels at 0.11. Other lab values, including kidney function tests and electrolytes, are within normal range. Microbiology results show gram-positive cocci in pairs/clusters.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV mode with a FiO2 of 40% and has a SpO2 of 100%. Vital signs include a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/61 mmHg to 123/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 37.2°C. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, for suspected pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). Other medical conditions include tachycardia/ectopy, fever/leukocytosis, elevated troponin levels, congestive heart failure (CHF), and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is also being treated for diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to HAP. The current mode of ventilation is CPAP/PSV with a FiO2 of 40%, and the patient's SpO2 is maintained at 100%. However, there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the underlying infection does not improve or if ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) develops.

2. UTI: The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   #Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to HAP per CXR. Doing well on
   minimal pressure support although continues to have significant
   secretions, poor RSBI. On last CXR appears to have increased size in
   opacity in LLL and sputum with +GPC culture. Would benefit from
   bronchoscopy.  Will reassess in the afternoon but no extubation at this
   point. Continue vancomycin for PNA for appropriate coverage.
   -continue vancomycin, d/c cefepime
   -bronchoscopy this afternoon
   -suction as needed, MDI standing
   -f/u CXR
   #Tachycardia/ectopy: [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pulmonary infection, pain,
   hypovolemia. In setting of poor UOP would not titrate beta blocker.
   Since the ectopy is intermittent, with no EKG changes suggesting
   ischemia, will continue to monitor for now.
   -EKG
   -telemetry
   -IV fluids
   #Fever, leukocytosis: Treating PNA and UTI. At this point has been
   covered with cefepime for 4 days, will d/c as UTI has been treated and
   was likely exacerbated by lack of UOP. Has remained a febrile >48hrs.
   Will continue to follow fever curve, cultures and WBC.
   -f/u cultures
   -trend WBC
   -c.diff cultures to r/o GI infection
   #Decreased UOP: Initially patient was thought to be volume overloaded
   and did not received fluids after ED had given 2L. Over last 48hrs UOP
   was 10-20cc/hr and responsive to boluses. Will continue to bolus as
   needed to maintain UOP of 30cc/hr and monitor for pulmonary edema
   closely given low EF.
   -bolus 250cc NS and titrate for 30cc/hr
   -free water bolus per Gtube
   #Coffee ground emesis: has not recurred since transfer to ICU.
   -trend hct
   -monitor tube output, flush as needed
   -H2O flush
   -continue PPI
   #Elevated troponin: likely demand ischemia, last troponin .08.
   -telemetry
   -on ASA, beta blocker therapy
   #CHF: systolic/diastolic HF. Last 48hrs with low blood pressures and
   minimal UOP. Carvediol d/c
   -monitor fluid status closely with daily wts, strict I/O
   -IV fluids as needed for UOP but with caution to avoid pulm edema
   #DM: ISS, FS
   #Elevated LFTs: have been decreasing slowly, will continue to monitor
   -trend LFTs

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of respiratory failure secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with minimal pressure support and continues to have significant secretions and poor respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The patient also has tachycardia/ectopy, fever, leukocytosis, decreased urine output (UOP), and elevated troponin levels. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient is receiving IV fluids, MDI standing, and suction as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with ongoing secretions and poor RSBI despite minimal pressure support. There is an increased size in opacity in the left lower lobe (LLL) on the latest chest X-ray, indicating worsening of HAP. A bronchoscopy is planned to assess and clear the airways. If the patient does not improve or if there is further deterioration in respiratory function, extubation may not be possible.

2. Tachycardia/ectopy: The patient is experiencing intermittent ectopic beats with a heart rate above the normal range. This could be secondary to pulmonary infection, pain, hypovolemia, or other"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been on minimal pressure support and continues to have significant secretions with poor respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The patient also has a history of tachycardia/ectopy, fever, leukocytosis, decreased urinary output (UOP), coffee ground emesis, elevated troponin levels, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and elevated liver function tests (LFTs).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory failure and HAP put him at risk for further pulmonary complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atelectasis, and worsening gas exchange.

2. Cardiac complications: The patient has CHF, which increases the risk of cardiac complications like arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and fluid overload.

3. Infection-related complications: The patient's current infections, including HAP and possible urinary tract infection (UTI), can lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.

4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of coffee ground emesis may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be exacerbated by stress ulcer disease or other gastrointestinal infections.

5. Renal complications: The patient's decreased UOP and the use of nephrotoxic medications may lead to acute kidney injury (AK"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with minimal pressure support and continues to have significant secretions and poor respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). There is an increase in opacity in the left lower lobe (LLL) on chest X-ray and sputum culture shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible infection.

The patient also has tachycardia and ectopy, which is suspected to be secondary to pulmonary infection, pain, and hypovolemia. There is no EKG change suggesting ischemia, so the patient will continue to be monitored for now.

The patient has fever and leukocytosis, which is being treated for presumed pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). The UTI was likely exacerbated by lack of urine output. Cultures and white blood cell count (WBC) will be followed, and c.diff cultures will be obtained to rule out gastrointestinal infection.

The patient has decreased urine output (UOP), initially thought to be volume overloaded. However, over the last 48 hours, UOP has been responsive to boluses. The goal is to maintain UOP of 30cc/hr and monitor for pulmonary edema closely given the patient's low ejection fraction (EF).

The patient had coffee-ground"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). They have a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and elevated liver enzymes (LFTs). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube and is receiving IV antibiotics for both pneumonia and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible demand ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to HAP. The current plan is to continue minimal pressure support and reassess for extubation in the afternoon. However, no extubation is planned at this point.

2. Tachycardia/Ectopy: The patient has been experiencing tachycardia and ectopy, which may be secondary to pulmonary infection. Monitoring of heart rhythm is ongoing.

3. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient has fever and leukocytosis, which are consistent with a diagnosis of pneumonia and UTI. The patient is currently on vancomycin and cefepime, and follow-up cultures are pending. Trending of WBC count is also recommended.

4. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient has evidence of UTI, likely due to the Foley catheter in place. Continued IV fluids and monitoring of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old female with a chief complaint of non-responsiveness.
- She received an increased amount of free water through her gastrointestinal tube (GTB) and continued to receive normal saline (NS) boluses to maintain a urine output of 30cc/hr.
- The patient's C. difficile test was negative, and a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was sent for cytology, with plans to follow up today.
- A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered to investigate the left bump and lack of urine production despite fluid boluses and free water given through the GTB.
- The patient's sputum culture showed Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive and yeast, so vancomycin was continued, and cefepime was discontinued.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- She is receiving various medications, including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 76 bpm (67-82), blood pressure of 123/67 mmHg (80-136/53-91), respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (19-35), and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.
- The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,681 mL and output of 420 mL, with a positive balance of 3,261 mL.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 25 cmH2O.
- Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 16.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 44 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, and glucose levels ranging from 140-749 mg/dL.
- Other lab values are within normal limits.
- The patient's medical history and allergies are documented.
- The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and her disposition is noted as well.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction. The lack of urine production despite fluid administration could indicate AKI, which may require further evaluation and management.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum culture revealed the presence of Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive and yeast, indicating a possible infection. VAP is a common complication in patients on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Close monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy would be necessary.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although not directly mentioned in the progress note, the patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or pharmacological intervention may be indicated.

4. Stress ulcer: The patient's use"

   Assessment and Plan
   #Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to HAP per CXR. Doing well on
   minimal pressure support although continues to have significant
   secretions, poor RSBI. On last CXR appears to have increased size in
   opacity in LLL and sputum with +GPC culture. Would benefit from
   bronchoscopy.  Will reassess in the afternoon but no extubation at this
   point. Continue vancomycin for PNA for appropriate coverage.
   -continue vancomycin, d/c cefepime
   -bronchoscopy this afternoon
   -suction as needed, MDI standing
   -f/u CXR
   #Tachycardia/ectopy: [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pulmonary infection, pain,
   hypovolemia. In setting of poor UOP would not titrate beta blocker.
   Since the ectopy is intermittent, with no EKG changes suggesting
   ischemia, will continue to monitor for now.
   -EKG
   -telemetry
   -IV fluids
   #Fever, leukocytosis: Treating PNA and UTI. At this point has been
   covered with cefepime for 4 days, will d/c as UTI has been treated and
   was likely exacerbated by lack of UOP. Has remained a febrile >48hrs.
   Will continue to follow fever curve, cultures and WBC.
   -f/u cultures
   -trend WBC
   -c.diff cultures to r/o GI infection
   #Decreased UOP: Initially patient was thought to be volume overloaded
   and did not received fluids after ED had given 2L. Over last 48hrs UOP
   was 10-20cc/hr and responsive to boluses. Will continue to bolus as
   needed to maintain UOP of 30cc/hr and monitor for pulmonary edema
   closely given low EF.
   -bolus 250cc NS and titrate for 30cc/hr
   -free water bolus per Gtube
   #Coffee ground emesis: has not recurred since transfer to ICU.
   -trend hct
   -monitor tube output, flush as needed
   -H2O flush
   -continue PPI
   #Elevated troponin: likely demand ischemia, last troponin .08.
   -telemetry
   -on ASA, beta blocker therapy

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female who is currently unresponsive in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), for which she is being treated with vancomycin. She also has tachycardia/ectopy, fever, leukocytosis, decreased urine output (UOP), coffee ground emesis, elevated troponin levels, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and elevated liver function tests (LFTs).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to HAP. If the infection spreads or if the patient's lung function deteriorates further, she may experience worsening respiratory failure, leading to potential complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, or respiratory arrest.

2. Tachycardia/ectopy: The patient's tachycardia/ectopy could be secondary to pulmonary infection, pain, hypovolemia. If left untreated or if the underlying causes worsen, it may lead to arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, or even cardiac arrest.

3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection, which could be due to the untreated UTI or PNA. If the infection is not appropriately managed, it can progress to sepsis or septic shock, leading to multiple organ dysfunction"

   Assessment and Plan
   #Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to HAP per CXR. Doing well on
   minimal pressure support although continues to have significant
   secretions, poor RSBI. On last CXR appears to have increased size in
   opacity in LLL and sputum with +GPC culture. In the last film the ET
   tube is 1.9cm from the carina. Continue vancomycin for PNA for
   appropriate coverage.
   -continue vancomycin
   -suction as needed, MDI standing
   -Pull ET tube 2 cm.
   -f/u CXR
   #Diaphoresis: on physical exam, patient was excessively diaphoretic.
   Concern for myocardial ischemia;
   -Cycle enzymes
   -EKG
   -Monitor telemetry
   #Tachycardia/ectopy: [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pulmonary infection, pain,
   hypovolemia. In setting of poor UOP would not titrate beta blocker.
   Since the ectopy is intermittent, with no EKG changes suggesting
   ischemia, will continue to monitor for now.
   -EKG
   -telemetry
   -IV fluids
   # Leukocytosis: Treating PNA and UTI. At this point has been covered
   with cefepime for 4 days, will d/c as UTI has been treated and was
   likely exacerbated by lack of UOP. Has remained a febrile >48hrs. Will
   continue to follow fever curve, cultures and WBC.
   -f/u cultures
   -trend WBC
   -c.diff cultures to r/o GI infection
   #Decreased UOP: Patient with very low UOP during last 24 hours. So far
   it has been fluid dependent, but will go slowly for concern for
   pulmonary edema..
   -bolus 250cc NS and titrate for 30cc/hr
   -free water bolus per Gtube

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presents with non-responsiveness and has a history of respiratory failure, likely secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- The patient is currently on minimal pressure support and continues to have significant secretions, poor respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). There is an increased size in opacity in the left lower lobe (LLL) and sputum with +GPC culture.
- Diaphoresis was noted on physical exam, raising concern for myocardial ischemia.
- Tachycardia/ectopy is believed to be secondary to pulmonary infection, pain, and hypovolemia.
- Leukocytosis is present, likely due to treating pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI).
- Decreased urine output (UOP) is a concern, with the patient being fluid-dependent.
- Coffee ground emesis has not recurred since transfer to the ICU.
- The patient exhibits signs of congestive heart failure (CHF), with systolic/diastolic HF observed in the last 48 hours.
- Liver function tests (LFTs) have increased drastically, possibly due to liver congestion or ischemia.
- Fluid balance is closely monitored with daily weights and strict input/output (I/O) measurements.
- The patient's goals of care will be discussed with the family, and weaning from the ventilator is a priority.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure: Likely secondary to pneumonia
   - On PS 10/5
   Plan: Given that she has an size 7.0 ETT and underlying dementia, a
   RSBI on PS of [**6-5**] not be reflective of her abilty to extubate.  Thus,
   currently on a PS of 10 and therefore we will consider extubating from
   this pressure recognizing that there is a increased risk of failure.
   2) Pneumonia
   - Staph from sputum - on Vancomycin
   Plan: Continue vancomycin
   3) Oliguria: Difficult to discern volume status...will follow urine

   Disposition :
   Total time spent: 35 minutes (patient is critically ill)
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CVA (non-verbal at baseline) who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. She remains intubated and has been difficult to wean from the ventilator. The patient is non-verbal and unable to provide further history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia. This is a serious condition that requires immediate medical intervention.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially progress to sepsis if left untreated.
3. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is difficult to discern, indicating potential oliguria. Oliguria can be a sign of inadequate renal function or fluid imbalance, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
4. Difficulty Weaning from Ventilator: The patient has been difficult to wean from the ventilator, indicating a potential complication in the process of extubation. This increases the risk of post-extubation complications such as airway obstruction, respiratory distress, or infection.
5. Dementia: The patient has underlying dementia, which may affect her ability to communicate and respond to medical interventions. This could complicate the assessment and management of her condition.
6. Code Status: The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with non-responsiveness. The patient has been experiencing high potassium levels, excessive fluid output through the rectal tube, and wheezing in the respiratory system. The patient's vital signs show hypothermia, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. The patient has been extubated but required reintubation due to respiratory failure. The patient's urine output has been low, leading to concerns about possible pulmonary edema. The patient also exhibits diaphoresis, leukocytosis, and evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) with systolic/diastolic dysfunction. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and elevated liver function tests (LFTs) without any identified cause. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) code status and requires discussion regarding goals of care with the family, with a focus on weaning from the ventilator first.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of non-responsiveness and subsequent respiratory failure indicates a high risk for further respiratory complications. Continued monitoring and intervention will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's low urine output and fluid status raise concerns about the development"

   3- CHF (EF 20%): Today, cool extremities with decreased urine output
   and scvo2 of 39% and [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing pattern.  Thus, this may
   be decompensated heart failure.  Will try trial of dobutamine and
   follow closely.
   Addendum: Attempted trial of dobutamine but urine output did not
   improve significantly.  Also, patient remains hypothermic with cool
   clammy extremities.  Respiratory rate increasing and urine output
   falling to almost zero.  Overall, I believe patient has recurrent
   episode of sepsis.  As respiratory status worsening, called her son who
   is clearly wishes to have the patient intubated again.  He continues to
   state that this has happened to her multiple times and she always gets
   better.  Thus, patient was intubated and placed on mechanical
   ventilation.  Will cover with broad-spectrum antibiotics.  Long term
   status will need to be discussed further with the son.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure. She is unresponsive and has poor urine output. The patient has a history of pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, and previous episodes of sepsis. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 113/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She is hypothermic with a temperature of 36.2°C and has cool, clammy extremities. Her blood work indicates elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, slightly elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been receiving dobutamine, antibiotics, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's intermittent respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation indicate a potential complication of acute respiratory failure. She was extubated previously but is now showing signs of respiratory distress again.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is still on antibiotics. There is a possibility of worsening or new infection.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's cool extremities, decreased urine output, and low mixed venous oxygen saturation suggest decompensated heart failure. She is currently on dobutamine, but her"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who presented with non-responsiveness. The patient has a history of decreased urine output, cold and clammy extremities, and poor oxygen saturation. The patient was intubated and received mechanical ventilation. Blood cultures were obtained to rule out sepsis. The patient is currently on vancomycin and meropenem for suspected pneumonia and urinary tract infection. The patient's condition has not improved, with persistent fever, low urine output, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient also has elevated liver function tests, but no clear cause has been identified. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, with an estimated ejection fraction of 15%. The patient is being treated with dobutamine to improve cardiac output. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through tube feeds. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's low ejection fraction and symptoms of poor perfusion (cold extremities, low urine output), cardiogenic shock is a potential complication.
2. Sepsis: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures suggests an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate a possible kidney injury.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: Although the liver function tests are elevated, no specific cause has been identified. Further investigation is needed to determine"

   Assessment and Plan
   #Respiratory failure/CHF exacerbation:  Patient was re-intubated
   yesterday for respiratory distress. Most likely multifactorial due to
   pneumonia not covered with vancomycin alone; so meropenem was added.
   CHF exacerbation may be contributing to the respiratory failure.
   -continue vancomycin Day [**6-8**]
   -pt now on meropenem
   -suction as needed, MDI standing
   -f/u CXR
   -Echocardiogram
   #Decreased UOP: Patient with very low UOP during last 24 hours
   (<500cc). Most likely cause is low cardiac output. Will maximize CHF
   treatment
   -bolus 250cc NS as needed
   -Control BP (<140/90)
   # Leukocytosis: Treating PNA and UTI. At this point has been covered
   with cefepime for 4 days, will d/c as UTI has been treated and was
   likely exacerbated by lack of UOP. Has remained a febrile >48hrs. Will
   continue to follow fever curve, cultures and WBC.
   -f/u cultures
   -trend WBC
   -c.diff cultures to r/o GI infection
   #DM: ISS, FS
   #Elevated LFTs: Patient with CT yesterday that did not show any cause
   for elevated LFTs. Trending down.  Patient is not on any hepatotoxic
   levels of current medications.
   -trend LFTs
   #FEN: tube feeds per nutrition recommendations, free water bolus per
   Gtube, replete electrolytes as needed

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male who presented with non-responsiveness. The patient has been decompensated on supplemental oxygen and has poor urine output. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is thin, with pale conjunctiva and poor dentition. His cardiovascular examination is normal, but he has absent radial and dorsal pulses in both arms. His respiratory system examination shows clear breath sounds bilaterally. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal examination reveals muscle wasting, and the neurologic examination shows no response to noxious stimuli.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.9 thousand/mL, elevated lactate level of 1.8 mmol/L, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 114 mEq/L, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 6.3 mEq/L, and elevated liver enzymes including ALT and AST. The patient's blood cultures are positive, indicating an ongoing infection.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure and CHF exacerbation, decreased urine output, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes. The potential complications that can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and CHF exacerbation. The patient required reintubation due to respiratory distress caused by pneumonia not covered with vancomycin alone. Meropenem was added to treat the pneumonia. The patient also has decreased UOP, likely due to low cardiac output, and is being treated for CHF. There is leukocytosis, likely secondary to a treated UTI and ongoing PNA. The patient's LFTs are elevated but trending down, and no cause has been found. The patient's nutrition is being provided through tube feeds, and repletion of electrolytes is ongoing. The patient has a PICC line in place, and prophylaxis is being given for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is DNR, and weaning from the vent is the first step in disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent reintubation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. This could be due to worsening pneumonia or exacerbation of CHF.
2. Decreased UOP: The patient's low urine output may indicate low cardiac output, possibly exacerbated by CHF treatment.
3. Leukocytosis: Although the UTI has been treated, the patient remains febrile and has leukocytosis. Ongoing infection or other causes should be considered.
4. Elevated LFTs: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and CHF exacerbation. He was re-intubated due to respiratory distress caused by pneumonia not covered with vancomycin alone. Meropenem was added to treat the infection. The patient also has decreased urine output, likely due to low cardiac output. He has leukocytosis and has been treated for pneumonia and UTI with cefepime. Elevated liver function tests are being monitored without any identified cause. The patient's code status is DNR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included respiratory failure, which required re-intubation. It is crucial to closely monitor his oxygenation and ventilation parameters, ensuring optimal settings on the ventilator and maintaining adequate oxygenation.
2. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's CHF may contribute to respiratory failure and should be managed accordingly. Monitoring fluid balance, cardiac function, and administering appropriate diuretics or other CHF medications is essential.
3. Pneumonia: Despite receiving vancomycin, the patient developed pneumonia. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or antibiotic resistance is necessary. Adjusting antibiotic therapy if needed and ensuring proper source control are important.
4. Decreased Urine Output: The patient's low urine output needs to be evaluated and managed promptly. Assessing renal function, correcting fluid imbalances, and optimizing cardiac output are important steps to consider.
5. Leukocytosis: Treating the underlying infections and monitoring the patient's white blood cell count and fever curve are essential. Following up on cultures and trend analysis will help determine the effectiveness of the current treatment plan.
6. Elevated Liver Function Tests: Monitoring liver function tests and identifying the cause of elevation is important. Adjusting medications if hepatotoxicity is suspected and continuing to trend LFTs will provide valuable information for patient management.
7. Malnutrition: Considering the patient's prolonged ICU stay and inability to eat orally, ensuring adequate nutritional support is crucial. Tube feeds have been initiated, and nutritional goals should be discussed with the family and healthcare team.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: Repleting electrolytes as needed is important to maintain electrolyte balance and prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.
9. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: Heparin prophylaxis should be continued to prevent DVT, a common complication in critically ill patients.
10. Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP): Implementing strategies to prevent VAP, such as proper oral hygiene, elevation of the head of bed, and regular lung secretion clearance, are important to reduce the risk of developing this complication."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of heart failure, who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and CHF exacerbation. She has undergone a trans-thoracic echo that revealed an EF of 20-30%, apical hypokinesis/septal hypokinesis, RV dilatation, severe PA systolic hypertension, and dilated pulmonary artery. The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation and has not been able to be weaned off the ventilator yet. She is also experiencing decreased urine output, likely due to poor cardiac output. There are signs of leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has yeast in her urine and GPC on BAL. She has been normoglycemic without the need for insulin over several days. The patient's opacities on CXR appear stable from yesterday, and she has not had a fever for approximately 24 hours. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation and has not been able to be weaned off the ventilator yet. This indicates ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Worsening heart failure: The trans-thoracic echo suggests worsening heart failure despite relative improvement in EF.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Acute Respiratory Failure:
   - Failed RSBI
 unable to extubate
   - Family meeting today to discuss extubation vs. tracheostomy
   2) Pneumonia: continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   3) CHF: heart function worse
   4) Acute renal failure: decreased urine output likely secondary to
   decreased cardiac function.  Has received multiple fluid boluses but no
   significant increase in urine output.  Will check urine electrolytes
   and follow BUN/Cr, urine output
   5) FEN: Tube feeds at goal
   6) CVA with baseline non-verbal status
   Overall plan is to discuss goals of care with son later this
   afternoon.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient's condition remains unchanged overnight and they are still on ventilator support. The trans-thoracic echo from yesterday shows worsening heart function. The patient has a history of pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and acute renal failure. They are also diagnosed with a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with baseline non-verbal status. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 124/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 65.7 kg and height is 61 inches. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 20 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 2,326 mL and output of 228 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheter use.
3. Stress ulcers due to the use of corticosteroids and sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure, and feeding tube placement (FEN). His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/75 to 137/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for worsening echo function. He has a positive blood culture for gram-negative rods. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin T levels. His kidney function is impaired with elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged critical illness and use of corticosteroids can lead to stress ulcers.
4. Nosocomial infection: Due to the prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures, the patient is at risk of acquiring nosocom"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-inch, 65.4 kg individual admitted to the ICU. They have been receiving various medications, including lasix, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/59 to 133/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 50%. The patient's ABG results show pH of 7.20, PaCO2 of 20 mmHg, and PaO2 of 100 mmHg. The patient has a radial pulse but has not been assessed for distal pulses or skin condition. Neurologic examination is also not assessed.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. Kidney function appears to be within normal range based on creatinine levels. Troponin-T levels are within normal limits, but there are some abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT/AST and alkaline phosphatase) and electrolyte levels (potassium and phosphorus)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and receiving various medications, including lasix, protonix, and heparin. The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature, slightly low blood pressure, normal heart rate, and respiratory rate. The patient has gained weight since admission. Fluid balance is positive, with a total intake of 3,227 mL and output of 650 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. There are also abnormalities in kidney function and electrolyte levels. The patient's cardiac biomarkers are within normal range. The patient's condition remains unchanged since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given that the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased sputum production, and changes in oxygenation may be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and surveillance for symptoms such as leg swelling or pain may be needed.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critically ill state and the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-inch tall and 65.4 kg male who was admitted with acute respiratory failure and pneumonia. He is currently receiving CPAP support and has improved urine output with the use of lasix. The patient has a history of being non-verbal at baseline and is now unresponsive. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/55 to 129/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block. He has shown improvement in his fluid balance and is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube. The patient is also on prophylactic antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. His code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he will continue to receive ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving CPAP support, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and sputum culture analysis should be done to detect any changes in lung infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheter placement. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation should be"

   Total time spent: 35 (patient is critically ill)
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation through CPAP mode.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's current condition include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already diagnosed with pneumonia, and being on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness are risk factors for developing DVT. Prophylactic measures should be in place to reduce this risk.

3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and the use of certain medications can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like pantoprazole are often used for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

4. Complications related to the CVA: The patient has a pre-existing CVA, which may lead to neurological deficits. There is a risk of further neurological deterioration or other complications associated with the CVA.

5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels have been fluctuating, indicating possible renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show low values, indicating hypotension. This could be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions. Appropriate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female who is currently unresponsive and admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of non-responsiveness. She has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with a low ejection fraction of 15%, diabetes mellitus (DM), and is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient is receiving lasix for decreased urine output, antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and diuretics for CHF exacerbation. She has copious secretions that may impair extubation today. Family meeting will be held to assess goals of care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if extubation fails or if there is a worsening of underlying conditions such as CHF or HAP.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP. The patient is already receiving antibiotics, but regular follow-up and cultures are needed to monitor for any changes or progression of infection.

3. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's low ejection fraction and current negative fluid balance indicate a high risk for further CHF exacerbation. Close monitoring and management of fluid balance, along with ongoing treatment for CHF, are necessary.

4. Hypoglycemia: Despite being on insulin previously, the"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I reviewed pertinent history and lab data and examined patient.  I was
   physically present with the MICU team during the key portions of the
   service provided.  I agree with the note above, including the
   assessment and plan. I would add and emphasize the following:
   I had the chance to talk to her son, [**Name (NI) 4874**], at some length today.  The
   patient has been able to communicate somewhat, both by speech and
   hearing, despite being in a wheelchair, hard of hearing and blind at
   her N.H.  Her son, her proxy, believes that the patient enjoys life
   still enough to want to continue fighting, even to the point of a
   tracheostomy if necessary.  Two yrs ago the pt was intubated for 2
   weeks but was ultimately extubated.  She remains a DNR, and son would
   not want dialsysis if renal failure were to supervene.  He describes
   his mother as not someone to give up.
   On exam: vital signs stable. On vent: PSV 5/5 40% VT= 300
   Patient non responsive.  Lungs clear though ETT secretions still a
   problem. [**Name (NI) 59**] JVD. Cor RRR. Abd- G tube, old zoster lesions.  She
s under

   3.       CAD and CHF with EF =20%
   4.       Renal Insufficiency
   5.       Dispo: DNR but not DNI
   Plan:
   1.       Make I/O 500 cc neg daily
   2.       Continue Vanc, Meropenem
   3.       Restart Coreg for CHF
   4.       Resume free H20
   5.       Once secretions less of a problem and she
s a bit more
   diuresed, then I
d try another extubation attempt and if she fails,
   proceed to trache.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female admitted to the ICU with non-responsiveness. She has a history of CVA dementia, chronic, LLL pneumonia, CAD and CHF with an EF of 20%, renal insufficiency, and DNR status but not DNI. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has copious secretions, which may impair extubation. Her family desires to continue fighting and pursue aggressive measures, including tracheostomy if necessary. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains unresponsive. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Heart failure exacerbation
3. Acute kidney injury
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
5. Stress ulcer bleeding
6. Ventilator-induced lung injury
7. Tracheostomy-related complications

   carvedilol for heart failure, originally on 6.25 changed to 3.125 as
   dropped her pressure.  Vancomycin level yesterday was 21 so vanc was

   Assessment and Plan
   #Respiratory failure: Most likely HAP and CHF exacerbation. Patient on
   antibiotics and active diursesis. Mental status has never been an issue
   for extubation, but her baseline is not-responsive. However, right now
   patient with copious secretions that could impair us from extubating
   her. Family meeting - family wants patient trach if she can't be
   extubated.
   -Continue Vanc/Meropenem to complete 10-day course.
   -Manage CHF and negative balance as goal today (goal -500) per day,
   yesterday -433 so got 10 IV lasix, will likely need IV lasix daily
   -suction PRN
   -MDI standing
   - with continued diuresis and improvement in secretions will attempt to
   wean off vent
   #CHF: Low EF (~15%) on carvedilol and lisinopril at home, which have
   been held. Carvedilol restarted yesterday at lower dose
   -Continue ASA
   - carvedilol 3.125
   - IV lasix
   - continue to hold lisinopril now in the context of low blood pressures
   - EKG from this AM - first degree AV block, PR interval 224 ms, wide
   QRS 122, left axis deviation, T wave inversion in V6, LBBB - these
   changes appear to be old (previous seen on EKG)
   #Decreased UOP: Responded to lasix 20IV x1, HD stable, gov 10 IV lasix
   yesterday.
   -consider repeat dose of lasix today to make goal urine output as above
   -Control BP (<140/90)
   # VAP: Continue to follow fever curve and WBC. Patient with GPC on BAL
   , on 10 day course of vanco, meropenem.
   -f/u cultures
   -trend WBC
   -vancomycin, meropenem (now [**5-11**])
   #DM: patient has been normoglycemic without need for insulin over
   several days.
   -restarted SSI for FS 200s
    #FEN: continue tube feeds per nutrition recommendations, free water
   bolus per Gtube (decrease today to 250 q8hrs), replete electrolytes as
   needed
   -kayexelate for rising K
    Access: PICC

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypothyroidism. She presented with respiratory failure and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient's family has discussed goals of care, including the possibility of intubation with the goal of extubation if successful. If extubation fails, they would like to proceed with tracheostomy. The patient was restarted on carvedilol for heart failure, initially on 6.25 mg and then reduced to 3.125 mg due to low blood pressure. Vancomycin levels were measured and found to be 21, so vancomycin was held. The patient received 10 IV Lasix yesterday evening for decreased urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period. Close monitoring of fever curve and white blood cell count is recommended. The patient has already been placed on antibiotics and active diuresis to manage this risk.
2. Chronic heart failure exacerbation: The patient's low ejection fraction (EF) of 15% indicates a higher risk for CHF exacerbation. Management includes continuing medications such as carvedilol and monitoring fluid balance. Diuretics may be necessary to manage fluid overload.
3. Decreased urine output"

   hypothyroidism presented with respiratory failure.
   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday family meeting to discuss goals of care. Attending was
   present for this meeting. As per family, would like to proceed with
   intubation with goal towards extubation. if patient fails extubation
   would like to have her proceed to trach. Patient restarted yesterday on
   carvedilol for heart failure, originally on 6.25 changed to 3.125 as
   dropped her pressure.  Vancomycin level yesterday was 21 so vanc was

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She presented with respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's family has agreed to intubation with the goal of eventual extubation. If extubation fails, they would like to proceed with tracheostomy. The patient is on multiple medications, including carvedilol for heart failure, and antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has also received IV lasix for decreased urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function and the possibility of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient's respiratory culture showed the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, which indicates a possible HAP. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics is crucial to prevent further complications.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) Exacerbation: The patient has a history of CHF, and her current condition may be exacerbated due to fluid overload or medication non-compliance. Monitoring and managing her fluid balance, along with optimizing her heart failure medications, is important to prevent further deterioration.

4. Decreased Urine Output: The patient's urine output needs to be closely monitored, as she received IV lasix to"

   Assessment and Plan
   #Respiratory failure: Most likely HAP and CHF exacerbation. Patient on
   antibiotics and active diursesis. Mental status has never been an issue
   for extubation, but her baseline is not-responsive. However, right now
   patient with copious secretions that could impair us from extubating
   her. Family meeting - family wants patient trach if she can't be
   extubated.
   -Continue Vanc/Meropenem to complete 10-day course.
   -Manage CHF and negative balance as goal today (goal -500) per day,
   yesterday -433 so got 10 IV lasix, will write for 20 IV lasix this AM
   and then check PM fluid balance
   -suction PRN
   -MDI standing
   - with continued diuresis and improvement in secretions will attempt to
   wean off vent
   #CHF: Low EF (~15%) on carvedilol and lisinopril at home, which have
   been held. Carvedilol restarted yesterday at lower dose
   -Continue ASA
   - carvedilol 3.125
   - IV lasix
   - continue to hold lisinopril now in the context of low blood pressures
   - EKG from this AM - first degree AV block, PR interval 224 ms, wide
   QRS 122, left axis deviation, T wave inversion in V6, LBBB - these
   changes appear to be old (previous seen on EKG)
   #Decreased UOP: Responded to lasix 20IV x1, HD stable, gov 10 IV lasix
   yesterday.
   -consider repeat dose of lasix today to make goal urine output as above
   -Control BP (<140/90)
   # VAP: Continue to follow fever curve and WBC. Patient with GPC on BAL
   , on 10 day course of vanco, meropenem.
   -f/u cultures
   -trend WBC
   -vancomycin, meropenem (now [**5-11**])
   #DM: patient has been normoglycemic without need for insulin over
   several days.
   -restarted SSI for FS 200s
    #FEN: continue tube feeds per nutrition recommendations, free water
   bolus per Gtube (decrease today to 250 q8hrs), replete electrolytes as
   needed
   -kayexelate for rising K

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. She presented with respiratory failure and is currently intubated in the ICU. The family has agreed to proceed with intubation with the goal of extubation, and if unsuccessful, tracheostomy. The patient is on multiple medications, including carvedilol for heart failure, which was restarted at a lower dose due to low blood pressure. Vancomycin levels were monitored, and the medication was held when it reached 21. The patient received IV lasix for decreased urine output. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a first-degree AV block. The patient's laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated lactate levels, low albumin, and abnormal liver function tests. The assessment suggests that the patient's respiratory failure is likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The plan includes continuing antibiotics, managing CHF, and attempting to wean off the ventilator once secretions improve. Other concerns include decreased urine output, hypertension, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) code status and will be kept in the ICU until extubated or until a tracheostomy is performed.

   I have examined the patient and reviewed the relevant history and
   labs.  I also was with the MICU team during the key portions of the
   services provided, and I agree with the note above, including its
   assessment and plan.  I would add and emphasize the following:
   Overnight she was stabe on the vent.  In fact all week she has needed
   only minimal vent support.  Son is visiting her again today. Coreg
   started.  IV Lasix given with increase in U.O.  Remains on Vanc and
   Meropenem

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p MI, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia) and CHF exacerbation. The patient's family wants to proceed with extubation if possible, and if unsuccessful, they consent to tracheostomy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if she is not successfully extubated.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of bilateral lower lobe opacities on the chest X-ray suggests bilateral pneumonias, which could lead to further respiratory complications.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's low ejection fraction (LVEF 25%) indicates a weakened heart, increasing the risk of heart failure exacerbation.
4. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's decreased urine output may indicate renal insufficiency, which could be exacerbated by medications or underlying conditions.
5. Infection: The presence of yeast in the urine culture may indicate a urinary tract infection, which could spread and cause systemic complications.
6. Dementia: The patient's history of dementia could affect her ability to respond appropriately after extubation.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and decreased venous return due to mechanical ventilation"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. She has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) on EKG and is receiving antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 116/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 50%. The patient's weight has increased from 55.7 kg at admission to 66.5 kg currently.

- Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
- Respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.24

The patient's respiratory cultures showed no microorganisms seen, but the oropharyngeal flora absent culture revealed Staphylococcus aureus coag positive, with 10,000-100,000 organisms/mL. The yeast count was approximately 1000/mL. 

The patient's plan includes continuing vancomycin and meropenem until the end of the 10-day course, managing congestive heart failure (CHF) with diuretics, suctioning per rectum as needed, and weaning off the ventilator if there is improvement in secretions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to HAP and CHF exacerbation. If the patient does not respond to treatment or if the secretions continue to be a problem, there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Infection: The patient has already shown evidence of bacterial infection with Staphylococcus aureus. There is a risk of developing additional infections, especially if the patient is immunocompromised or if proper infection control measures are not maintained.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's history of CHF and current management with diuretics indicate a risk of fluid overload. Monitoring fluid balance and adjusting diuretic dosages will be important to prevent fluid overload.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels need to be monitored closely, especially sodium, potassium"

   # Respiratory failure: Most likely [**3-4**] HAP MRSA and CHF exacerbation.
   Patient on antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) and active diursesis.
   Previously increased secretion and poor oxygenation have been issues
   preventing extubation. Family meeting - family wants patient trach if
   fails extubation. Would continue to wean and extubate today if
   possible.
   -Continue Vanc/Meropenem to complete 10-day course- stop on both [**10-22**]
   -Negative goal of 500cc/day on home dose 40mg lasix qd
   -suction PRN, MDI standing
   - with continued diuresis and improvement in secretions will attempt to
   extubate today. CPAP post-extubation if any issues ventilating.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old individual with a history of heart failure (HF) exacerbation and suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/56 to 135/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's weight has increased from 55.7 kg at admission to 66.5 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 570 mL and output of 1,391 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -821 mL. The patient's urine output has improved with the administration of IV lasix, with a current output of 313 mL. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 9.8 to 13.6 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, creatinine level of 1.0-1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose levels fluctuating between 78-241 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including potassium (K+) levels between 3.4-4"

   respiratory failure now showing some good response and capacity for
   tolerance of diuresis.  Her initial presentation was one of decreased
   responsivness and diaphoresis.  Suspiscion has been for possible
   infectious insult leading to respiratory decompensation in the setting
   of known history of imparied cardiac function.
   Respiratory Failure--Patient now with prolonged ventilatory support for
   12 days and has PSV wean completed.  She has failed extubation x1 in
   past
this was in setting of volume overload and evlolution of VAP.
   Both of these insults seem to have dimished or improved.  This morning
   patient with minimal response to verbal commands but reassuring has had
   cuff leak documented on exam this morning.  CXR shows some persistence
   of left lower lobe consolidation.  Favorable predictors are Ve<10,
   RR<25, no new insult.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's initial presentation included decreased responsiveness and diaphoresis, leading to suspicion of an infectious insult causing respiratory decompensation in the setting of known impaired cardiac function.

The patient has been on prolonged ventilatory support for 12 days, with a recent attempt at extubation that failed due to volume overload and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Currently, the patient is showing minimal response to verbal commands but does have a documented cuff leak on examination. A chest X-ray shows persistence of left lower lobe consolidation.

The plan moving forward includes:
- Extubation in the morning
- Continuing antibiotic therapy (vancomycin and meropenem) until October 22nd for a 10-day course for VAP
- Maintaining a negative fluid balance
- Transitioning to CPAP support rapidly post-extubation, with management of edema
- Considering a tracheostomy for long-term support if reintubation is needed

The patient also has a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, for which she is receiving medications such as Coreg, Lasix, and spironolactone. Good rate-pressure product control will be important during extubation.

Additionally, the patient has been experiencing diarrhea, and a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of non-responsiveness. He was previously intubated but extubated yesterday morning and is currently on a shovel mask with 5L O2, maintaining an oxygen saturation of 94-98%. The patient has been experiencing periods of apnea and desaturation into the high 70s, which resolve on their own. Vital signs include a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 115/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 36.3 C. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals wheezes on lung auscultation, mild muscle wasting, and no spontaneous movement. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) MRSA and congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. Antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem) have been initiated, and diuresis is being continued. The family prefers the patient to have a tracheostomy if extubation fails. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen if there is a delay in treating the suspected HAP MRSA or if the CHF exacerbation progresses.

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a chief complaint of non-responsiveness. She has a history of pneumonia, severe systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient was extubated yesterday morning and is now on a shovel mask with 5L O2, maintaining an oxygen saturation of 94-98%. She has been clearing her throat and coughing occasionally but appears comfortable with vital signs of 120/80s, 80s. The patient has had periods of apnea and desaturation into the high 70s, which resolve on their own, during which her hemodynamics remain stable. She was written for 20mg IV lasix at 5am.

The patient has no known drug allergies. She has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, meropenem, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and furosemide. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information. The patient's weight has increased from 55.7 kg at admission to 66.5 kg currently. Her urine output has been low at 1.1 L yesterday.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin T levels, but otherwise within normal limits. Imaging studies are mentioned but not explicitly described"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, was admitted with respiratory failure. She has successfully been extubated without any complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/59 to 127/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. She has a left bundle branch block and has gained weight since admission, now weighing 66.5 kg compared to her admission weight of 55.7 kg. 

The patient is receiving various medications including furosemide, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and prophylactic antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem). Her fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a total intake of 940 mL and output of 1113 mL since 12 AM. The patient is on invasive ventilation support, using a face tent to deliver oxygen, and her ABG results indicate hypoxemia. 

Her lab results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, but there are some abnormalities in her kidney function tests (creatinine) and electrolyte levels (potassium, sodium). Her glucose levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 78 to 241 mg/dL. Other lab values such as liver enzymes, cardiac markers, and blood gases are"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient with HAP MRSA on admission,
   exacerbating significant systolic/diastolic CHF. Patient initially
   improved with diuresis however now not responding as well. Overnight
   she no longer had apneic periods but will desat with even minimal
   movement. FIO2 increased to 80% to maintain sats in low 90s. This is
   likely secondary to her LL collapse [**3-4**] mucus plugging, which could be
   intervened during bronchoscopy.
   CT chest shows
   Increased bilateral pleural effusions, now moderate on the right and
   large
   on the left.
   2. Almost complete collapse of the left lung with obstruction of left
   main
   stem bronchus and both lobar bronchi, probably due to secretions.
   Consider
   therapeutic bronchoscopy.
   3. Right lung ground-glass opacity, probably due to expiratory phase of
   respiration, although a component of hydrostatic edema is possible.
   4. Increased ascites and diffuse anasarca.
   5. Excessive tracheal collapsibility, suggesting tracheomalacia, but
   incompletely evaluated.
   6. Cardiomegaly. Atherosclerotic calcifications.
   7. Osteopenia.
   8. Unchanged 1-cm nodule adjacent to the spleen, nonspecific.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU with a history of HAP MRSA, exacerbating significant systolic/diastolic CHF. The patient initially improved with diuresis but is now not responding as well. She experiences desaturation with minimal movement and has apneic periods. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/73 to 133/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on high flow nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (13.3 K/uL), slightly decreased hemoglobin level (11.7 g/dL), normal sodium (142 mg/dL), slightly elevated potassium (4.2 mEq/L), moderately elevated blood urea nitrogen (43 mg/dL), and slightly elevated creatinine (1.2 mg/dL). Other lab values indicate elevated troponin-T levels, decreased platelet count (265 K/uL), and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's imaging studies reveal increased bilateral pleural effusions, almost complete collapse of the left lung with obstruction of the left main stem bronchus and both lobar bronchi, ground-glass opacity in the right lung, increased ascites, diffuse anasarca"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension, oliguria, and acute kidney injury. He has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On admission, he was hypotensive and oliguric with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. He required aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors for blood pressure control. Despite this, he continued to have persistent hypotension and oliguria, leading to the diagnosis of acute kidney injury. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and cardiac dysfunction evidenced by left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient also has elevated pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) levels, which suggest cardiac stress. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing severe sepsis with positive blood cultures for both vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRPA). He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, as well as antifungal therapy with caspofungin. Despite these interventions, the patient's condition remains critical, and he continues to require aggressive management in the ICU."

   # Respiratory failure:  Patient with HAP MRSA on admission,
   exacerbating significant systolic/diastolic CHF. Patient initially
   improved with diuresis however now not responding as well. Overnight
   she no longer had apneic periods but will desat with even minimal
   movement. FIO2 increased to 80% to maintain sats in low 90s. This is
   likely secondary to her LL collapse [**3-4**] mucus plugging, which could be
   relieved w/nasal suctioning, chest PT and bronchoscopy.
   CT chest shows
   Increased bilateral pleural effusions, now moderate on the right and
   large
   on the left.
   2. Almost complete collapse of the left lung with obstruction of left
   main
   stem bronchus and both lobar bronchi, probably due to secretions.
   Consider
   therapeutic bronchoscopy.
   3. Right lung ground-glass opacity, probably due to expiratory phase of
   respiration, although a component of hydrostatic edema is possible.
   4. Increased ascites and diffuse anasarca.
   5. Excessive tracheal collapsibility, suggesting tracheomalacia, but
   incompletely evaluated.
   6. Cardiomegaly. Atherosclerotic calcifications.
   7. Osteopenia.
   8. Unchanged 1-cm nodule adjacent to the spleen, nonspecific.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has a history of HAP MRSA, exacerbating significant systolic/diastolic CHF. The patient initially improved with diuretics but is now not responding well. She experiences desaturation with minimal movement and has an increased need for supplemental oxygen. The CT chest shows increased bilateral pleural effusions, collapse of the left lung with obstruction of the left main stem bronchus, ground-glass opacity in the right lung, increased ascites, diffuse anasarca, excessive tracheal collapsibility, cardiomegaly, atherosclerotic calcifications, osteopenia, and a 1-cm nodule adjacent to the spleen. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support. The patient has several medical conditions including respiratory failure, CHF, diarrhea, decreased urine output, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to mucus plugging and lung collapse. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the mucus plugging is not effectively managed.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's systolic/diastolic CHF may lead to cardiogenic shock, especially if the heart function continues to deteriorate.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of HAP"

   improved with diuresis and yesterday improved with deep suctioning as
   had evidence of ll collapse secondary to mucus plugging. oxygenation
   improved yesterday, now on NC  likely.  Decided to hold on therapeutic
   bronch and continue with aggressive chest pt and suctioning.
   CT chest shows Increased bilateral pleural effusions, now moderate on
   the right and large on the left 2. Almost complete collapse of the left
   lung with obstruction of left main stem bronchus and both lobar
   bronchi, probably due to secretions.  3. Right lung ground-glass
   opacity, probably due to expiratory phase ofrespiration, although a
   component of hydrostatic edema is possible. 4. Increased ascites and
   diffuse anasarca. 5. Excessive tracheal collapsibility, suggesting
   tracheomalacia, but
   incompletely evaluated.
    6. Cardiomegaly. Atherosclerotic calcifications.
    7. Osteopenia.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient with HAP MRSA on admission,
   exacerbating significant systolic/diastolic CHF. Patient initially
   improved with diuresis and yesterday improved with deep suctioning as
   had evidence of lung collapse secondary to mucus plugging. oxygenation
   improved yesterday, now on NC only.  Decided to hold on therapeutic
   bronch and continue with aggressive chest pt and suctioning. CT chest
   shows Increased bilateral pleural effusions, now moderate on the right
   and large on the left, however suspect that a large component of this
   may be secondary to lung collapse from secretions. 2. Almost complete
   collapse of the left lung with obstruction of left main stem bronchus
   and both lobar bronchi, probably due to secretions.  3. Right lung
   ground-glass opacity, probably due to expiratory phase ofrespiration,
   although a component of hydrostatic edema is possible. 4. Increased
   ascites and diffuse anasarca. 5. Excessive tracheal collapsibility,
   suggesting tracheomalacia, but
    incompletely evaluated.
    6. Cardiomegaly. Atherosclerotic calcifications.
    7. Osteopenia.
    8. Unchanged 1-cm nodule adjacent to the spleen, nonspecific.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, MI, hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and essentially no mental status. She presents with respiratory distress and has been intubated and extubated twice. She is currently on oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient's 24-hour events include being planned for bronch but instead received deep suctioning. The initial goal was to diurese the patient with a goal of -1 L, but the patient looked dry so additional diuresis was held off despite being positive. The patient showed improved oxygenation after suctioning.

The patient has a history of no known drug allergies and received meropenem antibiotics on [**2113-10-19**] 08:38 PM. She is also on furosemide (Lasix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal limits, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) and has gained weight since admission.

Physical examination reveals general appearance as well-nourished with no acute distress. Eyes/conjunctiva show adduction of OD. Cardiovascular examination shows normal PMI, S1, and S2 sounds. Peripheral vascular examination indicates present radial and dorsalis pedis pulses on both sides. Respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 382**] yo female admit to ICU with acute, hypoxemic respiratory failure
   with source likely multifactorial with pleural effusion, aspiration and
   multilobar pneumonia and collapse continuing.  She has had good
   response to supportive care with chest PT and suctioning which is
   encouraging.  The open question has been as to what extent patient is
   volume overload and in need of diuresis.  At this time she has been
   able to be weaned down on supplemental oxygen to nasal cannula.
   1)Respiratory Failure Acute-
   -Lasix 40mg/d to keep mild negative fluid balance
   -Meropenem completed
   -Full chest PT and suctioning to maintain open airways and secreation
   clearance is essential.
   2)Congestive Heart Failure-
   -Carvedilol
   -Spironolactone
   -ASA
   -Up titration of treatment here will be necessary but not sufficient to
   keep respiratory status stable.

","The patient is a 91-year-old female admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The source of the respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including pleural effusion, aspiration, and multilobar pneumonia with collapse. The patient has responded well to supportive care, including chest physical therapy (PT) and suctioning.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/70 to 129/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) heart rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 66.5 kg, with an admission weight of 63.9 kg.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,401 mL and a total output of 780 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 621 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and others.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count ranging from 8.7 to 13.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level ranging from 34.8% to 39.9%, platelet count ranging from 61 to 145 K/uL, creatinine level ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 mg/dL, troponin T level ranging from 0.02 to 0.03 mg/dL, glucose level ranging from 86 to 172 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range.

Imaging shows improved aeration bilaterally. The patient's assessment and plan include acute respiratory failure with a likely multifactorial source, as well as congestive heart failure. The patient is currently on Lasix 40mg/d to maintain a mild negative fluid balance, and chest PT and suctioning are essential for maintaining open airways and secretion clearance. The patient's congestive heart failure will require up titration of treatment, including carvedilol, spironolactone, and ASA.

The patient is on full nutrition with fiber and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has a PICC line in place and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is to be transferred to the floor."
