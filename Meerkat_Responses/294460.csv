   Assessment and Plan
   24 year old woman with Lupus and ESRD on HD (MWF) presents with fever
   after dialysis.
   # Fever, tachycardia, relative leukocytosis and hypotension: SIRS with
   likely sepsis. Source includes GI source (nausea vomiting) vs dialysis
   line (although no skin changes) vs thrombophlebitis. Inflammatory rx in
   setting of SLE possible. WBCs trending down. Defevresced. SBP in 90-100
   with IVFs.
   - Head CT/.sinus CT: negative
   - continue empiric dapto and gent
   - follow bcx; IJ line cx
   - consider LUE US r/o expanding clot and/or CT LUE r/o infected clot if
   fever persists.
   - consider TTE r/o CN endocarditis given recurrent fever.
   - d/w renal re: reinitiation of SLE rx
   # Sinus tachycardia: driven by decreassed circulatory volume vs pain vs
   infection/inflammation. Improved with IVF and pain mngmt.
   - monitor, prn IVF/analgesia
   - d/w renal re antiinflamatory agents
   # HA: mild and improve with acetaminophen. No meningeal finidings on
   exam. MS intact. Head CT negative. (Meningitis was considered but felt
   it was unlikely beause: intermittent nature of fever, absence of
   meningeal signs or mental status change, associated findings of nausea
   and vomiting are not new for pt).
   - monitor
   - if AMS or worsened HA or recurrent fever or worsening WBcs consider
   LP although already on abx.
   # ESRD on HD (MWF): Cre 8.2. Likely [**1-2**] SLE but equivocal biopsy as
   noted above. On transplant list.
   - continue HD
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1205**], C3, C4
   # SLE: associated with leukoppenia, arthritis, s/p pericardial
   effusion. Off immunosuppressants for three months.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 24-year-old woman with Lupus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presents with fever after dialysis. She has been diagnosed with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and likely sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, with possibilities including a gastrointestinal source, dialysis line infection, or thrombophlebitis. There are also concerns about an inflammatory reaction in the setting of her systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, which may be driven by decreased circulatory volume, pain, or infection/inflammation. Her laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's fever has resolved, and her white blood cell count is trending down. She is being treated empirically with antibiotics and her central line cultures are pending. Further considerations include a lung ultrasound to rule out expanding clot and/or computed tomography (CT) to rule out infected clot if the fever persists. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) is also being considered to rule out infective endocarditis given recurrent fever.

The patient's sinus tachycardia is being managed with intravenous fluids (IVF) and pain management. Her headache is mild and improving with acetaminophen. There are no findings of meningitis on examination, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old woman with Lupus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) presenting with fever after dialysis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 89/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has a history of Lupus and ESRD, and she is currently on HD three times a week. She presents with fever, tachycardia, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension. Blood cultures have been negative, and the patient's nausea and vomiting have resolved. 

The assessment suggests that the patient may have an inflammatory reaction related to her Lupus rather than sepsis. The patient's fever and sinus tachycardia have improved with intravenous fluids (IVFs) and pain management. The patient's headache has also improved but continues to be present. 

Considering the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection/inflammation: The patient's fever, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension initially raised concerns for sepsis. Although blood cultures have been negative, the presence of fever and relative leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing inflammatory process, possibly related to her Lupus."

   Assessment and Plan
   24 year old woman with Lupus and ESRD on HD (MWF) presents with fever
   after dialysis.
   # Fever, tachycardia, relative leukocytosis and hypotension: Initially
   thought to be SIRS with likely sepsis, however blood cultures have been
   negative and N/V has resolved.  More likely [**1-2**] inflammatory rx in
   setting of SLE.  She has a low-grade temp and SBP is back to normal
   range of 90-100 with IVFs.  CT head and sinus were negative
   - Consider imagine left arm U/S to evaluate for clot
   - Consider TTE to r/o culture-negative endocarditis
   - Start Prednisone 20 mg daily
   - Consider Rheum C/S tomorrow
   - Continue empiric dapto and gent
   - follow bcx; IJ line cx
   # Sinus tachycardia: driven by decreased circulatory volume vs pain vs
   infection/inflammation. Improved with IVF and pain mngmt.
   - monitor, prn IVF/analgesia
   - d/w renal re antiinflamatory agents
   # HA: She continues to have HA this morning, but it is improved from
   yesterday.  CT head/sinus negative.  No meningeal finidings on exam. MS
   intact.  (Meningitis was considered but felt it was unlikely beause:
   intermittent nature of fever, absence of meningeal signs or mental
   status change, associated findings of nausea and vomiting are not new
   for pt).
   - Continue Oxycodone and Tylenol prn for pain
   - Start Prednisone today
   - if AMS or worsened HA or recurrent fever or worsening WBcs consider
   LP although already on abx.
   # ESRD on HD (MWF): Cre 8.2. Likely [**1-2**] SLE but equivocal biopsy as
   noted above. On transplant list.

","The patient is a 24-year-old woman with Lupus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presents with fever after dialysis. The initial assessment suggested sepsis, but blood cultures have been negative, and symptoms such as nausea and vomiting have resolved. It is more likely that the patient has an inflammatory response related to her Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The low-grade temperature and stable blood pressure have improved with intravenous fluids (IVFs). A CT scan of the head and sinuses was negative, ruling out sinusitis as the cause of the fever. 

The patient also has sinus tachycardia, which is likely due to decreased circulatory volume, pain, or infection/inflammation. The heart rate has improved with IVF and pain management. 

Furthermore, the patient continues to experience headaches, which have improved from the previous day. A CT scan of the head and sinuses was negative, and there are no signs of meningitis on examination. 

In terms of ongoing management, the patient will continue to receive oxycodone and Tylenol as needed for pain relief, and Prednisone will be started today. If the patient develops altered mental status or worsening headache, a lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered, although she is already on antibiotics.

Regarding her ESRD on HD, her creatinine level is 8.2, and she is likely to have SLE. She is currently on the transplant list. She will continue with regular HD sessions.

The patient's medical history includes leukopenia, arthritis, and a previous pericardial effusion. She has been off immunosuppressants for three months. She will start Prednisone at a dose of 20 mg daily, and a consultation with rheumatology is planned for tomorrow.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving regular diet and IVFs. Her glycemic control is managed with a HISS (likely referring to a specific protocol or medication). Her lines include a dialysis catheter inserted on 07/22/2119 at 09:16 AM. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided. There are no specific comments or additional information provided. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be kept in the ICU for now."

 HEADACHE
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   24 yr old with lupus, ESKD on HD via tunneled catheter, fever, emesis,
   headach vs lightheadedness and presented with tachycardia,
   leukocytosis/left shift and hypotension with SBP in 80s. Suspect
   SIRS/sepsis with no obvious source of infection though left arm
   thrombus remains possible. Gastroenteritis, line sepsis less likely.
   Meningitis being considered though had mild headache that resolves with
   tylenol and no physical signs of meningitis. High index of suspicion
   that her Lupus is active considering that these episodes of fever
   appear to have started following discontinuing prednisone. C3/C4
   pending. Will empirically start pred 20 mg daily.
   Hypotension has improved back to baseline. She is immunosuppressed with
   underlying SLE with no steroids or antiinflammatories x 3 months.
   Continue broad spectrum Abx and f/u on multiple blood cultures. Send
   stool for cdiff and culture. Will ultrasound left arm tomorrow looking
   again for abscess. Hold off on TEE for now. Will likely involve
   rheumatology tomorrow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with lupus and end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis through a tunneled catheter. She presented with fever, emesis, headache versus light-headedness, tachycardia, leukocytosis with a left shift, and hypotension with a blood pressure in the 80s. The patient is suspected to have sepsis without organ dysfunction, potentially secondary to an infected dialysis catheter or another source of infection. Other considerations include gastroenteritis, line sepsis, or meningitis. The patient's lupus is believed to be active, given the episodes of fever starting after discontinuing prednisone. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and multiple blood cultures have been sent for testing. Stool cultures and tests for Clostridium difficile infection have also been ordered. An ultrasound of the left arm will be performed tomorrow to look for an abscess. The patient is immunosuppressed with underlying SLE and no steroids or anti-inflammatories for the past three months. The plan involves consulting rheumatology tomorrow and continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is currently receiving full diet nutrition with glycemic control using Humalog insulin sliding scale. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous UF Heparin and stress ulcer prevention with PPI. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition remains in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of lupus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. She presented with fever after dialysis, and her initial assessment suggested sepsis due to fever, tachycardia, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension. However, blood cultures were negative, and her nausea and vomiting resolved. The patient's temperature is now low-grade, and her systolic blood pressure (SBP) is within the normal range with intravenous fluids (IVFs). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head and sinuses was negative.

The patient's sinus tachycardia is likely due to decreased circulatory volume, pain, or infection/inflammation. It has improved with IVF and pain management. The patient's ESRD on HD is likely secondary to lupus nephritis, but the renal biopsy results are equivocal. She is on the transplant list.

The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) associated with leukopenia, arthritis, and a previous pericardial effusion. She has been off immunosuppressants for three months. Prednisone therapy has been initiated, and follow-up with a rheumatologist is planned.

- The patient's fever, tachycardia, relative leukocytosis, and hypotension initially suggested sepsis, but blood cultures have been negative.
- Other potential causes of the fever, such as sinusitis or urinary tract infection, have been ruled out with negative CT head and sinus results.
- The patient's symptoms may be attributed to an inflammatory reaction in the setting of SLE.
- Prednisone has been started to manage the inflammatory response.
- Rheumatology consultation has been requested for further evaluation.
- The patient's sinus tachycardia is likely driven by decreased circulatory volume, pain, or infection/inflammation. IV fluids and pain management have improved the condition.
- The patient continues to experience headaches, which are improved from yesterday. CT head/sinus was negative, and there are no meningeal findings on examination. Meningitis is considered unlikely due to intermittent fever, absence of meningeal signs, and lack of mental status change.
- Pain management with Oxycodone and"

   24F with SLE and ESRD on HD (MWF) presents with fever after dialysis,
   with presumed infected fistula. Of note, pt has a recent history of
   recurrent fever that resolved with steroids. Since admission, she has
   been on abx, and yesterday was started on steroids. Her bp and temps
   have been normal. The etiology of the fevers and transient hypotension
   is concerning for sirs/sepsis, although no source has been identified.
   Will wait to hear from rheumatology whether SLE flare could explain the

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 24-year-old female with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (MWF). She presents with fever after dialysis, with presumed infected fistula.
- She has a recent history of recurrent fevers that resolved with steroids.
- On admission, she was started on antibiotics and steroids.
- Her blood pressure and temperature have been normal, but there is concern for sepsis without organ dysfunction.
- The source of the fevers and transient hypotension is unclear, but it could be due to SLE flare or sepsis.
- The patient appears significantly better today and is stable to be transferred to the floor with ongoing work-up of her recent acute on subacute symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of fever, recurrent fevers, and transient hypotension raises concern for sepsis. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications if not promptly treated.
2. Infected Fistula: The patient's presumed infected fistula increases the risk of local infection and bacteremia, which can contribute to systemic infection and sepsis.
3. SLE Flare: The patient's history of SLE and the presence of fever and hypotension may suggest a potential SLE flare. Flares can result in various complications such as renal involvement, cardiovascular problems"
