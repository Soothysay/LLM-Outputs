   79M with h/o dementia presents with sepsis, PNA, hypovolemia and severe
   metabolic derangements.
   #. Shock: with components of Sepsis and hypovolmia. Has known lingular
   PNA as one source of infection.  Sepsis and dehydration are likely
   contributing to his remarkably elevated lactate, however, given his
   guaic + stool and abdominal pain, mesenteric ischemia is also on the
   differential diagnosis; he has a h/o rectal abscess as well.
   -received levo/ceftriaxone in ED; continue levo/flagyl/vanco (renal

   #. Hypernatremia- likely hypovolemic; free water deficit = 5.6 liters.
   Goal to lower by 0.5 meq/L per hour and no more than by 12 meq/L in the
   first 24 hours for a goal of no lower than 146 tomorrow afternoon.  CVP
   currently = 4, so needs volume resucitation as well, though need to
   carefully monitor respiratory status.

   Communication: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds , ICU
   Code status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia who presented with sepsis, pneumonia (PNA), hypovolemia, and severe metabolic derangements. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including shock, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury (ARF), leukocytosis, decub ulcers, anemia, elevated troponin levels, hypothyroidism, and agitation. The patient's current medications include levothyroxine, seroquel, heparin, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient has a history of rectal abscess and abdominal pain, which raises the possibility of mesenteric ischemia. This condition can lead to bowel infarction and necrosis if not promptly treated.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's dementia and risk of aspiration, there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia. This can result in respiratory distress and septicemia.
3. Decubitus ulcers: The presence of sacral and heel ulcers indicates pressure injuries. If not properly managed, these ulcers can worsen and lead to infection or deeper tissue damage.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest ARF. If not addressed, this condition can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dial"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia who presented with sepsis, pneumonia (PNA), hypovolemia, and severe metabolic derangements. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient is currently in shock due to a combination of sepsis and hypovolemia. This requires immediate management with aggressive volume resuscitation.

2. Mesenteric ischemia: Given the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain and positive guaiac test indicating possible bleeding, mesenteric ischemia should be considered as a differential diagnosis. This requires further evaluation and monitoring.

3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a high risk for aspiration pneumonia due to his dementia and the use of tube feeds. This should be taken into consideration when choosing antibiotics.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 153. It is important to lower the sodium level gradually by no more than 0.5 mEq/L per hour and not below 146 within the first 24 hours.

5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 1.1, which is likely prerenal in the setting of profound dehydration. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is needed to treat the AKI.

6. Acid-base disturbance: The patient's recent ABG results indicate a triple disturbance with profound metabolic"

   79M with h/o dementia presents with hypovolemic and septic shock, PNA,
   and severe metabolic derangements.
   #. Shock: hypovolemic and septic.  Markedly better this am with
   aggressive volume resuscitation overnight (positive ~8L today) and
   broad spectrum abx. Abdominal exam this am is WNL which makes
   mesenteric ischemia or intrabdominal source of infection much less
   likely.   Hemodynamics markedly improved this am.
   -continue levo/flagyl; received 1 dose of vanco
would check level
   tomorrow.

   -consider narrowing abx tomorrow, pending culture data received
   levo/ceftriaxone in ED; continue levo/flagyl/vanco (renal dose)-
   -Serial abd exams
   #. Hypernatremia- likely hypovolemic; free water deficit = 5.6 liters
   on admission. Goal to lower by 0.5 meq/L per hour and no more than by
   12 meq/L in the first 24 hours for a goal of no lower than 146 this
   afternoon.  Improving with D5W.
   -continue D5W at 125 cc/hr
   -serial lytes (q4-6h); adjust IVF rates based on response.
   -transfusing 1u PRBCs this am for volume and anemia
   -consider NGT for tube feeds later today (need to discuss w/ daughter)
   #acid base: had triple disturbance on admit (met alk, met acid, resp
   acid)--- all improveing with volume and abx.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia, who presented with hypovolemic and septic shock, pneumonia (PNA), and severe metabolic derangements. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable after aggressive volume resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's condition is improving, with better hemodynamics, resolution of abdominal exam abnormalities, and improvement in hypernatremia. He has anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated troponin levels, which are being closely monitored. The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism, depression, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with hypovolemic and septic shock. Although his condition is currently stable, there is a risk of recurrence if adequate fluid resuscitation and antibiotics are not maintained.
2. Infection: The patient has pneumonia (PNA), and there is a risk of developing new infections or complications related to his current infection, such as sepsis or organ failure.
3. Metabolic Derangements: The patient has severe metabolic derangements, including hypernatremia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and altered mental status. Close monitoring and careful management are required to prevent further complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require transfusion support. Avoiding systemic anticoagulation is crucial to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old man with a history of dementia and Crohn's disease who presented with hypovolemic and septic shock, along with high lactate levels and pneumonia. The patient has been receiving volume resuscitation and antibiotics for septic shock, and there has been improvement in his condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Shock: The patient initially presented with both hypovolemic and septic shock. Although his condition is improving after volume resuscitation, there is still a risk of recurrence or worsening of shock if adequate fluid replacement is not maintained.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient initially had hypernatremia, with a free water deficit of approximately 6 liters. The plan is to continue repleting with D5W, but close monitoring of serum sodium levels will be necessary to avoid rapid changes in electrolyte balance.

3. Elevated Lactate: The patient had elevated lactate levels, which improved after initiating treatment for sepsis. However, ongoing monitoring is required to ensure that lactate levels remain within normal range and do not indicate recurrent or persistent tissue hypoperfusion.

4. Elevated Troponin: The patient had elevated troponin levels, which are indicative of cardiac damage. Although the levels are improving, further cardiac evaluation may be necessary to rule out any myocardial injury.

5. Renal Failure: The patient initially had signs of renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old man with a history of dementia and Crohn's disease who presented with hypovolemic and septic shock, high lactate levels, and pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU receiving treatment for these conditions. His vital signs are stable, with improved fluid balance and oxygenation. He is receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. His labs show improvement in renal function, but there are concerns about potential complications such as hypernatremia, elevated lactate, and troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with both hypovolemic and septic shock. Although his condition is improving after volume resuscitation, ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure his hemodynamic stability.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can lead to neurological complications if not corrected properly.
3. Elevated Lactate: The patient's lactate levels are still elevated, suggesting ongoing tissue hypoperfusion. This may indicate ongoing sepsis or a bowel source of infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.
4. Elevated Troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating potential cardiac damage. While they are improving, further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of cardiac involvement.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has shown improvement,"

   Assessment and Plan
   79M with h/o dementia present with primary hypovolemic shock, also with
   PNA now improving with fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.
   #. Shock: hypovolemic and septic.  Markedly improved with aggressive
   volume resuscitation overnight and broad spectrum abx. Initially had
   concern for abdominal source of infection, so on flagyl in addition to
   vanc/levo but abdominal exam unremarkable. Remains hemodynamically
   stable.
   - fluid boluses prn to keep MAP>60
   - continue vanc/levofloxacin for coverage of PNA, but discontinue
   flagyl
   - f/u BCx
   # PNA: Patient with continued RML/RLL infiltrate. On vanc/levo/flagyl.
   WBC improving, Afebrile overnight. Cultures without any growth but
   sputum sample from [**10-12**] with contamination
   - continue vanco/levo
   - resend sputum culture, and tailure abx to culture data
   - aggressive suctioning
   - follow daily CXR for now
   #. Hypernatremia- likely hypovolemic. Improved with free water boluses
   and D5W
   - can discontinue D5W and decrease free water boluses
   - continue to trend Na
   #. ARF: baseline Cr = 1.1, likely prerenal in setting of profound
   dehydration.  Has been decreasing with fluids, still not back at
   baseline
   - boluses prn
   - start tube feeds for fluid and nutrition
   - redoes antibiotics for renal function
   .

   appropriately from 21 to 24
   -avoid systemic anticoagulation
   -continue Fe supplementation
   - trend [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfuse for <21 or brisk bleeding
   # Elevated troponin- Ck normal, no ekg changes. trop likely elevated in
   setting of ARF as well as perhaps component of demand ischemia in
   setting of tachycardia and shock.   Trended down with repeat check.

He has been improving with aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is afebrile. His WBC count is improving, and he has a continued right middle/lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. His sodium levels are corrected, and his renal function is improving. He has decubitus ulcers, anemia, and elevated troponin levels. The patient has chronic issues such as depression, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. His nutrition plan includes tube feeds, and he is receiving prophylactic heparin and a proton pump inhibitor. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a continued right middle/lower lobe infiltrate, indicating ongoing pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and possible progression to respiratory failure if not adequately treated.
2. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has sacral and bilateral heel ulcers, which can become infected and worsen if not properly managed with wound care and pressure relief measures.
3. Anemia: The patient's baseline Hct is 26-28, and it has decreased to 24.5. He is at risk for further deterioration in"

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia and dehydration. The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) and has shown improvement in renal function. A nasogastric tube (NGT) has been placed, and the patient started on tube feeding (TF) and home medications. The patient received a blood transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.7°C, current temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/50 mmHg to 126/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

Fluid balance shows an input of 5,645 mL, with 1,893 mL being IVF, 68 mL through TF, and 375 mL of blood products. The total output is 1,855 mL, including 490 mL of urine. The respiratory support shows an oxygen saturation of 96% and ABG results of pH 7.49, PaCO2 26 mmHg, and HCO3- 31 mEq/L.

   79M with h/o dementia presents with hypovolemic and septic shock, PNA,
   and severe metabolic derangements.
   #. Shock: hypovolemic and septic.  Markedly better this am with
   aggressive volume resuscitation overnight (positive ~8L today) and
   broad spectrum abx. Abdominal exam this am is WNL which makes
   mesenteric ischemia or intrabdominal source of infection much less
   likely.   Hemodynamics markedly improved this am.
   -continue levo/flagyl; received 1 dose of vanco
would check level
   tomorrow.
   -f/u blood, sputum, urine, stool cultures
   -consider narrowing abx tomorrow, pending culture data received
   levo/ceftriaxone in ED; continue levo/flagyl/vanco (renal dose)-
   -Serial abd exams
   #. Hypernatremia- likely hypovolemic; free water deficit = 5.6 liters
   on admission. Goal to lower by 0.5 meq/L per hour and no more than by
   12 meq/L in the first 24 hours for a goal of no lower than 146 this
   afternoon.  Improving with D5W.
   -continue D5W at 125 cc/hr
   -serial lytes (q4-6h); adjust IVF rates based on response.
   -transfusing 1u PRBCs this am for volume and anemia
   -consider NGT for tube feeds later today (need to discuss w/ daughter)
   #acid base: had triple disturbance on admit (met alk, met acid, resp
   acid)--- all improveing with volume and abx.
   .
   #. ARF: baseline Cr = 1.1, likely prerenal in setting of profound
   dehydration.
   -improving with aggressive fluid resuscitation
   -trend
   -avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #
   # Leukocytosis- baseline WBC's 15, chose not to work up as outpt.
   Current elevation [**3-4**] PNA/sepsis
   -trend
   -f/u sputum, stool, blood, urine cultures
   .
   #Decub ulcers: sacral and b/l heel ulcers
   -wound care
   -Kinair bed
   #Anemia- baseline Hct 26-28, currently 24.5 (from 34.6 on admit with
   5LNS).  Pt is guaic +.
   -avoid systemic anticoagulation
   -transfuse 1 unit PRBCs this am
   -resume iron when taking po's or if NGT placed
   # Elevated troponin- Ck normal, no ekg changes. trop likely elevated in
   setting of ARF as well as perhaps component of demand ischemia in
   setting of tachycardia and shock.   Trended down with repeat check.
   #hypothyroid- continue levothyroxine
   #dementia/agitation- continue seroquel
   #Chronic issues: Include depression, htn, hyperlipidemia:
   -holding SSRI, antihypertensives, vitamins, statin, diuretics in
   setting of shock/inability to take PO.
   -Will need to add these meds on as able as pt stabilizes or when NGT

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia and Crohn's disease presenting with hypovolemic and septic shock, high lactate levels, and pneumonia. He has been diagnosed with several medical complications including shock, hypernatremia, and renal failure. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
- Heart rate: 112 bpm (with a baseline of 93-112 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 105/56 mmHg (with a baseline of 67-126/45-70 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (with a baseline of 12-33 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on nasal cannula with FiO2 at 3L

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (28.8 K/uL), decreased hematocrit (24.5%), and platelet count (463). His electrolyte levels are also abnormal with elevated sodium (150 mg/dL), potassium (4.6 mEq/L), and chloride (109 mEq/L). The patient's renal function is improving, as indicated by decreasing creatinine levels.

Imaging shows bilateral lower lobe infiltrates and interstitial edema on chest X-ray. Microbiology tests are pending.

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia and Crohn's disease who presented with hypovolemic and septic shock, high lactate levels, and pneumonia. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently showing signs of improvement in terms of volume status, metabolic disarray, and renal function. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Persistent septic shock: Despite the current improvement, there is still a risk of recurrent or persistent septic shock due to the ongoing infection and weakened immune system.

2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's kidneys and liver are still at risk of further dysfunction, which could lead to chronic kidney disease or liver failure.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can potentially worsen if not adequately treated, leading to respiratory failure.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and underlying conditions can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which can be a serious complication.

5. Delirium: The patient's dementia and recent ICU stay make him susceptible to delirium, which can impair cognitive function and prolong recovery time.

6. Infection control: Given the patient's NG tube and recent antibiotic use, there is a risk of healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

7. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers,"

   Assessment and Plan
   79M with h/o dementia present with primary hypovolemic shock, also with
   PNA now improving with fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.
   #. Hypovolemic Shock: Resolved.  Likely due in large part to poor PO
   intake at home
currently with NGT in place
   - fluid boluses prn to keep MAP>60
   -need speech and swallow eval
   -need family meeting after S+S eval
may be candidate for PEG, but this
   is not likely consistent with goals of care.
   -emailed PCP ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 684**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 685**])
 on vacation , but will be back on Monday
   # PNA: Patient with continued RML/RLL infiltrate. On vanc/levo, flagyl
   discontinued yesterday. WBC improving (baseline WBC is 15), Afebrile
   overnight. Cultures without any growth but sputum sample from [**10-12**] with
   contamination.  Effusions likely [**3-4**] aggressive volume resuscitation;
   would not diurese unless increase in O2 requirement.
   - continue vanco/levo
   - resend sputum culture, and tailor abx to culture data
   - aggressive suctioning
   - chest PT
   #. Hypernatremia- hypovolemic. Resolved  with free water boluses and
   D5W
   - can discontinue D5W and decrease free water boluses
   - continue to trend Na
   #. ARF: baseline Cr = 1.1, likely prerenal in setting of profound
   dehydration.  Has been decreasing with fluids, still not back at
   baseline
   - boluses prn
   - start tube feeds for fluid and nutrition
   - redose antibiotics for renal function
   .
   #Decub ulcers: sacral and b/l heel ulcers
   -wound care
   -Kinair bed
   #Anemia- baseline Hct 26-28, currently 24.5 (from 34.6 on admit with
   5LNS).  Pt is guaic +. s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBC, bumped
   appropriately from 21 to 24
   -avoid systemic anticoagulation
   -continue Fe supplementation
   - trend [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfuse for <21 or brisk bleeding
   # Elevated troponin- Ck normal, no ekg changes. trop likely elevated in
   setting of ARF as well as perhaps component of demand ischemia in
   setting of tachycardia and shock.   Trended down with repeat check.
   #hypothyroid- continue levothyroxine
   #dementia/agitation- continue seroquel

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of dementia who presented with hypovolemic shock and pneumonia. He has been admitted to the ICU for aggressive fluid resuscitation and treatment with antibiotics. His condition has improved, but he still requires ongoing care and management for several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic Shock: Resolved, but the patient may need continued monitoring for any signs of fluid imbalance.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has continued right middle lobe/right lower lobe infiltrate. He is currently on vancomycin and levofloxacin, and flagyl has been discontinued. His white blood cell count is improving, and he is afebrile overnight. Cultures show no growth, but a previous sputum sample from [**10-12**] shows contamination. The effusions may require further aggressive volume resuscitation.
3. Hypernatremia-hypovolemic: Resolved with free water boluses and D5W. The patient should continue to trend sodium levels and decrease free water boluses.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.1, likely prerenal in the setting of profound dehydration. His renal function has been decreasing with fluids, but he is not back at baseline. He should receive boluses as needed, start tube feeds for fluid and nutrition, and redose antibiotics"

   Assessment and Plan
   79M with h/o dementia present with primary hypovolemic shock, also with
   PNA now improving with fluid resuscitation and antibiotics.
   #. Hypovolemic Shock: Resolved.  Likely due in large part to poor PO
   intake at home
currently with NGT in place
   - fluid boluses prn to keep MAP>60
   -need speech and swallow eval
   -need family meeting after S+S eval
may be candidate for PEG, but this
   is not likely consistent with goals of care.
   -contact PCP ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 684**] [**Name (NI) 685**])
   # PNA: Patient with continued RML/RLL infiltrate. On vanc/levo, flagyl
   discontinued yesterday. WBC improving (baseline WBC is 15), Afebrile
   overnight. Cultures without any growth but sputum sample from [**10-12**] with
   contamination
   - continue vanco/levo
   - resend sputum culture, and tailure abx to culture data
   - aggressive suctioning
   - follow daily CXR for now
   #. Hypernatremia- hypovolemic. Resolved  ith free water boluses and D5W
   - can discontinue D5W and decrease free water boluses
   - continue to trend Na
   #. ARF: baseline Cr = 1.1, likely prerenal in setting of profound
   dehydration.  Has been decreasing with fluids, still not back at
   baseline
   - boluses prn
   - start tube feeds for fluid and nutrition
   - redose antibiotics for renal function
   .
   #Decub ulcers: sacral and b/l heel ulcers
   -wound care
   -Kinair bed
   #Anemia- baseline Hct 26-28, currently 24.5 (from 34.6 on admit with
   5LNS).  Pt is guaic +. s/p transfusion of 1 unit PRBC, bumped
   appropriately from 21 to 24
   -avoid systemic anticoagulation
   -continue Fe supplementation
   - trend [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfuse for <21 or brisk bleeding
   # Elevated troponin- Ck normal, no ekg changes. trop likely elevated in
   setting of ARF as well as perhaps component of demand ischemia in
   setting of tachycardia and shock.   Trended down with repeat check.
   #hypothyroid- continue levothyroxine
   #dementia/agitation- continue seroquel
   #Chronic issues: Include depression, htn, hyperlipidemia:
   -continue home medications via NGT
   NUTRITION: Tube feeds, pending nutrition recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of dementia, presenting with hypovolemic shock and pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU for fluid resuscitation and antibiotic treatment. His condition has improved, but he still faces several medical complications, including decub ulcers, acute renal failure, anemia, and elevated troponin levels. The patient also has chronic issues such as hypothyroidism, dementia with agitation, depression, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Decub ulcers: The patient has sacral and bilateral heel ulcers, which require wound care and the use of a Kinair bed to prevent further pressure damage.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.1, and it has increased to 3.6. ARF may be pre-renal due to profound dehydration. Fluid resuscitation and ongoing monitoring are necessary. Antibiotics should be redosed for renal function.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low at 24.5 g/dL, likely due to chronic blood loss. Avoid systemic anticoagulation, continue iron supplementation, and consider transfusion if the hemoglobin falls below 21 g/dL or in the case of brisk bleeding.
4. Elevated troponin: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may be attributed to acute renal failure or demand ischemia caused"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of pna (pneumonia), sepsis, and hypernatremia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on several medications including Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Metronidazole, Pantoprazole, Heparin Sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate between 86-120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/48 to 116/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of pneumonia.

The patient's flow sheet data shows fluid balance with a total intake of 3,316 mL and output of 2,340 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 976 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes the use of an aerosol-cool device, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.26. Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds with difficulty hearing due to rhonchi, diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, and absent peripheral pulses in both extremities. Neurologic examination was not assessed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte"
