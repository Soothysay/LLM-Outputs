   Imaging: - Abdominal U/S:
   The hepatic echotexture is within normal limits. No focal nodules
   or masses are identified within the hepatic parenchyma. The portal vein
   is patent with flow in the appropriate direction. There is no intra- or
   extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilation. The common hepatic duct
   measures 5 mm. The gallbladder is nondistended and contains no stones.
   There is no abnormal gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic
   fluid. The pancreatic duct is noted to be diffusely borderline in size
   to mildly dilated throughout its length and is visualized into the
   pancreatic head, although the most distal portion of the duct is
   persistently obscured by overlying bowel gas. In comparison with the CT
   of [**2181-12-5**], the mild ductal dilation appears new and was not
   demonstrated on ultrasound of [**2180-12-5**]. The spleen measures 10.8
   cm and appears unremarkable.
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis. Mild
   dilation of the pancreatic duct diffusely without obstruction stone or
   mass identified, but with incomplete visualization of the most distal
   duct. MRCP could be obtained for further evaluation.
   A page was sent to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5770**] [**Name (STitle) 272**] on [**2182-3-20**] at 5:40 p.m. and the
   results were discussed. Apparently, elevated pancreatic enzymes are
   noted. MRCP may be helpful in excluding a distal common bile duct stone
   or other etiology for dilation of the pancreatic duct and elevated
   pancreatic enzymes.
   - TTE:
   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is seen by
   2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild
   regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of
   the basal to mid anterior wall and anterior septum. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
   normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH with mild anterior and antero-septal
   hypokinesis. Diastolic dysfunction. No significant valvular abnormality
   seen.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review due to technical issues) of [**2180-4-11**], moderate symmetric LVH
   and evidence of anterior/anteroseptal hypokinesis and diastolic
   dysfunction are seen on the current study.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and a prior pulmonary embolism (PE). She presents with new-onset atrial flutter, poorly controlled pain, and pancreatitis. 

The patient's physical examination findings include moderately decreased blood pressures, tachycardia with a heart rate ranging from 110 to 129 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 95%. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial flutter with a ventricular response rate of 110-129 bpm. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), glucose, lactate, and troponin I. Imaging studies reveal no evidence of cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis, but there is mild dilation of the pancreatic duct diffusely without obstruction, stone, or mass identified. An echocardiogram shows moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), mild anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis, diastolic dysfunction, and no significant valvular abnormality.

The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications, including atrial flutter, hypotension, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, chronic diastolic heart failure, chronic pain, somnolence,"

   Continued abdominal pain of uncertain etiology.  Abdomincal CT without

   although blood work improved with continued discomfort.  No evidence of
   ischemic bowel or abdominal catastrophe.  PE shows diffuse abdominal
   tenderness, worse in the RLQ.  We plan abdominal CT with oral and IV
   contrast.  Persistent atrial flutter with intermittent rapid
   ventricular rates
 that are not tolerated.  Rate control has been
   somewhat effective, but she becomes hypotensive at faster heart rates.
   She has been in her arrhythmia < 48 hours and is anticoagulated with
   intravenous heparin.  We plan electrical cardioversion.  Rest of care

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and previous pulmonary embolism (PE). She presented with new-onset atrial flutter and was found to have elevated pancreatic enzymes, suggesting possible pancreatitis. The patient also has moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with mild anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis, diastolic dysfunction, and no significant valvular abnormality seen on echocardiogram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated pancreatic enzymes and abdominal pain suggest the possibility of pancreatitis. Further evaluation with an abdominal CT scan with oral and IV contrast is planned to assess the severity and cause of the pancreatitis.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient's persistent atrial flutter with intermittent rapid ventricular rates that are not tolerated requires rate control and consideration for electrical cardioversion.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension, which could be due to medications, atrial flutter, or an underlying condition. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain blood pressure within normal range.
4. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's echocardiogram findings indicate moderate LVH and diastolic dysfunction, suggesting chronic diastolic heart failure. Rate control measures should be continued, and consideration may be given to medical management with ACE inhibitors"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a previous pulmonary embolism (PE). She presents with new-onset atrial flutter and symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis. The patient has multiple medical complications, including chronic diastolic heart failure, chronic pain, somnolence, ESRD, HTN, DM2, and fluid-electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Flutter: The patient is experiencing new-onset atrial flutter, which can potentially lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest acute pancreatitis, which can be a life-threatening condition if not treated promptly.
3. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of diastolic dysfunction on echocardiogram, indicating chronic diastolic heart failure. This condition can lead to symptoms like shortness of breath and fluid retention.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and she has experienced episodes of hypotension. If not managed properly, hypotension can result in organ perfusion issues.
5. Chronic Pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain, which can impact her quality of life and may require ongoing pain management strategies.

They have undergone several diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, including dccv, MRCP, GGT, AMA, SPEP, ACE level, and GPC from [**3-21**]. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including metoprolol for diastolic dysfunction and vancomycin. They are being infused with heparin sodium and receive hydromorphone (Dilaudid) as needed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature within normal range, a heart rate between 72-135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 64-158/37-102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a normal weight loss of 2.1 kg since admission.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,709 mL with output of 50 mL, resulting in a total balance of 2,659 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support but not on supplemental oxygen. They have clear breath sounds without crackles, wheezes, or bronchial rub.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, anxious appearance, overweight condition, supple neck, normal cardiovascular sounds without S3 or S4, peripheral pulses within normal limits, clear chest sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with mild"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and prior pulmonary embolism (PE). She presents with new-onset atrial flutter and is being evaluated for possible pancreatitis and pain as etiologies. The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypotension, chest pain/nausea/vomiting, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic diastolic heart failure, chronic pain, somnolence, ESRD, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/46 to 158/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient is well-nourished and overweight, showing no acute distress. She has mild tenderness in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) and right upper quadrant (RUQ), but no rebound or guarding. Neurological examination reveals that she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to person, place, and time.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (23,000/uL), hemoglobin (12.6 g/dL), creatinine (5.1 mg/dL), blood glucose (178 mg/dL), and liver enzymes (ALT/AST:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and prior pulmonary embolism (PE). She presented with new-onset atrial flutter, which was successfully controlled with direct current cardioversion (DCCV). The patient also has abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, suggestive of pancreatitis. She has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, so anticoagulation with aspirin alone is continued. The patient has bacteremia likely due to contamination from the long-term intravenous catheter (LIJ GPC). Surveillance cultures are being followed, and vancomycin will be started if fever or leukocytosis develops. The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%. Beta-blocker therapy will be continued, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor will be restarted today. She also has chronic pain, for which methadone is prescribed three times a day, and dilaudid as needed. The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis (M/W/F) and has type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). Insulin glargine is prescribed at bedtime, and insulin sensitivity agents are given. The patient's electrolytes are repleted as needed. Her access for hemodialysis is through a left internal jugular (L-IJ) tunnelled line. Prophyl"

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and previous pulmonary embolism (PE) who presented with new onset atrial flutter. She underwent direct current cardioversion (DCCV) and is now in sinus rhythm. The patient also has abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are suggestive of pancreatitis. She has dark stools this morning, resulting in a 9-point hematocrit drop, and gastrointestinal studies including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and other evaluations are planned to assess for infiltrative hepatic disease. The patient has bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin, with plans to discontinue the line and obtain surveillance cultures. She has chronic diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 60% and is on beta-blocker therapy. The patient also has chronic pain, for which she is taking methadone three times a day and dilaudid as needed. She is undergoing maintenance hemodialysis three times a week. The patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which she is taking glargine at bedtime and insulin sliding scale. She requires repletion of electrolytes as needed and has a left internal jugular (LIJ) tunnelled hemodialysis line. She is on heparin and a bowel regimen as needed. Her emergency contact is her mother, and she"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a previous pulmonary embolism (PE).
- She presents with new onset atrial flutter, which has been controlled with direct current cardioversion (DCCV) and is now in sinus rhythm.
- The patient has abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, suggesting possible pancreatitis.
- She has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, so anticoagulation with aspirin alone is being continued.
- Dark stools were observed this morning, with a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) will be performed to look for stones, and follow-up cultures and gastrointestinal recommendations will be provided.
- The patient has bacteremia caused by a central line infection, most likely contamination from the guardian peritoneal catheter (GPC).
- Surveillance cultures will be followed, and vancomycin will be started if fever or leukocytosis develops.
- The patient has no known coronary artery disease (CAD) but has a CAD equivalent.
- Medical management with aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker will be continued.
- The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%.
- Beta-blocker therapy will be continued, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy"
