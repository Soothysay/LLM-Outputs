   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   1.  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial.  Iron studies show ACD and baseline crit from [**2171**] is
   28.  Her history of diarrhea would be concerning for melena, though BUN
   remains low and normal and no evidence of GI bleed here or at OSH.
   Recent viral gastroenteritis plus alcohol use may have resulted in
   marrow supresssion.  Reticulocyte count of 4 from OSH argues against
   hemolysis and more towards marrow supression.  There is also concern
   for DIC or TTP given low fibrinogen, elevated PTT, and
   thrombocytopenia, rare schistocytes though suspect that these
   abnormalities are secondary to liver failure.   Normal LDH may argue
   against a microangiopathic anemia.  MCV of 120 suggestive of alcohol
   abuse and liver failure.  Iron panel consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease. B12 and folate WNL
   - stool guaiac negative
   - follow hct
   - will need EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] at some point given cirrhosis (call GI/Liver)
   - review peripheral smear
   - f/u DIC labs
   - type and cross 2 units
   - ct abd/pelvis to look for site of bleed, hematoma though no current
   obvious source
   .
   2.  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is improving.  Likely
   secondary to hyponatremia, profound anemia and ?resolving hepatic
   encephalopathy.  No current source of infection.  Currently no
   asterixis but speech remains slow.  No abdominal tenderness or WBC to
   suggest SBP and patient was previously treated with three days of
   unasyn for unclear reason (?SBP, though no para performed).  Head CT
   from OSH negative.  H/o of alcohol abuse, but patient is not delirious
   and does not appear to be withdrawing from alcohol. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA
   currently (only positive for subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - ceftriaxone to cover SBP since unclear if patient had this on
   presentation to OSH
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture
   - f/u cxr
 no infiltrate
   - f/u Head CT
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   - lasix to correct hyponatremia
   3.  Cirrhosis. Patient has mild transaminitis with thrombocytopenia,
   ascites, LE edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR to 2.5.  This
   is likely secondary to cirrhosis from alcoholism.  Currently not
   drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) 83**] history of liver
   biopsy, no prior EGD/[**Last Name (un) **], never seen a hepatologist.  Her recent heavy
   tylenol use may have lead to a more precipitous decline in liver
   function.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound with dopplers showing cirrhosis and
   portal vein thrombosis
   - lasix 20 mg given overnight but UOP response low
   - no urgent indication for paracentesis
   - liver consult
   .
   4.  Diarrhea.  Patient not on lactulose and had diarrhea prior to
   admission.  Concern for viral etiology vs. med effect (was on magnesium
   oxide at OSH).  C. diff negative at outside hospital.
   - stool studies
   - stool G- so far
   .
   5.  Hyperbilirubinemia.  Patient has first onset jaundice in setting of
   heavy alcohol abuse and recent heavy tylenol use due to plantar
   fascitis.  Concerning for jaudice due to liver failure, though per OSH
   report on presentation, hyperbilirubinemia was predominantly indirect
   (T. bili 17.1, D. bili 5.4).  In the setting of getting 10 units of
   blood, T. bili rose to 37 with D. bili of 23.  Suspect that
   hyperbilirubinemia is related to liver failure, but may have element of
   hemolysis (though labs do not substantiate this - retic count 4, LDH
   normal, hapto undectable but liver patient).  No current evidence of
   bleeding or hematoma and no localizing symptoms at present.
   - follow bili
   - follow Hct
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - consider hematology consult
   .
   6.  Thrombocytopenia.  Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  However, will evaluate for TTP and DIC.  Rare
   schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low fibrinogen, and
   hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal, arguing against TMA.
   - follow DIC labs
   - follow plt count
   - transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of active bleeding
   .
   7. Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to ascites and LE edema.
   - improved with lasix 20 mg IV overnight
   - follow sodium
   .
   8.  LE edema.  B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to liver
   failure, however, will evaluate cardiac function with echo as well.
   - echo
   - lasix IV 20 mg x 1 given last night
   9.  H/o alcohol abuse. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently (only positive for
   subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - continue valium CIWA scale
   - continue vitamins, folate, thiamine
   - sw consult when mental status improves
   .

   low sodium diet

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has cirrhosis presumed secondary to alcoholism, along with ascites, LE edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR. She also has thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, hyperbilirubinemia, and hyponatremia. The patient's condition has been improving, but there are still several potential medical complications to monitor and manage.

Potential medical complications:

1. Anemia: The etiology of the patient's profound anemia is unclear and likely multifactorial. There is concern for marrow suppression due to recent viral gastroenteritis and alcohol use, as well as possible DIC or TTP. Further evaluation and management are required.

2. Altered mental status: The patient has AMS that is improving, likely secondary to hyponatremia, profound anemia, and resolving hepatic encephalopathy. No current source of infection is evident, but it is important to monitor the patient's mental status and consider potential causes such as delirium or alcohol withdrawal.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has mild transaminitis with thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR. This is likely secondary to cirrhosis from alcohol"

   fascitis.  Concerning for jaudice due to liver failure, though per OSH
   report on presentation, hyperbilirubinemia was predominantly indirect
   (T. bili 17.1, D. bili 5.4).  In the setting of getting 10 units of
   blood, T. bili rose to 37 with D. bili of 23.  Suspect that
   hyperbilirubinemia is related to liver failure, but may have element of
   hemolysis (though labs do not substantiate this - retic count 4, LDH
   normal, hapto undectable but liver patient).  No current evidence of
   bleeding or hematoma and no localizing symptoms at present.
   - follow bili
   - follow Hct
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - consider hematology consult
   .
   .
   6.  Thrombocytopenia.  Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  However, will evaluate for TTP and DIC.  Rare
   schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low fibrinogen, and
   hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal, arguing against TMA.
   - follow DIC labs
   - follow plt count
   - transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of active bleeding

   failure, however, will evaluate cardiac function with echo as well.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. She has cirrhosis, likely secondary to alcoholism, as evidenced by her history of heavy alcohol use, nodular heterogeneous shrunken liver on ultrasound, main portal vein thrombosis, and splenomegaly. The patient also has ascites, LE edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and an elevated INR of 2.5, which indicates liver dysfunction.

The patient's anemia is profound with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, and the etiology is unclear. Iron studies show ACD (anemia of chronic disease) and a baseline crit (critical value) from [**2171**] is 28. Her history of diarrhea raises concern for melena, but BUN (blood urea nitrogen) remains low and normal, and there is no evidence of GI bleed. Recent viral gastroenteritis, along with alcohol use, may have resulted in marrow suppression. The reticulocyte count of 4 from OSH argues against hemolysis and more towards marrow suppression. There is also concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) given the low fibrinogen, elevated PTT (partial thromboplastin time), and thrombocytopenia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   1.  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial.  Iron studies show ACD and baseline crit from [**2171**] is
   28.  Her history of diarrhea would be concerning for melena, though BUN
   remains low and normal and no evidence of GI bleed here or at OSH.
   Recent viral gastroenteritis plus alcohol use may have resulted in
   marrow supresssion.  Reticulocyte count of 4 from OSH argues against
   hemolysis and more towards marrow supression.  There is also concern
   for DIC or TTP given low fibrinogen, elevated PTT, and
   thrombocytopenia, rare schistocytes though suspect that these
   abnormalities are secondary to liver failure.   Normal LDH may argue
   against a microangiopathic anemia.  MCV of 120 suggestive of alcohol
   abuse and liver failure.  Iron panel consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease. B12 and folate WNL
   - stool guaiac negative
   - follow hct
   - will need EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] at some point given cirrhosis (call GI/Liver)
   - review peripheral smear
   - f/u DIC labs
   - type and cross 2 units
   - ct abd/pelvis to look for site of bleed, hematoma though no current
   obvious source
   .
   2.  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is improving.  Likely
   secondary to hyponatremia, profound anemia and ?resolving hepatic
   encephalopathy.  No current source of infection.  Currently no
   asterixis but speech remains slow.  No abdominal tenderness or WBC to
   suggest SBP and patient was previously treated with three days of
   unasyn for unclear reason (?SBP, though no para performed).  Head CT
   from OSH negative.  H/o of alcohol abuse, but patient is not delirious
   and does not appear to be withdrawing from alcohol. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA
   currently (only positive for subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - ceftriaxone to cover SBP since unclear if patient had this on
   presentation to OSH
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture
   - f/u cxr
 no infiltrate
   - f/u Head CT
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   - lasix to correct hyponatremia
   3.  Cirrhosis. Patient has mild transaminitis with thrombocytopenia,
   ascites, LE edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR to 2.5.  This
   is likely secondary to cirrhosis from alcoholism.  Currently not
   drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) 83**] history of liver
   biopsy, no prior EGD/[**Last Name (un) **], never seen a hepatologist.  Her recent heavy
   tylenol use may have lead to a more precipitous decline in liver
   function.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound with dopplers showing cirrhosis and
   portal vein thrombosis
   - lasix 20 mg given overnight but UOP response low
   - no urgent indication for paracentesis
   - liver consult
   .
   4.  Diarrhea.  Patient not on lactulose and had diarrhea prior to
   admission.  Concern for viral etiology vs. med effect (was on magnesium
   oxide at OSH).  C. diff negative at outside hospital.
   - stool studies
   - stool G- so far
   .
   5.  Hyperbilirubinemia.  Patient has first onset jaundice in setting of
   heavy alcohol abuse and recent heavy tylenol use due to plantar
   fascitis.  Concerning for jaudice due to liver failure, though per OSH
   report on presentation, hyperbilirubinemia was predominantly indirect
   (T. bili 17.1, D. bili 5.4).  In the setting of getting 10 units of
   blood, T. bili rose to 37 with D. bili of 23.  Suspect that
   hyperbilirubinemia is related to liver failure, but may have element of
   hemolysis (though labs do not substantiate this - retic count 4, LDH
   normal, hapto undectable but liver patient).  No current evidence of
   bleeding or hematoma and no localizing symptoms at present.
   - follow bili
   - follow Hct
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - consider hematology consult
   .
   6.  Thrombocytopenia.  Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  However, will evaluate for TTP and DIC.  Rare
   schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low fibrinogen, and
   hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal, arguing against TMA.
   - follow DIC labs
   - follow plt count
   - transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of active bleeding
   .
   7. Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to ascites and LE edema.
   - improved with lasix 20 mg IV overnight
   - follow sodium
   .
   8.  LE edema.  B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to liver
   failure, however, will evaluate cardiac function with echo as well.
   - echo
   - lasix IV 20 mg x 1 given last night; will give another 40 mg IV this
   AM
   9.  H/o alcohol abuse. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently (only positive for
   subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - continue valium CIWA scale
   - continue vitamins, folate, thiamine
   - sw consult when mental status improves
   .

   low sodium diet

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, anemia, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been stable overnight, with no acute distress or changes in vital signs. However, there are some concerning findings including impaired skin integrity, anisocoria (unequal pupil size), and a systolic murmur on cardiovascular examination. The patient also has a history of pain control, both acute and chronic. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, as well as thrombocytopenia. Imaging studies reveal cirrhotic liver, main portal vein thrombosis, ascites, and splenomegaly.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and altered mental status, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function as a result of severe liver disease.

2. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and history of alcohol abuse increase the risk of skin infections. Additionally, the presence of a central line raises the possibility of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

3. Bleeding: Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and coagulopathy (elevated PT/PTT/IN"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, anemia, altered mental status, and pain control. The patient was transferred from an outside hospital and experienced a decline in urine output overnight. Initial assessments included an EKG, ultrasound, and nasal swab for MRSA. The patient received intravenous medications such as furosemide and ceftriaxone. Vital signs are stable, with some fluctuations in temperature and blood pressure. The patient's heart rhythm is normal. Fluid balance shows an intake of 130 mL and output of 180 mL over the past 24 hours. Respiratory support is not required. Laboratory results indicate low white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormalities in potassium and sodium levels. Imaging reveals cirrhotic liver with portal vein thrombosis, ascites, and splenomegaly. The patient has impaired skin integrity and a history of hemolytic anemia. The plan includes ICU care for glycemic control, pain management, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis, further decline in renal function, development of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection, exacerbation of anemia, and complications related to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis. She presents with symptoms including two weeks of nonbloody diarrhea, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient's laboratory results show elevated bilirubin levels, coagulopathy, and mild transaminitis. She also has hyponatremia, which has improved. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she is experiencing multi-organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, along with her altered mental status, hepatic encephalopathy is a potential complication. This condition occurs when toxins accumulate in the bloodstream due to liver dysfunction, leading to cognitive impairment.

2. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. Infections can be particularly serious in patients with compromised immune systems or liver dysfunction.

3. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT): The patient's abdominal imaging shows a portal vein thrombus. PVT is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and can lead to further liver damage and portal hypertension.

4. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing nonbloody diarrhea for two weeks. Diarrhea in cirrhotic patients can be caused by various factors such as infections or medication side effects.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels may contribute to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   1.  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial.  Iron studies show ACD and baseline crit from [**2171**] is
   28.  Her history of diarrhea would be concerning for melena, though BUN
   remains low and normal and no evidence of GI bleed here or at OSH.
   Recent viral gastroenteritis plus alcohol use may have resulted in
   marrow supresssion.  Reticulocyte count of 4 from OSH argues against
   hemolysis and more towards marrow supression.  There is also concern
   for DIC or TTP given low fibrinogen, elevated PTT, and
   thrombocytopenia, rare schistocytes though suspect that these
   abnormalities are secondary to liver failure.   Normal LDH may argue
   against a microangiopathic anemia.  MCV of 120 suggestive of alcohol
   abuse and liver failure.  Iron panel consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease. B12 and folate WNL
   - stool guaiac negative
   - follow hct
   - will need EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] at some point given cirrhosis (call GI/Liver)
   - review peripheral smear
   - f/u DIC labs
   - type and cross 2 units
   - ct abd/pelvis to look for site of bleed, hematoma though no current
   obvious source
   .
   2.  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is improving.  Likely
   secondary to hyponatremia, profound anemia and ?resolving hepatic
   encephalopathy.  No current source of infection.  Currently no
   asterixis but speech remains slow.  No abdominal tenderness or WBC to
   suggest SBP and patient was previously treated with three days of
   unasyn for unclear reason (?SBP, though no para performed).  Head CT
   from OSH negative.  H/o of alcohol abuse, but patient is not delirious
   and does not appear to be withdrawing from alcohol. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA
   currently (only positive for subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - ceftriaxone to cover SBP since unclear if patient had this on
   presentation to OSH
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture
   - f/u cxr
 no infiltrate
   - f/u Head CT
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   - lasix to correct hyponatremia
   3.  Cirrhosis. Patient has mild transaminitis with thrombocytopenia,
   ascites, LE edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR to 2.5.  This
   is likely secondary to cirrhosis from alcoholism.  Currently not
   drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) 83**] history of liver
   biopsy, no prior EGD/[**Last Name (un) **], never seen a hepatologist.  Her recent heavy
   tylenol use may have lead to a more precipitous decline in liver
   function.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound with dopplers showing cirrhosis and
   portal vein thrombosis
   - lasix 20 mg given overnight but UOP response low
   - no urgent indication for paracentesis
   - liver consult
   .
   4.  Diarrhea.  Patient not on lactulose and had diarrhea prior to
   admission.  Concern for viral etiology vs. med effect (was on magnesium
   oxide at OSH).  C. diff negative at outside hospital.
   - stool studies
   - stool G- so far
   .
   5.  Hyperbilirubinemia.  Patient has first onset jaundice in setting of
   heavy alcohol abuse and recent heavy tylenol use due to plantar
   fascitis.  Concerning for jaudice due to liver failure, though per OSH
   report on presentation, hyperbilirubinemia was predominantly indirect
   (T. bili 17.1, D. bili 5.4).  In the setting of getting 10 units of
   blood, T. bili rose to 37 with D. bili of 23.  Suspect that
   hyperbilirubinemia is related to liver failure, but may have element of
   hemolysis (though labs do not substantiate this - retic count 4, LDH
   normal, hapto undectable but liver patient).  No current evidence of
   bleeding or hematoma and no localizing symptoms at present.
   - follow bili
   - follow Hct
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - consider hematology consult
   .
   6.  Thrombocytopenia.  Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  However, will evaluate for TTP and DIC.  Rare
   schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low fibrinogen, and
   hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal, arguing against TMA.
   - follow DIC labs
   - follow plt count
   - transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of active bleeding
   .
   7. Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to ascites and LE edema.
   - improved with lasix 20 mg IV overnight
   - follow sodium
   .
   8.  LE edema.  B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to liver
   failure, however, will evaluate cardiac function with echo as well.
   - echo
   - lasix IV 20 mg x 1 given last night; will give another 40 mg IV this
   AM
   9.  H/o alcohol abuse. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently (only positive for
   subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - continue valium CIWA scale
   - continue vitamins, folate, thiamine
   - sw consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on clears -> advance as tolerated to
   low sodium diet
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of presumed secondary cirrhosis due to alcoholism. The patient presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Anemia: The etiology of the profound anemia is unclear and likely multifactorial. Iron studies show anemia of chronic disease (ACD), and the patient has a history of diarrhea, which could be concerning for melena. There is also concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) given the low fibrinogen, elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and thrombocytopenia. However, normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels argue against microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.

2. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which is improving. It is likely secondary to hyponatremia, profound anemia, and possibly resolving hepatic encephalopathy. No current source of infection is identified, and there is no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has mild transaminitis with thrombocytopenia, ascites, lower extremity edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and an elevated international normalized ratio"

   RUQ U/S [**3-12**]: Nodular, shrunken, heterogenous liver c/w cirrhosis;
   ascites; splenomegaly; main portal vein thrombosis.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy that is not clearing due to
   fixed portal vein obstruction. Currently no asterixis but speech
   remains slow and global decreased tone and reflexes.  Also confounded
   by hyponatremia and anemia.  No current source of infection, CXR
   negative for infiltrate.  No abdominal tenderness or WBC to suggest SBP
   and patient was previously treated with three days of Unasyn for
   unclear reason. Head CT from OSH negative.  H/o of alcohol abuse, but
   patient is not delirious and does not appear to be withdrawing from
   alcohol. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently. Head CT here ([**3-13**]) neg for
   acute intracranial process. There is concern also for cerebral edema in
   setting of fulminant liver failure. Will have low threshold to repeat
   head CT if mental status quickly declines or does not clear.
   - Continue ceftriaxone to cover SBP since unclear if patient had this
   on presentation to OSH.
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   - lasix to correct hyponatremia
   - Would maintain low threshold to intubate patient as mental status
   declines,
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilrubinemia / portal vein thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with current thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR to 2.5.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per
   patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) **] recent heavy acetaminophen use may have lead
   to a more precipitous decline in liver function. Would like to further
   delineated the timecourse of portal vein thombosis, as treatment with
   systemic or local anticoagulation is risky in this coagulopathic
   patient. At this time, it seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   portal ciculation. Would consider further imaging, such as contrasted
   CT, if needed. The ascetic fluid did not appear to be SBP, as WBC was
   only 25, however the patient did receive treatment (Unasyn) for 3 days
   prior to arrival from OSH. With current GI bleed per rectum, EGD would
   be helpful for source identification and possible therapy if active
   bleeding or varices are noted.
   Hyperbilirubinemia likely due to combination of chronic heavy alcohol
   abuse and recent increased acetaminophen use due to plantar fasciitis.
   Per OSH report on presentation, hyperbilirubinemia was predominantly
   indirect (T. bili 17.1, D. bili 5.4).  After receiving 5-10 units of
   PRBCs at OSH, T. bili rose to 37 with D. bili of 23.  [**Month (only) 11**] have element
   of hemolysis but labs will be difficult to interpret in setting of
   liver failure.
   - follow bili - stable
   - follow Hct - stable
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - liver consult recs: continue steroids, will coordinate EGD
   - Will ask Hepatology re: adding rifaximin
   .
   #  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial, however BRBPR is the most concerning etiology.  Iron
   studies show ACD and baseline HCT from [**2171**] is 28.  Recent viral
   gastroenteritis plus alcohol use may have resulted in marrow
   supresssion.  Reticulocyte count of 4 from OSH argues against hemolysis
   and more towards marrow supression. There is also concern for DIC or
   TTP given low fibrinogen, elevated PTT, and thrombocytopenia, rare
   schistocytes though suspect that these abnormalities are secondary to
   liver failure.   Normal LDH may argue against a microangiopathic
   anemia.  B12 and folate WNL. Had episode of BRBPR the AM of [**3-14**] with
   some clot on sheet. Typed and crossed for 2 units.
   - follow hct: 26.6 -> 29.0 this AM after BRBPR noted
   - Would check q4hr HCT while patient is actively bleeding
   - Plan to get EGD this AM ([**3-14**]), but likely will need colonoscopy as

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of presumed alcoholism, presenting with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications including cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinemia, portal vein thrombosis, altered mental status (AMS), gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hyponatremia, and lower extremity edema.

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, which is not clearing due to a fixed portal vein obstruction. There is concern for cerebral edema in the setting of fulminant liver failure. The patient's anemia is multifactorial, with bone marrow suppression being the most concerning etiology. There is also concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) due to low fibrinogen, elevated PTT, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's liver function tests show mild transaminitis with current thrombocytopenia, ascites, lower extremity edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR of 2.5. She has hyperbilirubinemia likely due to chronic heavy alcohol abuse and recent increased acetaminophen use. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to liver failure"

   RUQ U/S [**3-12**]: Nodular, shrunken, heterogenous liver c/w cirrhosis;
   ascites; splenomegaly; main portal vein thrombosis.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   1.  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial.  Iron studies show ACD and baseline crit from [**2171**] is
   28.  Her history of diarrhea would be concerning for melena, though BUN
   remains low and normal and no evidence of GI bleed here or at OSH.
   Recent viral gastroenteritis plus alcohol use may have resulted in
   marrow supresssion.  Reticulocyte count of 4 from OSH argues against
   hemolysis and more towards marrow supression.  There is also concern
   for DIC or TTP given low fibrinogen, elevated PTT, and
   thrombocytopenia, rare schistocytes though suspect that these
   abnormalities are secondary to liver failure.   Normal LDH may argue
   against a microangiopathic anemia.  MCV of 120 suggestive of alcohol
   abuse and liver failure.  Iron panel consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease. B12 and folate WNL. Had episode of BRBPR the AM of [**3-14**] with
   some clot on sheet. Typed and crossed for 2 units.
   - follow hct: 26.6 -> 29.0 this AM
   - Plan to get EGD this AM ([**3-14**]), but likely will need colonoscopy as
   well, if no bleeding seen
 did not start bowel prep
   - review peripheral smear
   - f/u DIC labs - pending
   - ct abd/pelvis to look for site of bleed, hematoma though no current
   obvious source
   .
   2.  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   Likely secondary to hyponatremia, profound anemia and ?resolving
   hepatic encephalopathy.  No current source of infection.  Currently no
   asterixis but speech remains slow.  No abdominal tenderness or WBC to
   suggest SBP and patient was previously treated with three days of
   unasyn for unclear reason (?SBP, though no para performed).  Head CT
   from OSH negative.  H/o of alcohol abuse, but patient is not delirious
   and does not appear to be withdrawing from alcohol. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA
   currently (only positive for subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - ceftriaxone to cover SBP since unclear if patient had this on
   presentation to OSH. Head Ct neg for acute intracranial process.
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture
   - f/u cxr
 no infiltrate
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   - lasix to correct hyponatremia
   3.  Cirrhosis. Patient has mild transaminitis with thrombocytopenia,
   ascites, LE edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR to 2.5.  This
   is likely secondary to cirrhosis from alcoholism.  Currently not
   drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) 83**] history of liver
   biopsy, no prior EGD/[**Last Name (un) **], never seen a hepatologist.  Her recent heavy
   tylenol use may have lead to a more precipitous decline in liver
   function.
   - complete abdominal ultrasound with dopplers showing cirrhosis and
   portal vein thrombosis
 final read as above
   - Minimal response to Lasix
   - paracentesis
 WBC 25
   - liver consult recs: add steroids
   .
   4.  Diarrhea.  Patient not on lactulose and had diarrhea prior to
   admission.  Concern for viral etiology vs. med effect (was on magnesium
   oxide at OSH).  C. diff negative at outside hospital.
   - stool studies
   - stool grossly positive AM of [**3-14**]
   .
   5.  Hyperbilirubinemia.  Patient has first onset jaundice in setting of
   heavy alcohol abuse and recent heavy tylenol use due to plantar
   fasciitis.  Concerning for jaundice due to liver failure, though per
   OSH report on presentation, hyperbilirubinemia was predominantly
   indirect (T. bili 17.1, D. bili 5.4).  In the setting of getting 10
   units of blood, T. bili rose to 37 with D. bili of 23.  Suspect that
   hyperbilirubinemia is related to liver failure, but may have element of
   hemolysis (though labs do not substantiate this - retic count 4, LDH
   normal, hapto undectable but liver patient).  Grossly positive stool.
   - follow bili - stable
   - follow Hct - stable
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - consider hematology consult
   .
   6.  Thrombocytopenia.  Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  However, will evaluate for TTP and DIC.  Rare
   schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low fibrinogen, and
   hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal, arguing against TMA.
   - follow DIC labs - pending
   - follow plt count
   - transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of active bleeding
   .
   7. Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to ascites and LE edema.
   - improved with lasix 20 mg IV
   - follow sodium
   .
   8.  LE edema.  B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to liver
   failure, however, will evaluate cardiac function with echo as well.
   - echo
   - Lasix, PRN
   9.  H/o alcohol abuse. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently (only positive for
   subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - continue valium CIWA scale
   - continue vitamins, folate, thiamine

   RUQ U/S [**3-12**]: Nodular, shrunken, heterogenous liver c/w cirrhosis;
   ascites; splenomegaly; main portal vein thrombosis.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   Likely secondary to hyponatremia, profound anemia and ?resolving
   hepatic encephalopathy.  No current source of infection.  Currently no
   asterixis but speech remains slow.  No abdominal tenderness or WBC to
   suggest SBP and patient was previously treated with three days of
   unasyn for unclear reason (?SBP, though no para performed).  Head CT
   from OSH negative.  H/o of alcohol abuse, but patient is not delirious
   and does not appear to be withdrawing from alcohol. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA
   currently (only positive for subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - ceftriaxone to cover SBP since unclear if patient had this on
   presentation to OSH. Head CT ([**3-13**]) neg for acute intracranial process.
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture
   - f/u cxr
 no infiltrate
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   - lasix to correct hyponatremia
   - Would maintain low threshold to intubate patient as mental status
   declines,
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilrubinemia / portal vein thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with current thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR to 2.5.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per
   patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) **] recent heavy acetaminophen use may have lead
   to a more precipitous decline in liver function. Would like to further
   delineated the timecourse of portal vein thombosis, as treatment with
   systemic or local anticoagulation is risky in this coagulopathic
   patient. At this time, it seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   portal ciculation. Would consider further imaging, such as contrasted
   CT, if needed. The ascetic fluid did not appear to be SBP, as WBC was
   only 25, however the patient did receive treatment (Unasyn) for 3 days
   prior to arrival from OSH. With current GI bleed per rectum, EGD would
   be helpful for source identification and possible therapy if active
   bleeding or varices are noted.
   Hyperbilirubinemia likely due to combination of chronic heavy alcohol
   abuse and recent increased acetaminophen use due to plantar fasciitis.
   Per OSH report on presentation, hyperbilirubinemia was predominantly
   indirect (T. bili 17.1, D. bili 5.4).  After receiving 5-10 units of
   PRBCs at OSH, T. bili rose to 37 with D. bili of 23.  [**Month (only) 11**] have element
   of hemolysis but labs will be difficult to interpret in setting of
   liver failure
   - follow bili - stable
   - follow Hct - stable
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - consider hematology consult
   - liver consult recs: continue steroids, will coordinate EGD
   .
   #  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial.  Iron studies show ACD and baseline crit from [**2171**] is
   28.  Her history of diarrhea would be concerning for melena, though BUN
   remains low and normal and no evidence of GI bleed here or at OSH.
   Recent viral gastroenteritis plus alcohol use may have resulted in
   marrow supresssion.  Reticulocyte count of 4 from OSH argues against
   hemolysis and more towards marrow supression.  There is also concern
   for DIC or TTP given low fibrinogen, elevated PTT, and
   thrombocytopenia, rare schistocytes though suspect that these
   abnormalities are secondary to liver failure.   Normal LDH may argue
   against a microangiopathic anemia.  MCV of 120 suggestive of alcohol
   abuse and liver failure.  Iron panel consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease. B12 and folate WNL. Had episode of BRBPR the AM of [**3-14**] with
   some clot on sheet. Typed and crossed for 2 units.
   - follow hct: 26.6 -> 29.0 this AM
   - Plan to get EGD this AM ([**3-14**]), but likely will need colonoscopy as
   well, if no bleeding seen
 did not start bowel prep
   - review peripheral smear
   - f/u DIC labs - pending
   - ct abd/pelvis to look for site of bleed, hematoma though no current
   obvious source
   .
   .
   4.  Diarrhea.  Patient not on lactulose and had diarrhea prior to
   admission.  Concern for viral etiology vs. med effect (was on magnesium
   oxide at OSH).  C. diff negative at outside hospital.
   - stool studies
   - stool grossly positive AM of [**3-14**]
   .
   .
   6.  Thrombocytopenia.  Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  However, will evaluate for TTP and DIC.  Rare
   schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low fibrinogen, and
   hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal, arguing against TMA.
   - follow DIC labs - pending
   - follow plt count
   - transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of active bleeding
   .
   7. Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to ascites and LE edema.
   - improved with lasix 20 mg IV
   - follow sodium
   .
   8.  LE edema.  B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to liver
   failure, however, will evaluate cardiac function with echo as well.
   - echo
   - Lasix, PRN
   9.  H/o alcohol abuse. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently (only positive for
   subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - continue valium CIWA scale
   - continue vitamins, folate, thiamine
   - sw consult when mental status improves

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of presumed alcoholism, presenting with cirrhosis, anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis, ascites, and splenomegaly. The patient's liver function tests indicate mild transaminitis and elevated INR. She is also experiencing LE edema, hyperbilirubinemia, and thrombocytopenia. The etiology of her profound anemia is unclear and likely multifactorial. There is concern for DIC or TTP due to low fibrinogen, elevated PTT, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has a history of diarrhea, and her BUN remains low. She is currently being treated for suspected SBP, but the ascitic fluid analysis did not reveal any signs of infection. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and she is at risk of intubation as her mental status declines. She is receiving lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, lasix to correct hyponatremia, and steroids per liver recommendations. Further evaluation with EGD and colonoscopy is planned to identify the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and she is receiving ICU level of care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic hepatitis, anemia, and hemolytic anemia. He is currently in the ICU due to complications from cirrhosis. The patient has undergone several diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, including a diagnostic paracentesis, placement and removal of a Dobhoff catheter, administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TF), and initiation of steroids. The patient also had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and central venous catheter (CVC) removal.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, with a heart rate of 107 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal range at 115/70 mmHg. Respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is slightly low at 36.6 degrees Celsius.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,030 mL and output of 893 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,137 mL. The patient has received 1,500 mL of intravenous fluids and 360 mL of oral intake. The patient's urine output is 518 mL.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 30,000 cells/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL,"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with h/o ETOH cirrhosis and Tylenol excess now admitted
   with jaundice and hepatic dysfunction.  She has had steroid Rx started
   in past 24 hours and has active issue being considered as to timing of
   portal vein thrombosis contributing to acute worsening.  Found this am
   was blood clot noted around rectal tube
   Altered Mental Status
this is a dense encephaoloapthy which has
   progressed over time in the setting of relative stability of hepatic
   dysfunction.  She has multiple metabolic abnormalities which may be
   contributing to her mental dysfunction.  At this time hepatic
   encephaolopathy, no medication given since arrival here, no focal
   deficits and decreased tone on exam.  This would make hepatic
   encephaolopathy clearly most likely diagnosis with complete PV
   obstruction driving limited response to conventional treatment.
   -Continue with Lactulose
   -Consider Rifaximin
   -Follow exam
   -Repeat head CT for failure to improve today with hepatic
   encephalopathy Rx and/or worsening exam as concern for cerebral edema
   is real
   -Normalize Na+
   Portal Vein Thrombosis-
   -Will look with EGD
   -Will have to consider anticoagulation systemically
   -Will pursue possibility of local therapies given risk of systemic
   bleeding
   EtOH abuse
   -Folate/Thiamine
   -CIWA
   Cirrhosis and Hepatic Failure-
   -Vita K/Lactulose/Predisone
   -CTX 1g q 24
   GI Bleed-Suggestion of active bleeding in the setting of stable HCT
   -EGD today
   -For prominent varices will have to consider possible TIPSS depending
   on GI EGD findings
   -HCT q 4 hours today
   -Follow up fibrinogen
   -Thrombocytopenia
continued and maintained at >30 in the setting of
   active bleeding
   -CVL in place
   -[**Month (only) 11**] need to consider intubation prior to EGD today.
   LE Edema-
   -Patient with ECHO today to consider right sided failure, PPH is
   certainly possible.

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis and Tylenol excess, now admitted with jaundice and hepatic dysfunction. She has been started on steroid treatment in the past 24 hours and is experiencing an active issue regarding the timing of portal vein thrombosis contributing to acute worsening. This morning, a blood clot was noted around the rectal tube.

The patient has altered mental status, which is described as a dense encephalopathy that has progressed over time in the setting of relative stability of hepatic dysfunction. She has multiple metabolic abnormalities that may be contributing to her mental dysfunction. At this time, hepatic encephalopathy is the most likely diagnosis, with complete PV obstruction driving limited response to conventional treatment.

The plan includes continuing with lactulose, considering rifaximin, following the exam, repeating a head CT for failure to improve today with hepatic encephalopathy treatment and/or worsening exam as concern for cerebral edema is real, and normalizing sodium levels.

Portal vein thrombosis is also present and will be further investigated with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The possibility of anticoagulation will be considered, along with local therapies given the risk of systemic bleeding.

The patient's history of ETOH abuse will be addressed with folate/thiamine supplementation and CIWA management. Cirrhosis and hepatic failure will be managed with vita K/l"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**].
   Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy that is not clearing due to
   fixed portal vein obstruction. Currently no asterixis but speech
   remains slow and global decreased tone and reflexes.  Also confounded
   by hyponatremia and anemia.  No current source of infection, CXR
   negative for infiltrate.  No abdominal tenderness or WBC to suggest SBP
   and patient was previously treated with three days of Unasyn for
   unclear reason. Head CT from OSH negative.  H/o of alcohol abuse, but
   patient is not delirious and does not appear to be withdrawing from
   alcohol. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently. Head CT here ([**3-13**]) neg for
   acute intracranial process. There is concern also for cerebral edema in
   setting of fulminant liver failure. Will have low threshold to repeat
   head CT if mental status quickly declines or does not clear.
   - Continue ceftriaxone to cover SBP since unclear if patient had this
   on presentation to OSH.
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   - lasix to correct hyponatremia
   - Would maintain low threshold to intubate patient as mental status
   declines,
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilrubinemia / portal vein thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with current thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR to 2.5.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per
   patient and husband.  [**Name (NI) **] recent heavy acetaminophen use may have lead
   to a more precipitous decline in liver function. Would like to further
   delineated the timecourse of portal vein thombosis, as treatment with
   systemic or local anticoagulation is risky in this coagulopathic
   patient. At this time, it seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   portal ciculation. Would consider further imaging, such as contrasted
   CT, if needed. The ascetic fluid did not appear to be SBP, as WBC was
   only 25, however the patient did receive treatment (Unasyn) for 3 days
   prior to arrival from OSH. With current GI bleed per rectum, EGD would
   be helpful for source identification and possible therapy if active
   bleeding or varices are noted.
   Hyperbilirubinemia likely due to combination of chronic heavy alcohol
   abuse and recent increased acetaminophen use due to plantar fasciitis.
   Per OSH report on presentation, hyperbilirubinemia was predominantly
   indirect (T. bili 17.1, D. bili 5.4).  After receiving 5-10 units of
   PRBCs at OSH, T. bili rose to 37 with D. bili of 23.  [**Month (only) 11**] have element
   of hemolysis but labs will be difficult to interpret in setting of
   liver failure.
   - follow bili - stable
   - follow Hct - stable
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - liver consult recs: continue steroids, will coordinate EGD
   - Will ask Hepatology re: adding rifaximin
   .
   #  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial, however BRBPR is the most concerning etiology.  Iron
   studies show ACD and baseline HCT from [**2171**] is 28.  Recent viral
   gastroenteritis plus alcohol use may have resulted in marrow
   supresssion.  Reticulocyte count of 4 from OSH argues against hemolysis
   and more towards marrow supression. There is also concern for DIC or
   TTP given low fibrinogen, elevated PTT, and thrombocytopenia, rare
   schistocytes though suspect that these abnormalities are secondary to
   liver failure.   Normal LDH may argue against a microangiopathic
   anemia.  B12 and folate WNL. Had episode of BRBPR the AM of [**3-14**] with
   some clot on sheet. Typed and crossed for 2 units.
   - follow hct: 26.6 -> 29.0 this AM after BRBPR noted
   - Would check q4hr HCT while patient is actively bleeding
   - Plan to get EGD this AM ([**3-14**]), but likely will need colonoscopy as
   well, if no bleeding seen
 did not start bowel prep
   - review peripheral smear
   - f/u DIC labs
 but difficult to assess with liver failure
   - CT abd/pelvis to look for site of bleed, hematoma though no current
   obvious source
 f/u final read
   - consider hematology consult
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia.  Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA.
   - follow DIC labs - pending
   - Follow plt count and would transfuse as patient actively bleeding
   - transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of active bleeding
   .
   #  Diarrhea.  Patient had diarrhea prior to admission.  Concern for
   viral etiology vs. med effect (was on magnesium oxide at OSH).  C. diff
   negative at outside hospital.
   - F/u stool studies
   - Stool grossly positive AM of [**3-14**].
   .
   # Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to ascites and LE edema. Improving.
   - improved with lasix 20 mg IV
   - follow sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   8.  LE edema.  B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to liver
   failure, however, will evaluate cardiac function with echo as well.
   - TTE today [**3-14**]
   - Lasix, PRN
   9.  H/o alcohol abuse. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently (only positive for
   subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - continue valium CIWA scale
   - continue vitamins, folate, thiamine
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, on clears -> but will hold with
   declining MS, TF started [**3-13**] w/ nutrition recs
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, presenting with altered mental status, anemia, jaundice, and cirrhosis. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but she has evidence of fluid overload and edema. The patient's laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient is currently receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, diuretics, and medications for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is also on a feeding tube and receiving nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can progress to coma if not managed appropriately.

2. Anemia: The patient has profound anemia, with an unclear etiology. The most concerning cause is bone marrow suppression, possibly due to recent viral gastroenteritis and alcohol use. However, other potential causes such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) should also be considered.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has evidence of cirrhosis, likely secondary to alcoholism. This condition can lead to complications such as portal vein thrombosis, ascites, and hepatosplenomegaly.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**],
   clearing up the AM of [**3-15**].  Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy
   that is not clearing due to fixed [**Date Range 4182**] [**Date Range 4244**] obstruction. Also
   confounded by hyponatremia and anemia.  No clear source of infection,
   CXR negative for infiltrate.  Having abdominal tenderness B/L [**3-15**]. WBC
   not elevated to suggest SBP and patient was previously treated with
   three days of Unasyn. Head CT from OSH negative.  H/o of alcohol abuse,
   but patient is not delirious and does not appear to be withdrawing from
   alcohol. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently. Head CT here ([**3-13**]) neg for
   acute intracranial process. There is concern also for cerebral edema in
   setting of fulminant liver failure. Will have low threshold to repeat
   head CT if mental status quickly declines or does not clear.
   - Continue ceftriaxone to cover SBP since unclear if patient had this
   on presentation to OSH.
   - Per hepatology, will perform paracentesis again today ([**3-15**])
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture (Negative for C. diff, E.
   coli O175:H7, Campy, Shigella, Salmonella, GNR; - viruses pending)
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Day (1) 4182**] [**Month/Day (1) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. First paracentesis not suggestive of SBP. EGD
   deferred by GI as hemorrhage likely from traumatic Mallencott
   placement. Hyperbilirubinemia remains stable, but will likely clear
   slowly over time.
   - follow bili and HCT - stable
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - liver consult recs: continue steroids and rifaximin, add albumin
   1g/kg x2 days, add octreotide and midodrine
   .
   #  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial, but is stable at this time. BRBPR is the most
   concerning etiology, but seems to have resolved.  Iron studies show ACD
   and baseline HCT from [**2171**] is 28.  Recent viral gastroenteritis plus
   alcohol use may have resulted in marrow supresssion.  Reticulocyte
   count of 4 from OSH argues against hemolysis and more towards marrow
   suppression. There is also concern for DIC or TTP given low fibrinogen,
   elevated PTT, and thrombocytopenia, rare schistocytes though suspect
   that these abnormalities are secondary to liver failure.   Normal LDH
   may argue against a microangiopathic anemia.  B12 and folate WNL.
   - follow hct - stable
   - f/u DIC labs
 but difficult to assess with liver failure
   - consider hematology consult if worsens
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Stable. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA.
   - Follow plt count and would transfuse as patient actively bleeding
   - transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of active bleeding
   .
   #  Diarrhea.  Patient had diarrhea prior to admission.  Concern for
   viral etiology vs. med effect (was on magnesium oxide at OSH).  C. diff
   negative at outside hospital.
   - Stool no longer grossly bloody, will titrate lactulose to BMs
   .
   # Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to ascites and LE edema. Improving.
   - Follow daily lytes
   .
   8.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   9.  H/o alcohol abuse. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently (only positive for
   subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - continue valium CIWA scale
   - continue vitamins, folate, thiamine
   - SW consult when mental status improves

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, admitted to the ICU with cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcoholism. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has been treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her abdominal tenderness has worsened, but her white blood cell count is not elevated. She also has thrombocytopenia, ascites, lower extremity edema, and hepatosplenomegaly. The patient's hyperbilirubinemia is stable, and she is being managed with lactulose to control her bowel movements. She has hyponatremia, which is improving, and her anemia is stable. There is concern for cerebral edema due to fulminant liver failure, and she may require a repeat head CT if her mental status does not clear. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to liver failure and splenomegaly, and she is being closely monitored for any signs of bleeding. Her diarrhea has improved, and her electrolytes are being closely monitored. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently on valium for alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is not clearing due to fixed obstruction"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and current admission for hepatic failure and persistent altered mental status. She has undergone extensive evaluations, including imaging, which revealed portal vein thrombosis. The working diagnosis suggests that this thrombosis may be contributing to worsening hepatic encephalopathy, along with other metabolic insults. The patient's background of alcohol abuse and chronic Tylenol use may be triggering factors. The patient is currently receiving supportive care and is being monitored for further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Treatment for hepatic encephalopathy includes lactulose and rifaximin. The patient's condition has improved with this treatment, but re-tapping of ascites may be necessary. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a potential complication of liver failure, characterized by altered mental status. It can be exacerbated by various factors, including infections, electrolyte imbalances, or medications.

2. Portal vein thrombosis: The presence of portal vein thrombosis can lead to further complications such as portal hypertension or bowel ischemia.

3. Ascites: The patient has ascites, which is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity. Re-tapping of ascites may be necessary to relieve symptoms and prevent complications such as infection or respiratory distress.

4. Infections: Patients with cirrhosis and hepatic failure are at increased risk for infections, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ("

 final read:
   1. No apparent filling defects within the main [**Year (4 digits) 4182**] [**Year (4 digits) 4244**] to suggest
   thrombosis.
   2. Findings consistent with cirrhosis including ascites, varices, and
   nodular and shrunken appearance of the liver with caudate hypertrophy.
   3. Sludge within the gallbladder, unchanged. No evidence of
   intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.
   4. Subcentimeter hypodensity within the right lobe of the liver,
   incompletely characterized on this single phase study.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**],
   clearing up the AM of [**3-15**].  Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy
   that is not clearing due to fixed [**Date Range 4182**] [**Date Range 4244**] obstruction. Also
   confounded by hyponatremia and anemia.  No clear source of infection,
   CXR negative for infiltrate.  Having abdominal tenderness B/L [**3-15**].
   Second paracentesis showed more of an SBP picture. Head CT from OSH
   negative.  H/o of alcohol abuse, but patient is not delirious and does
   not appear to be withdrawing from alcohol. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA
   currently. Head CT here ([**3-13**]) neg for acute intracranial process.
   There is concern also for cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver
   failure. Will have low threshold to repeat head CT if mental status
   quickly declines or does not clear.
   - Second paracentesis showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to
   Zosyn, per ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture (Negative for C. diff, E.
   coli O175:H7, Campy, Shigella, Salmonella, GNR; - viruses pending)
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis today as abd girth increasing
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Day (1) 4182**] [**Month/Day (1) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. First paracentesis not suggestive of SBP. EGD
   deferred by GI as hemorrhage likely from traumatic Mallencott
   placement. Hyperbilirubinemia remains stable, but will likely clear
   slowly over time.
   - follow bili
 stable at 40s
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - liver consult recs: continue steroids and rifaximin, continue albumin
   1g/kg x2 days, add octreotide and midodrine
   .
   #  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial, but is stable at this time. BRBPR is the most
   concerning etiology, but seems to have resolved.  Iron studies show ACD
   and baseline HCT from [**2171**] is 28.  Recent viral gastroenteritis plus
   alcohol use may have resulted in marrow supresssion.  Reticulocyte
   count of 4 from OSH argues against hemolysis and more towards marrow
   suppression. There is also concern for DIC or TTP given low fibrinogen,

   - consider hematology consult if worsens
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trending up from 0.8 to 3.0. UOP tapered off,
   but picked up after starting albumin infusion. FENa still <1%, so
   either prerenal hypovolemia from large stool output, ATN, although no
   recent known nephrotoxic drugs have been administered, or hepatorenal
   syndrome. If no improvement in Cr over the course of 48hrs of albumin
   therapy, then hepatorenal syndrome likely.

   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of presumed alcoholism and cirrhosis. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has undergone several diagnostic procedures, including a paracentesis, which revealed an increased white blood cell count with a left shift, indicating an infection. The patient was subsequently placed on Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 144/78 to 158/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented but exhibits slow speech.

The physical examination reveals anisocoria with a larger left pupil, scleral icterus, clear oropharynx, supple neck, regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur, distended abdomen with ascites, and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Neurological examination shows no asterixis, and the patient is alert, oriented, and responsive to commands.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, elevated bilirubin levels, thrombocytopenia with a platelet"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic, who was admitted to the ICU for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient had an initial drop in hemoglobin levels and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (RBCs). A diagnostic paracentesis was performed, removing 50cc of blood-tinged ascitic fluid, which was sent for cell count and culture. The patient was switched from ceftriaxone to zosyn for SBP treatment.

The patient's condition continues to worsen, with a declining creatinine level. Allergic reactions to medications are not reported. The patient is on multiple ICU medications, including meropenem, ceftriaxone, and zosyn. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/78 mmHg to 158/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals anisocoria with a larger left pupil, scleral icterus, clear lungs, regular heart sounds, systolic murmur, soft non-tender abdomen with distension and ascites, and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Neurological examination shows slow speech but appropriate answers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic, presenting with hepatorenal syndrome and impaired skin integrity. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to worsening renal function and hemodynamic instability.

24-hour events include a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 28.5 to 22.1, necessitating two units of packed red blood cells transfusion. A diagnostic paracentesis was performed, removing 50cc of blood-tinged ascitic fluid, which was sent for cell count and culture. The antibiotic regimen was changed from ceftriaxone to zosyn due to suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate ranging from 96-112 bpm, blood pressure between 144/78 mmHg and 93/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's rhythm remains sinusoidal.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,634 mL and output of 3,030 mL over the past 24 hours, with a positive balance of 604 mL. The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen support and has normal ABG values.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's"

   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**],
   improving daily.  Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Iniitally
   confounded by hyponatremia and anemia.  Second paracentesis showed more
   of an SBP picture, so infection also contributing. H/o of alcohol
   abuse, but [**Doctor Last Name 3869**] low on CIWA currently. Head CT from OSH negative.
   Head CT here ([**3-13**]) neg for acute intracranial process. There is
   concern also for cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure.
   Will have low threshold to repeat head CT if mental status quickly
   declines or does not clear.
   - Second paracentesis showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to
   Zosyn, per ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture (Negative for C. diff, E.
   coli O175:H7, Campy, Shigella, Salmonella, GNR; - viruses pending)
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis today as abd girth increasing
   will ask Hepatology
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Day (1) 4182**] [**Month/Day (1) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. First paracentesis not suggestive of SBP. EGD
   deferred by GI as hemorrhage likely from traumatic Mallencott
   placement. Hyperbilirubinemia remains stable, but will likely clear
   slowly over time.
   - follow bili
 stable at 40s
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - liver consult recs: continue lactulose, steroids and rifaximin,
   continue albumin 1g/kg x2 days, add octreotide and midodrine
   .
   #  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial, but is stable at this time. BRBPR is the most
   concerning etiology, but seems to have resolved.  Iron studies show ACD
   and baseline HCT from [**2171**] is 28.  Recent viral gastroenteritis plus
   alcohol use may have resulted in marrow supresssion.  Reticulocyte
   count of 4 from OSH argues against hemolysis and more towards marrow
   suppression. There is also concern for DIC or TTP given low fibrinogen,
   elevated PTT, and thrombocytopenia, rare schistocytes though suspect
   that these abnormalities are secondary to liver failure.   Normal LDH
   may argue against a microangiopathic anemia.  B12 and folate WNL.
   - follow hct
 dropped 6 pts overnight [**3-15**], transfused 2U PRBCs, HCT
   from 22.1 -> 26.5
   - Stools remain guaiac pos, but not grossly bloody
   - Will transfuse 2U FFP to reverse potential slow hemorrhage
   - Consider hematology consult if worsens
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trending up from 0.8 to 3.0. UOP tapered off,
   but picked up after starting albumin infusion. FENa still <1%, so
   either prerenal hypovolemia from large stool output, ATN, although no
   recent known nephrotoxic drugs have been administered, or hepatorenal
   syndrome. If no improvement in Cr over the course of 48hrs of albumin
   therapy, then hepatorenal syndrome likely.
   - Cont albumin 1g/kg
   - Obtain bladder pressure for obstruction as cause
   - Trend Cr
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Stable. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   #  Diarrhea.  Patient had diarrhea prior to admission.  Concern for
   viral etiology vs. med effect (was on magnesium oxide at OSH).  C. diff
   negative at outside hospital. Remains guaiac positive
   - Stool no longer grossly bloody, will titrate lactulose to BMs
   .
   # Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to ascites and LE edema. Improving.
   - Follow daily lytes
   .
   8.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   9.  H/o alcohol abuse. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently (only positive for

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and presumed secondary cirrhosis. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications including suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, hyponatremia, and lower extremity edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has AMS that is waxing and waning, likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Other contributing factors may include hyponatremia and anemia.
2. SBP: The second paracentesis showed an increased white blood cell count with a left shift, indicating an infection. The patient was switched from ceftriaxone to zosyn as per ID recommendations.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been trending up from 0.8 to 3.0, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be due to prerenal hypovolemia from large stool output, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to liver failure and splenomegaly. There is a concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thromboc"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with known history of cirrhosis anad with tylenol
   ingestion chronically has had subsequent evlution of signfiicant
   hepatic failure.  Over time she has had some improvement in mental
   status with Rx for possible SBP and with Rx for hepatic encephalopathy.
   1) HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
   -Octreotide/Midodrine/Albumin 1g/Kg
   -Did remove minimal fluid yesterday for diagnostic tap
   -Continue with support in regards to decreased SVR and inadequate
   volume intra-vascularly
   -Will need to consider central venous pressure monitoring if response
   not seen
   2)Altered Mental Status-
   -SBP
treated by Zosyn now
   -Continue Lactulose and Rifax for control of hepatic encephalopathy
   3)Portal Vein Thrombosis/Cirrhosis-
   -T. Bili remains stable and elevated
   -Continue with Steroid Rx
   -Will need to support renal function maximally

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU due to significant hepatic failure. The patient has shown some improvement in mental status after receiving treatment for possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatic encephalopathy.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: This condition is characterized by kidney failure in patients with severe liver disease. The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, and measures such as octreotide, midodrine, and albumin infusion may be necessary to manage this condition.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status may be affected by various factors, including hepatic encephalopathy. The treatment for SBP with Zosyn will help address any infection-related causes. Additionally, lactulose and rifaximin are being continued to control hepatic encephalopathy.

3. Portal Vein Thrombosis/Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which can increase the risk of portal vein thrombosis. The elevated total bilirubin levels indicate that liver function is still compromised. Steroid treatment is being considered, and it is important to support renal function maximally in this situation.

Other considerations include the need for continued ICU care, close monitoring of vital signs, and ongoing management of nutrition and glycemic control."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**],
   improving daily.  Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Iniitally
   confounded by hyponatremia and anemia.  Second paracentesis showed more
   of an SBP picture, so infection also contributing. H/o of alcohol
   abuse, but [**Doctor Last Name 3869**] low on CIWA currently. Head CT from OSH negative.
   Head CT here ([**3-13**]) neg for acute intracranial process. There is
   concern also for cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure.
   Will have low threshold to repeat head CT if mental status quickly
   declines or does not clear.
   - Second paracentesis showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to
   Zosyn, per ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture (Negative for C. diff, E.
   coli O175:H7, Campy, Shigella, Salmonella, GNR; - viruses pending)
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis today as abd girth increasing
   will ask Hepatology
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Day (1) 4182**] [**Month/Day (1) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. First paracentesis not suggestive of SBP. EGD
   deferred by GI as hemorrhage likely from traumatic Mallencott
   placement. Hyperbilirubinemia remains stable, but will likely clear
   slowly over time.
   - follow bili
 stable at 40s
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - liver consult recs: continue lactulose, steroids and rifaximin,
   continue albumin 1g/kg x2 days, add octreotide and midodrine
   .
   #  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial, but is stable at this time. BRBPR is the most
   concerning etiology, but seems to have resolved.  Iron studies show ACD
   and baseline HCT from [**2171**] is 28.  Recent viral gastroenteritis plus
   alcohol use may have resulted in marrow supresssion.  Reticulocyte
   count of 4 from OSH argues against hemolysis and more towards marrow
   suppression. There is also concern for DIC or TTP given low fibrinogen,
   elevated PTT, and thrombocytopenia, rare schistocytes though suspect
   that these abnormalities are secondary to liver failure.   Normal LDH
   may argue against a microangiopathic anemia.  B12 and folate WNL.
   - follow hct
 dropped 6 pts overnight [**3-15**], transfused 2U PRBCs, HCT
   from 22.1 -> 26.5
   - Stools remain guaiac pos, but not grossly bloody
   - Will transfuse 2U FFP to reverse potential slow hemorrhage
   - Consider hematology consult if worsens
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trending up from 0.8 to 3.0. UOP tapered off,
   but picked up after starting albumin infusion. FENa still <1%, so
   either prerenal hypovolemia from large stool output, ATN, although no
   recent known nephrotoxic drugs have been administered, or hepatorenal
   syndrome. If no improvement in Cr over the course of 48hrs of albumin
   therapy, then hepatorenal syndrome likely.
   - Cont albumin 1g/kg
   - Obtain bladder pressure for obstruction as cause
   - Trend Cr
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Stable. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   #  Diarrhea.  Patient had diarrhea prior to admission.  Concern for
   viral etiology vs. med effect (was on magnesium oxide at OSH).  C. diff
   negative at outside hospital. Remains guaiac positive
   - Stool no longer grossly bloody, will titrate lactulose to BMs
   .
   # Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to ascites and LE edema. Improving.
   - Follow daily lytes
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently (only positive for
   subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - continue valium CIWA scale
   - continue vitamins, folate, thiamine
   - SW consult when mental status improves

- Her altered mental status is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy, with initial confusion due to hyponatremia and anemia. Infection is also contributing to the altered mental status.
- There is concern for cerebral edema in the setting of fulminant liver failure.
- The patient had a second paracentesis showing increased white blood cell count with left shift, and antibiotics were changed to Zosyn based on ID recommendations.
- Blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures are pending.
- Lactulose was started to manage hepatic encephalopathy, and the dosage will be titrated to three bowel movements per day.
- Consideration for therapeutic paracentesis is being given due to increasing abdominal girth.
- The patient has mild transaminitis, stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, lower extremity edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.
- This is likely secondary to cirrhosis from alcoholism with potential embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen use.
- The patient's hyperbilirubinemia is stable but will likely clear slowly over time.
- Anemia etiology is unclear and likely multifactorial,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Patient has AMS that is waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**],
   improving daily.  Likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Iniitally
   confounded by hyponatremia and anemia.  Second paracentesis showed more
   of an SBP picture, so infection also contributing. H/o of alcohol
   abuse, but [**Doctor Last Name 3869**] low on CIWA currently. Head CT from OSH negative.
   Head CT here ([**3-13**]) neg for acute intracranial process. There is
   concern also for cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure.
   Will have low threshold to repeat head CT if mental status quickly
   declines or does not clear.
   - Second paracentesis showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to
   Zosyn, per ID recs
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum, stool culture (Negative for C. diff, E.
   coli O175:H7, Campy, Shigella, Salmonella, GNR; - viruses pending)
   - lactulose -> titrate to [**3-3**] BMs per day
   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis today as abd girth increasing
   will ask Hepatology
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Day (1) 4182**] [**Month/Day (1) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. First paracentesis not suggestive of SBP. EGD
   deferred by GI as hemorrhage likely from traumatic Mallencott
   placement. Hyperbilirubinemia remains stable, but will likely clear
   slowly over time.
   - follow bili
 stable at 40s
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - liver consult recs: continue lactulose, steroids and rifaximin,
   continue albumin 1g/kg x2 days, add octreotide and midodrine
   .
   #  Anemia.  Etiology of profound anemia is unclear and likely
   multifactorial, but is stable at this time. BRBPR is the most
   concerning etiology, but seems to have resolved.  Iron studies show ACD
   and baseline HCT from [**2171**] is 28.  Recent viral gastroenteritis plus
   alcohol use may have resulted in marrow supresssion.  Reticulocyte
   count of 4 from OSH argues against hemolysis and more towards marrow
   suppression. There is also concern for DIC or TTP given low fibrinogen,
   elevated PTT, and thrombocytopenia, rare schistocytes though suspect
   that these abnormalities are secondary to liver failure.   Normal LDH
   may argue against a microangiopathic anemia.  B12 and folate WNL.
   - follow hct
 dropped 6 pts overnight [**3-15**], transfused 2U PRBCs, HCT
   from 22.1 -> 26.5
   - Stools remain guaiac pos, but not grossly bloody
   - Will transfuse 2U FFP to reverse potential slow hemorrhage
   - Consider hematology consult if worsens
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trending up from 0.8 to 3.0. UOP tapered off,
   but picked up after starting albumin infusion. FENa still <1%, so
   either prerenal hypovolemia from large stool output, ATN, although no
   recent known nephrotoxic drugs have been administered, or hepatorenal
   syndrome. If no improvement in Cr over the course of 48hrs of albumin
   therapy, then hepatorenal syndrome likely.
   - Cont albumin 1g/kg
   - Obtain bladder pressure for obstruction as cause
   - Trend Cr
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Stable. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   #  Diarrhea.  Patient had diarrhea prior to admission.  Concern for
   viral etiology vs. med effect (was on magnesium oxide at OSH).  C. diff
   negative at outside hospital. Remains guaiac positive
   - Stool no longer grossly bloody, will titrate lactulose to BMs
   .
   # Hyponatremia.  Likely secondary to ascites and LE edema. Improving.
   - Follow daily lytes
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. [**Doctor Last Name **] low on CIWA currently (only positive for
   subjective feelings of anxiety).
   - continue valium CIWA scale
   - continue vitamins, folate, thiamine
   - SW consult when mental status improves

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of presumed secondary alcoholism, presenting with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinemia, thrombosis, and complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has altered mental status likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. There is concern for cerebral edema in the setting of fulminant liver failure. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored, and a low threshold to repeat head CT if mental status quickly declines or does not clear.

2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The second paracentesis showed an increased white blood cell count with left shift, indicating SBP. The patient was changed to Zosyn per ID recommendations. Close monitoring for signs of infection and follow-up cultures are necessary.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been trending up from 0.8 to 3.0. The cause of acute renal failure may be prerenal hypovolemia from large stool output, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or hepatorenal syndrome. Albumin therapy has been initiated, and the patient's response will be closely monitored. If"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver and alcohol abuse, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is anemia and hemolytic anemia. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate 117 bpm (with a sinus tachycardia rhythm), blood pressure 140/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's history of cirrhosis and the presence of hepatorenal syndrome indicate compromised liver function, which can lead to renal dysfunction. This condition requires careful monitoring and management of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and renal function.

2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity is not assessed in the progress note, indicating a potential risk for pressure ulcers or infections. Proper skin care and frequent repositioning should be implemented to prevent further complications.

3. Anemia and Hemolytic Anemia: The patient has a documented history of anemia and hemolytic anemia. It is important to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, and blood cell counts regularly to assess the severity and progression of anemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   hypernatremic (suspect tube feeds)
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifampin (currently stooling well)
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/p diagnostic paracentesis -  Second
   tap showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn, per informal ID
   recs
   - Cultures NGTD
   - f/u pending cultures
   - Will not do therapeutic para per liver recs, since bladder pressure
   is not elevated.
   .
   #  Anemia: likely multifactorial. Baseline anemia of chronic disease,
   with low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not grossly bloody), and
   likely bleeding into the abdomen, causing the drop in hematocrit.
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, higher if actively bleeding. Will give FFP today to curtail the
   bleeding and reverse coagulopathy
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - Check RBC morphologies (showed rare schistocytes in the past) for
   ?hemolysis (but low retic index, direct bilirubinemia and normal LDH
   argues against this)
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI as guaiac pos stools may
   be from traumatic rectal tube placement.
   - Bili rising.
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per liver.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Stable. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W, encourage PO free water, flush with free water in
   between TF
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs (appreciate
   it!), ISS

   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to alcoholism. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical complications including hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and lower extremity edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: This is a potential complication of liver cirrhosis, characterized by altered mental status. The patient's waxing and waning alertness, along with the head CT findings, suggest hepatic encephalopathy.

2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): SBP is a common and potentially life-threatening complication in patients with cirrhosis. The patient has received Unasyn for SBP prophylaxis and Ceftriaxone upon arrival at the hospital. Diagnostic paracentesis showed an increased white blood cell count with a left shift, leading to a change in antibiotic therapy to Zosyn.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.8 to 3.0, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to hypovolemia caused by large stool output or hepatorenal syndrome. The improvement in creatinine after albumin infusion suggests that it may not"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with history of cirrhosis and now admit with hepatic
   failure in the setting of tylenol use and with course complicated by
   likely portan vein thrombosis noted on U/S but not confirmed on CT
   scan.  In this setting she has had fluctuation in mental status and
   with concerning findings of anemia with some response to transfusion
   but with continued increase in T. Bili
   1)Renal Failure-- HEPATORENAL SYNDROME vs. Pre-renal azotemia
   suspected-  Has had favorable trend in Cr with improved volume
   delivered through albumin
   -Follow Cr
   -Urine output improved
   2)Altered Mental Status-
   -Continue with treatment for hepatic encephalopathy
   -Minimize sedating medications
   -Rx renal failure
   3)Hyperbilirubinemia/Cirrhosis-
   -Continue to follow
   -Steroids stopped
   -Will fractionate bilirubin as needed but is dominant direct bilirubin
   at this time which is consistent with intra-hepatic cholestasis with
   normal Alk/Phos.
   4)Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis-
   -Continue with Zosyn
   5)Anemia
Does have acute decrease in HCT.  No evidence of active GI
   tract blood loss.  [**Month (only) 11**] be bleeding at site of paracentesis and
   intra-abdominal but not clearly confirmed on previous tap.
   -Transfuse as needed
   -Repeat para is source needed to be confirmed
   -Will evaluate for possible hemolysis if further decline seen
   -Will work with FFP to look to normalize PT for 24 hours to minimize
   bleeding

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, admitted with hepatic failure due to Tylenol use. She has been experiencing fluctuating mental status and anemia with a response to transfusion. There are concerning findings of an increased total bilirubin level. The patient also has suspected renal failure, possibly hepatorenal syndrome or pre-renal azotemia, which showed a favorable trend in creatinine with improved volume delivery through albumin. The patient's altered mental status is being treated for hepatic encephalopathy, minimizing sedating medications, and addressing renal failure. The patient's hyperbilirubinemia and cirrhosis are being monitored, and steroids have been stopped. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is being treated with Zosyn. Anemia is present, with an acute decrease in hematocrit but no evidence of active gastrointestinal tract blood loss. The patient is on nutrition support and has been given blood transfusions as needed. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic (suspect tube feeds)
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifampin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/p diagnostic paracentesis -  Second
   tap showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn, per informal ID
   recs
   - Cultures NGTD
   - f/u pending cultures
   - Will not do therapeutic para per liver recs, since bladder pressure
   is not elevated.
   .
   #  Anemia: likely multifactorial. Baseline anemia of chronic disease,
   with low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not grossly bloody), and
   likely bleeding into the abdomen, causing the drop in hematocrit.
   Unlikely that the patient is hemolyzing, since lab data underwhelming -
   low retic index, direct bilirubinemia and normal LDH
   - Recheck retic index, hemolysis labs
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, higher if actively bleeding. Will treat with aggressive FFP to
   Will give FFP today to curtail the bleeding and reverse coagulopathy
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - Check RBC morphologies (showed rare schistocytes in the past) for
   ?hemolysis (but low retic index, direct bilirubinemia and normal LDH
   argues against this)
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI as guaiac pos stools may
   be from traumatic rectal tube placement.
   - Bili rising.
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per liver.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Stable. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W, encourage PO free water, flush with free water in

","Summary:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcoholism, presenting with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
- She has a history of alcohol abuse and completed 5 days of high-dose thiamine.
- The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- She is also experiencing acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and lower extremity edema.
- The patient's condition is complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including liver, kidney, and hematological abnormalities.
- She has undergone several interventions, including blood product transfusions, antibiotic therapy, and supportive care measures.
- The patient's prognosis is guarded due to the severity and complexity of her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could progress to more severe hepatic encephalopathy, leading to increased confusion, disorientation, and potential development of coma.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient's SBP may worsen or recur, causing abdominal pain, fever, and increased ascites.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, leading to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially requiring dialysis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   hypernatremic (suspect tube feeds)
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifampin (currently stooling well)
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/p diagnostic paracentesis -  Second
   tap showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn, per informal ID
   recs
   - Cultures NGTD
   - f/u pending cultures
   - Will not do therapeutic para per liver recs, since bladder pressure
   is not elevated.
   .
   #  Anemia: likely multifactorial. Baseline anemia of chronic disease,
   with low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not grossly bloody), and
   likely bleeding into the abdomen, causing the drop in hematocrit.
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, higher if actively bleeding. Will give FFP today to curtail the
   bleeding and reverse coagulopathy
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - Check RBC morphologies (showed rare schistocytes in the past) for
   ?hemolysis (but low retic index, direct bilirubinemia and normal LDH
   argues against this)
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI as guaiac pos stools may
   be from traumatic rectal tube placement.
   - Bili rising.
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per liver.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Stable. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W, encourage PO free water, flush with free water in
   between TF
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs (appreciate
   it!), ISS

2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has received Unasyn for SBP prophylaxis and was started on ceftriaxone upon arrival. SBP is a potential complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has risen from 0.8 to a peak of 3.0. This indicates acute renal failure, which can be caused by hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to liver failure and splenomegaly. Close monitoring of platelet count is necessary, and transfusion may be required if the platelet count drops"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver and alcohol abuse. They were admitted to the ICU with hepatorenal syndrome, impaired skin integrity, and hemolytic anemia. The patient received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to a low hematocrit (Hct) level of 25%. They also received two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for coagulopathy with an initial international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0, which improved to 2.4 after receiving two units of thrombocytes at 10 pm. Hepatology interventions include restarting N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and adjusting vancomycin doses based on levels. The patient underwent a kidney/urinary bladder (KUB) examination, which showed ascites without evidence of obstruction or ileus. Nutrition plans involve continuing multivitamins and minerals, changing total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to Novasource Renal with a goal rate of 30 mL/hr. If the patient continues to have high residuals, they will advance tube feeding past the pylorus. Allergies were not reported. The patient received antibiotics including meropenem, ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin on different dates. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/48 to 145/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with total intake exceeding output. The patient's blood products and urine output are within normal limits. Respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 96% and an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of ///28/. Physical examination findings include sinus tachycardia, unassessed peripheral vascular pulses, and not assessed skin, neurologic, and abdominal examination. Laboratory results show elevated potassium levels (39 K/uL), low hemoglobin (9.8 g/dL), high white blood cell count (10.0), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, elevated liver enzymes, and other abnormalities. The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver and alcohol abuse, while their review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is pending further evaluation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome progression leading to worsening renal function.
2. Impaired skin integrity and potential development of pressure ulcers.
3. Hemolytic anemia requiring further management and monitoring.
4. Coagul"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic (suspect tube feeds)
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifampin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/p diagnostic paracentesis -  Second
   tap showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn, per informal ID
   recs
   - Cultures NGTD
   - f/u pending cultures
   - Will not do therapeutic para per liver recs, since bladder pressure
   is not elevated.
   .
   #  Anemia: likely multifactorial. Baseline anemia of chronic disease,
   with low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not grossly bloody), and
   likely bleeding into the abdomen, causing the drop in hematocrit.
   Unlikely that the patient is hemolyzing, since lab data underwhelming -
   low retic index, direct bilirubinemia and normal LDH
   - Recheck retic index, hemolysis labs
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, higher if actively bleeding. Will treat with aggressive FFP
   transfusions to curtail bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels that hct drop is
   more likely due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per liver. Will give another dose of albumin 1g/kg per liver
   recs today
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Stable. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Increase free water flushes to 200cc Q4hrs
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of presumed secondary cirrhosis due to alcoholism. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She received Unasyn for SBP prophylaxis and was started on ceftriaxone upon arrival.

The patient has a baseline anemia of chronic disease, low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding, and bleeding into the abdomen. She will be treated supportively with blood products, aiming for a hematocrit (Hct) of 21 if stable, higher if actively bleeding. Aggressive fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions will be given to curtail bleeding.

The patient also has hyperbilirubinemia, thrombosis, ascites, lower extremity edema, and elevated INR. These symptoms are likely secondary to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen use. She is not currently drinking, per the patient and her husband.

The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine (Cr) level that increased from 0.8 to a peak of 3.0. The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is less than 1%, indicating pre-renal azotemia due to hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. The Cr improved after an albumin infusion, suggesting"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with history of cirrhosis and now with hepatic failure in
   the setting of Tylenol ingestion chronically and with persistent
   altered mental status consistent with enceophalopathy.  She has some
   persistent anemia with possible sources led by hemolysis or blood loss
   acutely with intraperitoneal perhaps most likely.
   1)Altered Mental Status-
   -Will continue to support
   -Vanco/Zosyn for possible SBP as source
   -Will continue with lactulose/Rifax and minimize any sedating
   medications
   -Patient with slow trend to better, but
   -need to normalize increased Na+
   2)Cirrhosis
Prognosis discussed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 416**] and team with patient
   -Will continue to support renal function with volume and
   -Midodrine/Octreotide
   3)Anemia-Certainly hemolysis is possible.  Additional concern is for
   ongoing blood loss into peritoneal cavity in the setting of recent
   procedure and coagulopathy.  Blood loss into GI tract is possible but
   less likely.  Will
   -Check hemolysis labs in follow up
Retic index
   -Occasional shistocytes
   -continue to check HCT q 8 hours
   -Follow abdominal exam and favor diagnostic tap if intervention desired
   as previous tap was with >100,000 RBC
will normalize INR to work to
   stop bleeding.
   -Will have to follow volume status
   4)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Improved renal function with support of perfusion both with volume and
   SVR management with octreotide and Midodrine
   -Continue with adjustment in medication dosing
   -Favor D/C of Midodrine/Octreotide if GI in agreement

","The patient's chief complaints are hepatic failure, anemia, and altered mental status consistent with encephalopathy. The patient has a history of cirrhosis and chronic Tylenol ingestion, which may have contributed to the hepatic failure. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, sinus tachycardia, and slightly elevated blood pressure. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with a SpO2 of 97%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals several abnormalities including dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds in the chest, distended and tender abdomen, and absent peripheral pulses in both extremities. Neurologically, the patient follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli but movement, tone, and skin assessments were not performed.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL and a hematocrit of 28.5%. The platelet count is low at 32,000/mm3. Liver function tests show elevated levels of ALT and AST, while kidney function tests reveal elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results indicate electrolyte imbalances, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal cardiac markers.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of altered mental status, cirrhosis, anemia, and acute renal failure. Treatment involves supportive care, including lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy, antibiotics for possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP),"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholic anemia, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient received 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and has shown an increase in hematocrit (HCT) from 24 to 29 without receiving any red blood cell transfusions. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/98 to 143/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple medications including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,010 mL and output of 2,990 mL, with urine output of 1,790 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, kidney dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome and impaired skin integrity. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatorenal syndrome: This condition involves the worsening of kidney function due to severe liver disease. It can lead to acute kidney injury and may require dialysis.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic (suspect tube feeds)
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifampin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/p diagnostic paracentesis -  Second
   tap showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn, per informal ID
   recs
   - Cultures NGTD
   - f/u pending cultures
 all NGTD thusfar
   - Will not do therapeutic para per liver recs, since bladder pressure
   is not elevated.
   .
   #  Anemia: likely multifactorial, but improving with FFP. Baseline
   anemia of chronic disease, with low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos,
   not grossly bloody), and likely bleeding into the abdomen, causing the
   drop in hematocrit. Unlikely that the patient is hemolyzing, since lab
   data underwhelming - low retic index, direct bilirubinemia and normal
   LDH
   - Recheck retic index, hemolysis labs pending
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, higher if actively bleeding. Will treat with aggressive FFP
   transfusions to curtail bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels that hct drop is
   more likely due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable to decreasing
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per liver.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Bladder pressure today
 if elevated, perform paracentesis, if not
   elevated cont albumin
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improving. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Increase free water flushes to 200cc Q4hrs
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).
   .
   Access: PIV
 need to be changed, PICC (placed [**3-19**])

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcoholism.
- She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
- The patient has been treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatic encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- She has shown improvements in her blood count and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient's renal function has improved after albumin infusion.
- Her electrolyte imbalance has been addressed, and she is now hypernatremic.
- The patient has edema in her lower extremities, which is likely related to liver failure.
- She has a history of alcohol abuse and has completed high-dose thiamine treatment.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status suggests hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can lead to worsening of neurological symptoms and potential coma if not managed properly.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has been treated for SBP, which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis. SBP can progress to sepsis and multi-organ failure if not promptly treated.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anemia and low-grade positive stool guaiac test indicate gastrointestinal bleeding"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic (suspect tube feeds)
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifampin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/p diagnostic paracentesis -  Second
   tap showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn, per informal ID
   recs
   - Cultures NGTD
   - f/u pending cultures
 all NGTD thusfar
   - Will not do therapeutic para per liver recs, since bladder pressure
   is not elevated.
   .
   #  Anemia: likely multifactorial, but improving with FFP. Baseline
   anemia of chronic disease, with low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos,
   not grossly bloody), and likely bleeding into the abdomen, causing the
   drop in hematocrit. Unlikely that the patient is hemolyzing, since lab
   data underwhelming - low retic index, direct bilirubinemia and normal
   LDH
   - Recheck retic index, hemolysis labs pending
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, higher if actively bleeding. Will treat with aggressive FFP
   transfusions to curtail bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels that hct drop is
   more likely due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable to decreasing
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per liver.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improving. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Increase free water flushes to 200cc Q4hrs
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, presenting with cirrhosis, anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of her condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/98 mmHg to 107/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals anisocoria with a larger left pupil, scleral icterus, clear lung fields, regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur, distended abdomen with ascites, and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and renal dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and hyperbilirubinemia suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can be exacerbated by factors such as infection or gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has received prophylactic antibiotics for SBP, which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.
3. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient's positive stool guaiac test indicates the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholic hepatitis, who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has been receiving various medications including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/98 to 143/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the presence of anisocoria with a larger left pupil. Physical examination findings include supple neck, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur, soft abdomen with tenderness and distension, positive pitting edema in both lower extremities, and alert neurologic status. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low hemoglobin, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal kidney function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's history of cirrhosis and the presence of renal dysfunction may increase the risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure seen in advanced liver disease.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's positive pitting edema and history"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with history of cirrhosis and concerning evolution of
   anemia who now has had some improvement in mental status across time
   with treatment for hepatic source of encephaolopathy, stabilization of
   renal function and continued stability of HCT through to today.
   Remaining challenges include persistent hypernatremia.
   1)Altered Mental Status-Improved with treatment of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   -Continue lactulose/Rifaxamin
   -Follow exam
   -OOB to chair today
   -SBP Rx with Vanco Zosyn for possible resistant organism evolving on
   CTX
   -Hypernatremia to be Rx with free water bolus
   2)Renal Failure- Likely  HEPATORENAL SYNDROME contribution but very
   volume responsive.  Concerning rise in Cr is seen.
   -Will check bladder pressure
   -Will tap 1 liter for Pressure >25
   -Continue to use albumin as needed
   -Continue Octreotide/Midodrine
   3)Anemia--Persistent and actually improving as coagulopathy has been
   addressed and is likely related to what may well be decreased rate of
   blood loss in the setting of poor marrow response as evidenced by
   inappropriately low retic count.
   -Continue HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -Will tolerate INR elevation if not actively bleeding

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, currently admitted to the ICU for hepatic encephalopathy and suspected hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status, which has improved with treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Other challenges include persistent hypernatremia, renal failure (likely hepatorenal syndrome), and anemia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), current temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/63 mmHg to 136/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin concentration improving from 22.1% to 29.0%, platelet count within normal range, creatinine levels increasing from 1.2 to 2.0 mg/dL, blood glucose levels fluctuating between 134 and 187 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hypernatremia.

Imaging reveals persistent low lung volumes and increased pulmonary infiltrates bilaterally. The patient has a PICC line and nasogastric tube in good position.

The plan includes continuing lactulose/Rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, following"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic (suspect tube feeds)
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifampin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/p diagnostic paracentesis -  Second
   tap showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn, per informal ID
   recs
   - Cultures NGTD
   - f/u pending cultures
 all NGTD thusfar
   - Will not do therapeutic para per liver recs, since bladder pressure
   is not elevated.
   .
   #  Anemia: likely multifactorial, but improving with FFP. Baseline
   anemia of chronic disease, with low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos,
   not grossly bloody), and likely bleeding into the abdomen, causing the
   drop in hematocrit. Unlikely that the patient is hemolyzing, since lab
   data underwhelming - low retic index, direct bilirubinemia and normal
   LDH
   - Recheck retic index, hemolysis labs pending
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, higher if actively bleeding. Will treat with aggressive FFP
   transfusions to curtail bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels that hct drop is
   more likely due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable to decreasing
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per liver.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Bladder pressure today
 if elevated, perform paracentesis, if not
   elevated cont albumin
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improving. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Increase free water flushes to 200cc Q4hrs
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of presumed alcoholism and cirrhosis. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She is also experiencing acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and lower extremity edema.

The patient's initial hyponatremia was likely due to ascites and lower extremity edema. However, she has now developed hypernatremia, which is suspected to be caused by tube feeds. Her bladder pressure is not elevated, so therapeutic paracentesis is not recommended at this time.

The patient's anemia is likely multifactorial, including baseline anemia of chronic disease, low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding, and bleeding into the abdomen. She has been transfused with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to address the bleeding and improve her hematocrit levels.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to liver failure and splenomegaly. An evaluation for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is difficult to interpret due to liver failure. However, rare schistocytes on smear with elevated partial thromb"

   Microbiology: No new positive results
   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with cirrhosis now presenting with hepatic failure in the
   setting of increased Tylenol intake.
   1)Altered Mental Status-
   -Continue Rifax/Lactulose
   -Follow Exam
   2)Ascites-This has shown significant increase in abdominal distention
   with significant concern for continued bleeding into peritoneal space.
   This is in evidence by continued need for transfusion without evidence
   of hemolysis or alternative source of blood loss.  Significant efforts
   have been made to normalize INR but has not been able to be
   accomplished despite large volumes of FFP.  On ultrasound there is
   clear evidence of increased fluid noted and patient has significant
   dyspnea all combined with increases in bladder pressure raise the issue
   of therapeutic paracentesis.
   -Will tap for 2-3 liters today
   -Will provide albumin peri-procedure to assure adequate volume
   -Indication is related to respiratory distress
   3) ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)-
   -Concerning for possible blood loss into peritoneum
   -HCT q 6 hours today
   4)SBP-
   -Continue vanco/zosyn
   5)Acute Renal Failure--HEPATORENAL SYNDROME and PRE-RENAL CAUSES
   -Creatinine normalized to 1.0 with volume replacement
   -Will continue with midodrine/octreotide to avoid worsening related to
   cirrhosis
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presenting with hepatic failure in the setting of increased Tylenol intake. She has altered mental status, ascites, anemia secondary to blood loss, suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and acute renal failure due to hepatorenal syndrome and pre-renal causes. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been transfused with 4 units of blood due to decreased hematocrit (HCT). Her bladder pressure has increased to 33 cm H2O, indicating significant fluid accumulation in the abdomen. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and abnormal coagulation profile, which suggests liver dysfunction. An ultrasound revealed a large volume of free-flowing fluid in the abdomen, consistent with ascites. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and therapeutic paracentesis is planned to relieve respiratory distress caused by the ascites. Additional interventions, as noted in the housestaff note, need to be addressed. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently admitted to the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic anemia, and hemolytic anemia, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent paracentesis due to high bladder pressure, resulting in grossly bloody fluid with a hematocrit (hct) of 8. The liver recs recommended continuing fresh frozen plasma (FFP), CT abdomen, and considering surgery. However, the patient was determined not to be a surgical candidate and would likely die if operated on. The patient also received platelets and FFP transfusions. The CT abdomen revealed a dense material layering in the posterior peritoneal cavity, along with a 1 cm high-attenuation spot on the parietal peritoneum, which may indicate a bleeding vessel from the prior paracentesis. The patient's hct decreased, so he received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), two units of FFP, and then another unit of PRBCs and one pack of platelets due to ongoing bleeding. The patient's fluid balance has shown a negative balance, indicating ongoing fluid losses. The patient is receiving free water flushes every four hours. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is tachycardic and hypotensive. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results show respiratory acidosis. The patient's peripheral vascular examination is not assess"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt
   increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic.  Therapeutic para done [**2-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Cultures NGTD. F/U pending Cx.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely multifactorial. Baseline anemia of chronic disease,
   low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not grossly bloody), and
   evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding on paracentesis, CT scan. Unlikely
   that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low
   retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.
   Patient dropped hct again on [**3-19**] and received 4 more units of PRBCs.
   Per surgery, not operative candidate. Received 2U PRBCs, 4U FFP, 1plt
   yesterday/overnight.
   - q6h Hct/INR check.
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   Will also treat with aggressive FFP transfusions to curtail bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - F/U peritoneal amylase level for pancreatitis /intestinal
   perforation.
   - Will re-discuss with surgery as patient continues to bleed despite
   aggressive medical tx x 3days.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow
   in the [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more
   likely due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable to decreasing
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per hepatology.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Holding albumin per hepatology.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improving. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH
   normal, arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against
   TTP/HUS. Received 1U platelets overnight.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   abdominal bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Increase free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs.
   - Recheck Na this afternoon and consider starting D5W if Na not fully
   corrected by then.
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use.
- She presented with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
- The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- She received Unasyn for SBP prophylaxis and ceftriaxone upon arrival at the ICU.
- A therapeutic paracentesis was performed to remove 2.5L of grossly bloody fluid due to elevated bladder pressure and discomfort.
- The patient has evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding on paracentesis and CT scan.
- She has been receiving blood products and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions due to ongoing bleeding and a goal hemoglobin (Hct) of 21.
- The patient has mild transaminitis (stable), stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, lower extremity edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.
- She has a history of alcohol abuse and completed 5 days of high-dose thiamine.
- The patient's renal function has improved after albumin infusion, which argues against hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
- Her thrombocytopenia is improving and is likely secondary to liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic (suspect tube feeds)
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**],
   patient appears increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic.  Therapeutic
   para done [**2-20**] to remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Cultures NGTD
   - f/u pending cultures
 all NGTD thus far.
   .
   # Anemia: likely multifactorial, but Hct stabilizes w/ FFP. Baseline
   anemia of chronic disease, low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not
   grossly bloody), and evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding by
   paracentesis, CT scan. Unlikely that the patient has DIC/hemolysis,
   since lab data underwhelming - low retic index, direct bilirubinemia,
   normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.  Patient dropped hct again on [**3-19**] and
   received 4 more units of PRBCs.  Per surgery, not operative candidate.
   Received 2U PRBCs, 4U FFP, 1plt yesterday/overnight.
   - Check hct q8h.
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, higher if actively bleeding. Will treat with aggressive FFP
   transfusions to curtail bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - F/U peritoneal amylase level for pancreatitis /intestinal
   perforation.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more likely
   due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable to decreasing
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per hepatology.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Holding albumin per hepatology.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improving. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   Received 1U platelets overnight.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Increase free water flushes to 250cc Q4hrs
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcoholism, presenting with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient underwent a therapeutic paracentesis to remove 2.5 liters of grossly bloody fluid due to elevated bladder pressure and discomfort. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has developed SBP, which is a bacterial infection of the ascitic fluid. She received ceftriaxone and later switched to Zosyn, an antibiotic recommended by infectious disease consultants. Cultures are pending.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia that is likely multifactorial, including baseline anemia of chronic disease, low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding, and evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding. Blood products, including packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets, have been transfused to manage the anemia and control bleeding.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a peak creatinine level of 3.0. The cause is likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic (suspect tube feeds)
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**],
   patient appears increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic.  Therapeutic
   para done [**2-20**] to remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Cultures NGTD
   - f/u pending cultures
 all NGTD thus far.
   .
   # Anemia: likely multifactorial, but Hct stabilizes w/ FFP. Baseline
   anemia of chronic disease, low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not
   grossly bloody), and evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding by
   paracentesis, CT scan. Unlikely that the patient has DIC/hemolysis,
   since lab data underwhelming - low retic index, direct bilirubinemia,
   normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.  Patient dropped hct again on [**3-19**] and
   received 4 more units of PRBCs.  Per surgery, not operative candidate.
   Received 2U PRBCs, 4U FFP, 1plt yesterday/overnight.
   - q6h Hct/INR check.
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, higher if actively bleeding. Will treat with aggressive FFP
   transfusions to curtail bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - F/U peritoneal amylase level for pancreatitis /intestinal
   perforation.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more likely
   due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable to decreasing
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per hepatology.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Holding albumin per hepatology.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improving. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   Received 1U platelets overnight.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Increase free water flushes to 250cc Q4hrs
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).
   .
   Access: PIV, PICC (placed [**3-19**])

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcoholism presenting with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with cirrhosis, likely secondary to alcoholism, and is showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis due to elevated bladder pressure and removal of grossly bloody fluid. Cultures were obtained from the NG tube and pending. The patient's anemia is multifactorial, including baseline anemia of chronic disease, low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding, and evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding. The patient received blood products, including red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets.

The patient also has hypernatremia, which may be related to tube feeds. Hyponatremia was initially present but has now resolved. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level peaking at 3.0. The patient's thrombocytopenia is improving and is likely secondary to liver failure and splenomegaly.

Other issues include lower extremity edema, which is likely related to liver failure, and a history of alcohol abuse. The patient has completed high-dose thiamine therapy.

Prophylactic measures have been taken for pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism here with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic (suspect tube feeds)
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**],
   patient appears increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic.  Therapeutic
   para done [**2-20**] to remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Cultures NGTD
   - f/u pending cultures
 all NGTD thus far.
   .
   # Anemia: likely multifactorial, but Hct stabilizes w/ FFP. Baseline
   anemia of chronic disease, low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not
   grossly bloody), and evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding by
   paracentesis, CT scan. Unlikely that the patient has DIC/hemolysis,
   since lab data underwhelming - low retic index, direct bilirubinemia,
   normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.  Patient dropped hct again on [**3-19**] and
   received 4 more units of PRBCs.  Per surgery, not operative candidate.
   Received 2U PRBCs, 4U FFP, 1plt yesterday/overnight.
   - q6h Hct/INR check.
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, higher if actively bleeding. Will treat with aggressive FFP
   transfusions to curtail bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - F/U peritoneal amylase level for pancreatitis /intestinal
   perforation.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient had
   mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE edema,
   hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen
   use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and husband.
   [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in the
   [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more likely
   due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable to decreasing
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per hepatology.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Holding albumin per hepatology.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improving. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  And evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   Received 1U platelets overnight.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or signs of brisk bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Increase free water flushes to 250cc Q4hrs
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of presumed alcohol-induced cirrhosis. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient was initially hyponatremic but has now developed hypernatremia, likely due to tube feeds. She has evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding, low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding, and thrombosis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Head CT should be repeated if there is suspicion of cerebral edema in the setting of fulminant liver failure. Continue lactulose and rifaximin. Treat hypernatremia as below.
2. SBP: The patient received Unasyn for 3 days at OSH for SBP prophylaxis. She was started on ceftriaxone upon arrival here. A diagnostic paracentesis showed an increased white blood cell count with a left shift, and CTX was changed to Zosyn on 3/15.
3. Anemia: The anemia is likely multifactorial, with causes including baseline anemia of chronic disease, low-grade GI bleed, and evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding. It is unlikely that the patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)/hemolysis. The patient received 4 more units of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has had multiple complications including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver failure.
2. SBP: The patient has developed SBP, which is a bacterial infection of the ascitic fluid. It can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
3. GIB: There is evidence of low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be related to portal hypertension or esophageal varices.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which could be caused by hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, likely due to liver failure and splenomegaly.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient initially had hyponatremia but has now developed hypernatremia. This could be due to free water loss through diarrhea or TF.
7. Ascites: The patient has tense abdomen with distention"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with history of cirrhosis and now admit with decompensated
   liver failure and now with transient acute renal failure and with some
   rapid improvement with volume support and continued Rx for HRS possible
   contribution.  The current and persistent active issue is really around
   persistent anemia secondary to blood loss with Paracentesis and CT
   consistent wtih intra-peritoneal bleeding with suggestion or parietal
   surface vessel as source of continued blood loss.  This blood loss is
   in the setting of coagulopathy which is related to underlying liver
   disease.  We have attempted to correct coagulopathy with FFP but have
   been unable to complete.  It is certainly possible that hemo-peritoneum
   is related to previous procedure with paracentesis related injury to
   parietal peritoneum leading to bleed. She has had continued 3 units/day
   transufion requirement.
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)-
   -Will discuss with surgery and possible interventions to stabilize
   bleeding
   -FFP attempted with minimal change in bleeding rate
   -Will look to peritoneal amylase today
   -Given need for exploratory laparotomy to identify source of bleed
risk
   of surgery is certainly excessive at this time given risk for recurrent
   or persistent bleeding following intervention.
   -Will need to work to normalize coags
   2)Cirrhosis-
   -Continue to Rx for hepatic encephaolopathy with Lactulose/Rifax
   -Correct coags if possible given ongoing bleeding
   -Substantial improvement in respiratory status with paracentesis.
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue with adequate volume, check of bladder pressure qd
   -Renal Dose all meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, admitted with decompensated liver failure and transient acute renal failure. She has shown rapid improvement with volume support and continued treatment for Hepatic Venous Hypertension (HRS). The current issue is persistent anemia secondary to blood loss during paracentesis, with a CT scan indicating intra-peritoneal bleeding from a parietal vessel. The patient has a coagulopathy related to underlying liver disease and has received 3 units of transfusion per day. Surgery has been consulted but declined surgical intervention at this time. The patient's coagulopathy is being managed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), but minimal change in bleeding rate has been observed. The plan is to discuss possible interventions to stabilize the bleeding with surgery and explore an exploratory laparotomy if necessary. The risk of surgery is excessive due to the risk of recurrent or persistent bleeding following intervention. Normalization of coagulation is being attempted. The patient also has cirrhosis, acute renal failure, and hepatic encephalopathy, which are being managed accordingly. The patient's respiratory status has improved with paracentesis."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process. Consider repeat head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting
   of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt
   increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic.  Therapeutic para done [**2-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Cultures NGTD. F/U pending Cx.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely multifactorial. Baseline anemia of chronic disease,
   low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not grossly bloody), and
   evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding on paracentesis, CT scan. Unlikely
   that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low
   retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.
   Patient dropped hct again on [**3-19**] and received 4 more units of PRBCs.
   Per surgery, not operative candidate. Received 3U PRBCs, 12U FFP, 1plt
   yesterday + overnight.
   - q6h Hct/INR check.
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   Will also treat with aggressive FFP transfusions q6hr to curtail
   bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - F/U peritoneal amylase level for pancreatitis /intestinal perforation
   - pending

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis presumed secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. The patient presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She was initially hyponatremic but now has persistent hypernatremia. A head CT has been performed, ruling out acute intracranial processes.

2. SBP: The patient received Unasyn for 3 days at OSH for SBP prophylaxis. Upon arrival at the current facility, she started receiving ceftriaxone. She underwent a diagnostic paracentesis, with the second tap showing an increased white blood cell count with a left shift. The CTX was changed to Zosyn on 3/15 per informal ID recommendations.

3. Anemia: The patient likely has a multifactorial anemia, including baseline anemia of chronic disease, low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding, and evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding on paracentesis and CT scan. It is unlikely that the patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation/hemolysis, as lab data does not support this.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process. Consider repeat head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting
   of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt
   increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic.  Therapeutic para done [**2-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Cultures NGTD. F/U pending Cx.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely multifactorial. Baseline anemia of chronic disease,
   low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not grossly bloody), and
   evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding on paracentesis, CT scan. Unlikely
   that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low
   retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.
   Patient dropped hct again on [**3-19**] and received 4 more units of PRBCs.
   Per surgery, not operative candidate. Received 3U PRBCs, 12U FFP, 1plt
   yesterday + overnight.
   - q6h Hct/INR check.
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   Will also treat with aggressive FFP transfusions to curtail bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - F/U peritoneal amylase level for pancreatitis /intestinal
   perforation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of presumed secondary cirrhosis due to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She has also been found to have hypernatremia, likely due to transudative fluid loss.

The patient's current medical conditions include cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinemia, thrombosis, anemia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, LE edema, and a history of alcohol abuse. She is currently being treated for hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose and rifaximin. SBP prophylaxis with ceftriaxone has been initiated. The patient's anemia is multifactorial, including baseline anemia of chronic disease, low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding, and evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding. Blood product transfusions have been given to increase the patient's hematocrit level.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with acute renal failure indicated by an elevated creatinine level. This is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. Albumin infusion has improved the creatinine level, suggesting against hepatorenal syndrome.

Thrombocytopenia is also present, likely secondary to liver failure and splenomeg"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.
   - Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process. Consider repeat
   head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt
   increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic.  Therapeutic para done [**2-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Cultures NGTD. F/U pending Cx.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely multifactorial. Baseline anemia of chronic disease,
   low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not grossly bloody), and
   evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding on paracentesis, CT scan. Unlikely
   that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low
   retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.
   Patient dropped hct again on [**3-19**] and received 4 more units of PRBCs.
   Per surgery, not operative candidate. Received 2U PRBCs, 4U FFP, 1plt
   yesterday/overnight.
   - q6h Hct/INR check.
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   Will also treat with aggressive FFP transfusions to curtail bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - F/U peritoneal amylase level for pancreatitis /intestinal
   perforation.
   - Will re-discuss with surgery as patient continues to bleed despite
   aggressive medical tx x 3days.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow
   in the [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more
   likely due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable to decreasing
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per hepatology.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Holding albumin per hepatology.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improving. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH
   normal, arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against
   TTP/HUS. Received 1U platelets overnight.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   abdominal bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Increase free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs.
   - Recheck Na this afternoon and consider starting D5W if Na not fully
   corrected by then.
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).
   .
   Access: PIV, PICC (placed [**3-19**])

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. She is currently experiencing anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and lower extremity (LE) edema. The patient's liver failure is likely due to a combination of alcohol abuse and chronic acetaminophen use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver failure. This condition can lead to confusion, disorientation, and even coma if not properly managed.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has developed SBP, a bacterial infection of the ascitic fluid in the abdomen. This condition can be life-threatening if not promptly treated with antibiotics.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely caused by multiple factors such as chronic disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, and intraperitoneal bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, characterized by a significant increase in creatinine levels. This may"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and anemia, admitted to the ICU for acute liver failure. The patient's condition has been deteriorating rapidly, with significant hemodynamic instability and multiorgan dysfunction.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's hemoglobin level has continued to fall despite aggressive transfusion of blood products. The patient has also experienced episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were thought to be related to the positioning of the peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC) line. The line was pulled back, but the patient subsequently experienced another episode of ventricular tachycardia followed by sinus tachycardia.

The patient's potassium level was repleted, and a family meeting was held to discuss the continuation of do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status and ongoing transfusions. The patient's husband is not yet ready to proceed with these decisions.

Physical examination findings include anisocoria, diaphoresis, scleral icterus, clear lung fields, regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur, tense abdomen with ascites, and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Neurological examination reveals alertness with minimal speech and eye tracking.

Laboratory results show worsening anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated liver enzymes. Notably, the patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 25.5 g/dL to 20.0 g/dL, and the hematocrit has decreased from 25.2% to 20.0%. The white blood cell count has fluctuated between 10.4 and 11.9 thousand cells/mm3. Platelet count has varied between 53 and 64 thousand cells/mm3. Renal function tests reveal elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential renal impairment.

The patient's condition is complicated by several medical issues, including acute anemia secondary to blood loss, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hepatorenal syndrome, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's history of cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and hemolytic anemia contributes to the complexity of the case.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Anemia: The patient's ongoing blood loss and the inability to maintain hemoglobin levels may lead to further anemia, compromising tissue oxygenation and potentially causing organ dysfunction.

2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte imbalances, including low potassium and sodium levels, require careful management to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.

3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's liver failure and renal dysfunction increase the risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome, a potentially reversible form of kidney failure in patients with advanced liver disease.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's tense abdomen with ascites and lower extremity edema suggest impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ul"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and alcoholic liver disease. He presented to the ICU with acute anemia secondary to blood loss, electrolyte and fluid disorders, hepatorenal syndrome, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been receiving aggressive transfusion of blood products and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Due to the patient's impaired immune system and prolonged hospital stay, there is a high risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), or urinary tract infection (UTI).
2. Bleeding: The patient's acute anemia is secondary to blood loss, which could be due to ongoing bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or other sources. There is a risk of further bleeding complications, especially considering the patient's coagulopathy.
3. Liver failure: The patient's history of cirrhosis and alcoholic liver disease puts him at risk for further deterioration in liver function. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Renal failure: The patient is already experiencing hepatorenal syndrome, which indicates compromised renal function. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with history of cirrhosis and now with decompensated liver
   failure and with encephalopathy that has improved with supportive Rx.
   She had transient worsening of renal failure which has shown some
   improvement in the setting of increased volume and support for
   component of HRS.  She has had persistence of anemia and medical Rx
   only available given signficant risk for surgery.  Last night and
   across yesterday she has evolved an increasing frequency of wide
   complex tachycardia which have been self limited but with duration of
   up to 35 beats.
   1) ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE,
   BLEEDING)--Clearly most likely source is intraperitoneal.  Surgery
   consulted and aid from Hepatology team obtained
   -FFP to work to normalize INR
   -PRBC as needed for trend down
   -Will continue to look for alternative sources
   2)Cirrhosis-
   Encephaoloapthy-Lactulose, Rifaxamin
   SBP-Vanco/ZOsyn started
   Hepato-Renal Syndrome-Support with Octreotide/Midodrine
   Ascites-Intermittent impairment in ventilatory function but responsive
   to tap, bleed to be Rx
d with FFP and PRBC as needed
goal INR is <1.5
   if able to be achieved
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Improved and will continue to support with volume and control of SVR
   4)Tachycardia-Appears to be dominant supraventricular source of
   tachycardia
   -Will continue to assure lytes normalized
Mg and K+ today
   -Will continue with telemetry

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and decompensated liver failure, currently admitted to the ICU. She has been experiencing encephalopathy, anemia secondary to blood loss, renal failure, and an increasing frequency of wide complex tachycardia. The patient has received supportive care, including FFP and PRBC transfusions, lactulose, rifaximin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The plan is to continue monitoring and treating the patient's acute issues, including blood loss anemia and arrhythmia. The patient's prognosis remains uncertain, and discussions have been held with the family regarding the possibility of hospice support if there is no significant recovery of hepatic function.

1. ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING): The patient's ongoing bleeding is a concern, as it can lead to further blood loss and exacerbate anemia. Continued monitoring and support with FFP and PRBC transfusions will be necessary.
2. CIRRHOSIS: The patient's underlying cirrhosis is a chronic condition that contributes to liver dysfunction and portal hypertension. Complications such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome may arise if not properly managed.
3. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: The patient has shown some improvement in"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process. Consider repeat head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting
   of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt
   increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic.  Therapeutic para done [**2-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Cultures NGTD. F/U pending Cx.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely multifactorial. Baseline anemia of chronic disease,
   low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not grossly bloody), and
   evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding on paracentesis, CT scan. Unlikely
   that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low
   retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.
   Patient dropped hct again on [**3-19**] and received 4 more units of PRBCs.
   Per surgery, not operative candidate. Received 3U PRBCs, 12U FFP, 1plt
   yesterday + overnight.
   - q6h Hct/INR check.
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   Will also treat with aggressive FFP transfusions q6hr to curtail
   bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - F/U peritoneal amylase level for pancreatitis /intestinal perforation
   - pending
   - Surgery recs: no OR
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow
   in the [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more
   likely due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable in upper 40s
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per hepatology.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Holding albumin per hepatology.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improving. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH
   normal, arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against
   TTP/HUS. Received 1U platelets overnight.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   abdominal bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs.
   - Cont D5W at 75cc/hr
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).
   .
   Access: PIV, PICC (placed [**3-19**])

   Disposition: ICU for now
 will discuss with the family the options for
   further treatment in setting of poor prognosis as liver function not

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her condition. These include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Treatment includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin, as well as treating hypernatremia.

2. SBP: The patient received Unasyn for SBP prophylaxis and was started on ceftriaxone upon arrival. The second tap showed increased white blood cells with a left shift, and the CTX was changed to Zosyn on 3/15.

3. Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia of chronic disease, low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding, and evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding on paracentesis. She received 4 more units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on 3/19.

4. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has mild transaminitis with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, lower extremity edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated international normalized ratio (INR). This is likely secondary to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic acetaminophen use.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine (Cr) trended up from 0.8 to a peak of 3.0, indicating acute renal failure. FENa (<1%) suggests pre-renal cause due to hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against HRS.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is improving, likely secondary to liver failure and splenomegaly. Evaluation for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is difficult to interpret with liver failure.

7. Hypernatremia: The patient initially had hyponatremia secondary to ascites and lower extremity edema, but then became hypernatremic. This is suspected to be due to total parenteral nutrition (TF).

8. Lower extremity edema: The patient has stable bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, which is likely related to liver failure.

9. History of alcohol abuse: The patient completed 5 days of high-dose thiamine.

10. Other issues: The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she has a PICC line, 20-gauge and 18-gauge lines, and is receiving renal nutrition."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process. Consider repeat head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting
   of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt
   increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic.  Therapeutic para done [**2-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Cultures NGTD. F/U pending Cx.
   .
   # Anemia: Likely multifactorial. Baseline anemia of chronic disease,
   low grade GI bleed (stools guaiac pos, not grossly bloody), and
   evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding on paracentesis, CT scan. Unlikely
   that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low
   retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.
   Patient dropped hct again on [**3-19**] and received 4 more units of PRBCs.
   Per surgery, not operative candidate. Received 3U PRBCs, 12U FFP, 1plt
   yesterday + overnight.
   - q6h Hct/INR check.
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   Will also treat with aggressive FFP transfusions q6hr to curtail
   bleeding.
   - Appreciate liver recs; EGD if evidence of brisk GIB
   - F/U peritoneal amylase level for pancreatitis /intestinal perforation
   - pending
   - Surgery recs: no OR
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Month/Year (2) 4182**] [**Month/Year (2) 4244**] thrombosis. Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow
   in the [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more
   likely due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable in upper 40s
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: continue lactulose, rifaximin, octreotide and
   midodrine. Pt completed 2 days of albumin infusion and steroids were
   stopped per hepatology.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Cr trended up from 0.8 to peak of 3.0. FENa <1%,
   thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or hepatorenal
   syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion, which argues against
   HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Holding albumin per hepatology.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improving. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH
   normal, arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against
   TTP/HUS. Received 1U platelets overnight.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   abdominal bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs.
   - Cont D5W at 75cc/hr
   .
   #.  LE edema.  Stable. B/l LE pitting edema almost certainly related to
   liver failure, as TTE did not show definitive etiology.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).
   .
   Access: PIV, PICC (placed [**3-19**])

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including altered mental status, suspected hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status - The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy and SBP. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Anemia - The patient has a baseline anemia of chronic disease, low-grade gastrointestinal bleeding, and evidence of intraperitoneal bleeding. Further investigation is necessary to identify the underlying cause and guide management.
3. Hyperbilirubinemia - The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, which may be due to liver failure. Close monitoring of liver enzymes and bilirubin levels is required, along with appropriate supportive care.
4. Acute renal failure - The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.8 to a peak of 3.0, indicating acute renal failure. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management, such as the use of diuretics or renal replacement therapy.
5. Thrombocytopenia - The patient's platelet count is low, likely secondary to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status. Has increasing O2 requirement today and
   abdomenal exam not fully consistent with simple ascites.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial. Has been receiving increasing doses
   of morphine for abdominal pain, which could contribute to decreased
   respiratory drive. Decreased chest wall compliance due to large
   ascites. Volume overload (LOS 18 L positive) as has been receiving
   large amounts of blood products.
   - CXR to assess for pulm edema/PNA/other processes
   - Check ABG
   - onsider Lasix if + pulm edema due to volume overload
   - Keep O2 sat >92%
   - minimize sedating medications
   .
   # Abnormal abdominal exam. Noted to be tympanic on percussion centrally
   despite large ascites. Also tense and distended in upper quadrants but
   relaxed and soft in the lower quadrants. Unable to check residuals with
   her dobhoff. Peritoneal amylase =13, thus unlikely pancreatitis or
   intestinal perf.
   - Check KUB for ileus/obstruction
   - Minimize opiate use
   - Check C. diff
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process. Consider repeat head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting
   of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt
   increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic.  Therapeutic para done [**3-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid. Requiring increasing amounts of pain
   meds.
   - D/C zosyn (Day 1=[**3-15**]) and Vanco (Day 1 =[**3-17**]) today and start Cipro
   for total [**Month/Year (2) 114**] course of 2 weeks (count day 1 of zosyn as day 1 of [**Month/Year (2) 114**]
   course, thus [**3-15**]) per liver recs. Once completes 2 weeks of [**Last Name (LF) 114**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**]
   continue cipro at prophylactic dosage
   - peritoneal fluid showing no growth on culture
   .
   # Anemia: Has been stable x 24 hours with aggressive FFP transfusions.
   Cause of anemia likely multifactorial, biggest contributor being
   intrabdominal bleeding after paracenteses superimposed on baseline
   anemia of chronic disease. Also has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not
   grossly bloody). Unlikely that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab
   data underwhelming - low retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH,
   normal haptoglobin.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions as Hct stable for the time
   being
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   - Appreciate liver recs
   - GSurgery/ transplant surgery recs: no OR
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Hospital1 4182**] [**Hospital1 4244**] thrombosis. Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow
   in the [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more
   likely due to hemolysis)
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable in upper 40s
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs: will stop octreotide and midodrine today.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. Now resolved. Cr trended up to peak of 3.0
   previously. FENa <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool
   output) or hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion
   (x3), which argues against HRS.
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC will be difficult to
   interpret with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated
   PTT, low fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH
   normal, arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against
   TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   abdominal bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs.
   - Cont D5W at 75cc/hr (was decreased to 35cc/hr overnight, will turn it
   back up)
   .
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including hypoxia, abnormal abdominal exam, altered mental status, anemia, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing increasing oxygen requirements, which could be due to decreased respiratory drive from morphine use, decreased chest wall compliance due to large ascites, or volume overload. A chest X-ray should be ordered to assess for pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or other processes. ABG should be checked, and lasix may be considered if there is pulmonary edema due to volume overload. The goal is to maintain O2 saturation above 92%.

2. Abnormal Abdominal Exam: The patient's abdominal exam shows tympanic percussion centrally despite large ascites, suggesting the presence of an intra-abdominal collection. Peritoneal amylase levels are normal, making pancreatitis or intestinal perforation less likely. Further evaluation is needed, including checking for ileus or obstruction in the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. Minimizing opiate use may also be helpful.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is exhibiting signs of hepatic encephalopathy and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). A head CT should be repeated if cerebral"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with cirrhosis and admitted with hepatic failure now with
   contined failure of hepatic function but with improved stability of
   renal function, mental status and intra-peritoneal bleeding appears to
   have slowed substantially.
   1)Anemia-Secondary to blood loss-She has not had transfusion for >24
   hours, HCT is unchanged
   -Follow HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -Transfuse as needed
   -Hold FFP for now given stability
   2)Cirrhosis/Ascites/SBP
   -Vanco/Zosyn
Change to Cipro [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue with Lactulose/Rifaxamin
   -Re-check bladder pressure
   3)EtOH abuse
   -Thiamine/Folate/MVI
   4)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue Midodrine/Octreotide
   -Follow U/O which has diminished
   -[**Month (only) 11**] need increased volume for delivery as evidenced by other evidence
   with Hypernatremia
   -Will recheck bladder pressure today but do not seen any evidence of
   change in abdominal exam
   5)Hypoxemia-
   -[**Month (only) 11**] be related to worsening hypoventilation in the setting of MSO4
   -ABG would help differentiate
   _Will check bladder pressure for possible indication for paracentesis
   but do not suspect it is dominant cause based on exam

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis and hepatic failure. She has continued failure of hepatic function but shows improved stability in renal function, mental status, and intra-peritoneal bleeding. The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, and she has not received a transfusion in over 24 hours. Her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia-Secondary to blood loss: The patient's anemia is a result of ongoing blood loss, which can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia. If not managed appropriately, this can result in further deterioration of the patient's condition.

2. Cirrhosis/Ascites/SBP: The patient has cirrhosis with associated complications such as ascites and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). If left untreated, SBP can progress to sepsis and multiorgan failure.

3. EtOH abuse: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, which contributes to the development and progression of cirrhosis. Continued alcohol consumption can exacerbate liver damage and lead to further complications.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, characterized by oliguria and elevated serum creatinine levels. Without proper management, renal failure can progress to end-stage renal disease, necessitating dialysis or kidney transplantation.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing hypoxemia"

   Imaging
   [**3-23**] KUB - Severe ascites. No evidence of obstruction.
   [**3-23**] CXR
 (Prelim Read) New multiple opacities in both lungs,
   suggestive of multifocal pneumonia in
   progress. PICC line is not visible (removed?).
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status. Has increasing O2 requirement today and
   abdomenal exam not fully consistent with simple ascites.
   .
   # Hypoxia: KUB did show severe ascites and CXR shows possible
   multifocal PNA, however hypoxia dramatically improved after Narcan.
   Hypoxia likely due to decreased respiratory drive due to morphine. Also
   received lasix 20mg x1 with little increase in urine output. AFebrile,
   no cough. Consider starting Abx for PNA.
   - F/U final read CXR.
   - Keep O2 sat >92%
   - avoid narcotics
   .
   # Abnormal abdominal exam: On [**3-23**], noted to be tympanic centrally
   despite large ascites. Also tense and distended in upper quadrants but
   relaxed and soft in the lower quadrants. Unable to check residuals with
   her dobhoff. Peritoneal amylase =13, thus unlikely pancreatitis or
   intestinal perf. KUB did not show obstruction. C.diff negative.
   - Minimize opiate use
   .
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**]. Already on ciprofloxacin. Foley changed
   overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**]. Will follow up on culture and adjust abx as
   needed.
   - f/u urine culture.
   - Continue cipro
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process. Consider repeat head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting
   of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] and Cipro started to complete
   total; 2 week abd course. Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**],
   pt increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**]
   to remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid. Required increasing pain meds
   [**Date range (1) 5037**] but d/c
d [**3-23**].
   - Continue Cipro for total abx course of 2 weeks (last day [**3-28**]) per
   liver recs. Once completes 2 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue cipro at prophylactic
   dosage
   - peritoneal fluid showing no growth on culture
   .
   # Anemia: Has been stable x 48 hrs with aggressive FFP transfusions.
   Cause likely multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabd bleeding
   after paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease.
   Also has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely
   that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low
   retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.
   GSurgery/ transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions as Hct stable
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Hospital1 4182**] [**Hospital1 4244**] thrombosis. Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow
   in the [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more
   likely due to hemolysis). d/c
d midodrine/octreotide 3/25 per liver.
   Bladder Pressure 18 on [**3-23**].
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin slightly increased today at 50.8
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs
   - Monitor bladder pressure.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion (x3), which
   argues against HRS.  Cr normalized x 5days but again elevated at 1.5
   today. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to lasix vs. intravasc. volume depletion vs.
   hepatorenal syndrome, especially in setting of d/c
   midodrine/octreotide.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   Platelets stable in 50s.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   abdominal bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs.
   - Cont D5W at 75cc/hr
   .
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of presumed secondary cirrhosis due to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. She is currently experiencing hypoxia, severe ascites without obstruction, anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and hepatic encephalopathy. She also has a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and has undergone therapeutic paracentesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to decreased respiratory drive caused by morphine. The improvement in hypoxia after Narcan administration suggests opioid-induced respiratory depression. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and avoidance of narcotics are recommended.

2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient's new opacities on chest X-ray suggest multifocal pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated, and follow-up chest X-rays should be performed to monitor the progression of the infection.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urinalysis, indicating a UTI. She is already on ciprofloxacin, and further follow-up on urine culture is necessary. Adjustments to antibiotic therapy may be required based on the culture results.

4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient exhibits signs of hepatic encephalopathy, including altered mental status. Treatment should involve continuing lactul"

   Imaging
   [**3-23**] KUB - Severe ascites. No evidence of obstruction.
   [**3-23**] CXR
 (Prelim Read) New multiple opacities in both lungs,
   suggestive of multifocal pneumonia in
   progress. PICC line is not visible (removed?).
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status. Has increasing O2 requirement today and
   abdomenal exam not fully consistent with simple ascites.
   .
   # Hypoxia: KUB did show severe ascites and CXR shows possible
   multifocal PNA, however hypoxia dramatically improved after Narcan.
   Hypoxia likely due to decreased respiratory drive due to morphine. Also
   received lasix 20mg x1 with little increase in urine output. AFebrile,
   no cough. Consider starting Abx for PNA.
   - F/U final read CXR.
   - Keep O2 sat >92%
   - avoid narcotics
   .
   # Abnormal abdominal exam: On [**3-23**], noted to be tympanic centrally
   despite large ascites. Also tense and distended in upper quadrants but
   relaxed and soft in the lower quadrants. Unable to check residuals with
   her dobhoff. Peritoneal amylase =13, thus unlikely pancreatitis or
   intestinal perf. KUB did not show obstruction. C.diff negative.
   - Minimize opiate use
   .
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**]. Already on ciprofloxacin. Foley changed
   overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**]. Will follow up on culture and adjust abx as
   needed.
   - f/u urine culture.
   - Continue cipro
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process. Consider repeat head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting
   of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] and Cipro started to complete
   total; 2 week abd course. Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**],
   pt increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**]
   to remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid. Required increasing pain meds
   [**Date range (1) 5037**] but d/c
d [**3-23**].
   - Continue Cipro for total abx course of 2 weeks (last day [**3-28**]) per
   liver recs. Once completes 2 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue cipro at prophylactic
   dosage
   - peritoneal fluid showing no growth on culture
   .
   # Anemia: Has been stable x 48 hrs with aggressive FFP transfusions.
   Cause likely multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabd bleeding
   after paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease.
   Also has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely
   that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low
   retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.
   GSurgery/ transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions as Hct stable
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Hospital1 4182**] [**Hospital1 4244**] thrombosis. Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow
   in the [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more
   likely due to hemolysis). d/c
d midodrine/octreotide 3/25 per liver.
   Bladder Pressure 18 on [**3-23**].
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin slightly increased today at 50.8
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs
   - Monitor bladder pressure.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion (x3), which
   argues against HRS.  Cr normalized x 5days but again elevated at 1.5
   today. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to lasix vs. intravasc. volume depletion vs.
   hepatorenal syndrome, especially in setting of d/c
   midodrine/octreotide.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   Platelets stable in 50s.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   abdominal bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs.
   - Cont D5W at 75cc/hr
   .
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use, presenting with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. She has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, likely due to decreased respiratory drive caused by morphine. The patient also has severe ascites without evidence of obstruction, tense and distended abdomen in the upper quadrants, and clear lungs bilaterally. She is experiencing a urinary tract infection, as indicated by a positive urinalysis and culture pending. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis and treatment. Her liver enzymes are elevated, and she has evidence of portal hypertension with splenomegaly and esophageal varices. She has thrombocytopenia likely secondary to liver failure and splenomegaly. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and completed 5 days of high-dose thiamine. She is currently being treated for multifocal pneumonia, and her respiratory support has been adjusted accordingly."

   Imaging
   [**3-23**] KUB - Severe ascites. No evidence of obstruction.
   [**3-23**] CXR
 (Prelim Read) New multiple opacities in both lungs,
   suggestive of multifocal pneumonia in
   progress. PICC line is not visible (removed?).
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status. Has increasing O2 requirement today and
   abdomenal exam not fully consistent with simple ascites.
   .
   # Hypoxia: KUB did show severe ascites and CXR shows possible
   multifocal PNA, however hypoxia dramatically improved after Narcan.
   Hypoxia likely due to decreased respiratory drive due to morphine. Also
   received lasix 20mg x1 with little increase in urine output.
   - Keep O2 sat >92%
   - avoid narcotics
   .
   # Abnormal abdominal exam: On [**3-23**], noted to be tympanic centrally
   despite large ascites. Also tense and distended in upper quadrants but
   relaxed and soft in the lower quadrants. Unable to check residuals with
   her dobhoff. Peritoneal amylase =13, thus unlikely pancreatitis or
   intestinal perf. KUB did not show obstruction. C.diff negative.
   - Minimize opiate use
   .
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**]. Already on ciprofloxacin. Foley changed
   overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**]. Will follow up on culture and adjust abx as
   needed.
   - f/u urine culture.
   - Continue cipro
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process. Consider repeat head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting
   of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] and Cipro started to complete
   total; 2 week abd course. Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**],
   pt increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**]
   to remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid. Required increasing pain meds
   [**Date range (1) 5037**] but d/c
d [**3-23**].
   - Continue Cipro for total abx course of 2 weeks (last day [**3-28**]) per
   liver recs. Once completes 2 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue cipro at prophylactic
   dosage
   - peritoneal fluid showing no growth on culture
   .
   # Anemia: Has been stable x 48 hrs with aggressive FFP transfusions.
   Cause likely multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabd bleeding
   after paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease.
   Also has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely
   that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low
   retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.
   GSurgery/ transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions as Hct stable
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Hospital1 4182**] [**Hospital1 4244**] thrombosis. Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow
   in the [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more
   likely due to hemolysis). d/c
d midodrine/octreotide 3/25 per liver.
   Bladder Pressure 18 on [**3-23**].
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin slightly increased today at 50.8
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs
   - Monitor bladder pressure.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion (x3), which
   argues against HRS.  Cr normalized x 5days but again elevated at 1.5
   today. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to lasix vs. intravasc. volume depletion vs.
   hepatorenal syndrome, especially in setting of d/c
   midodrine/octreotide.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   Platelets stable in 50s.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   abdominal bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs.
   - Cont D5W at 75cc/hr
   .
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia).
   .
   Access: PIV, PICC (placed [**3-19**])

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including hypoxia, abnormal abdominal exam findings suggestive of ascites, urinary tract infection, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and possible hepatocellular carcinoma. 

The patient's hypoxia improved after receiving Narcan and decreased ascites visible on ultrasound. She was given Lasix to address fluid overload but had little increase in urine output. The patient is currently on Cipro to complete a total of 2-week antibiotic course.

Her abdominal exam shows tense ascites in the upper half of the abdomen with decreased bowel sounds. The patient is unable to answer questions regarding pain due to moaning at baseline. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. Her blood cultures are pending, and imaging studies reveal severe ascites without evidence of obstruction and new multiple opacities in both lungs suggestive of multifocal pneumonia.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy and SBP. She has been treated with lactulose and rifaximin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and alcohol abuse, presenting to the ICU with severe ascites, acute kidney injury, and hypoxemia. He has been on mechanical ventilation and receiving intravenous fluids. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing acute pain, hypernatremia, coagulopathy, anemia secondary to blood loss, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hepatorenal syndrome, impaired skin integrity, and a history of hemolytic anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: This is a type of kidney failure that can occur in patients with advanced liver disease, such as cirrhosis. It is characterized by low urine output and elevated blood creatinine levels.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2) indicates impaired gas exchange, which may be due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory complications if not managed properly.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), along with low fibrinogen levels, suggest a bleeding tendency. This increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine and decreased urine output indicate AKI, which"

   Imaging
   [**3-23**] KUB - Severe ascites. No evidence of obstruction.
   [**3-23**] CXR
 (Prelim Read) New multiple opacities in both lungs,
   suggestive of multifocal pneumonia in
   progress. PICC line is not visible (removed?).
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status. Has increased 02 requirement, improved from
   yesterday but not back to baseline.
   .
   # Hypoxia: KUB did show severe ascites and CXR shows possible
   multifocal PNA, however RR/hypoxia somewhat  improved after Narcan.
   Hypoxia likely due to decreased respiratory drive due to morphine as
   well as possible new multifocal PNA.  Patient had temp to 100.0F but
   does not have cough. Has been on vanc/zosyn x9days, but is at risk for
   HAP.
   - F/U final read CXR.
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated for goal O2 sat >92%
   - avoid narcotics
   - Restart vanc/zosyn for HAP and monitor for improvement in respiratory
   status.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion (x3), which
   argues against HRS.  Cr normalized x 5days but again elevated at 1.5
   today. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to lasix vs. intravasc. volume depletion vs.
   hepatorenal syndrome, especially in setting of d/c
   midodrine/octreotide. Highest suspicion for intravascular volume
   depletion.
   - Give Albumin x1 per hepatology, restart Octreotide.
   - Check PM lytes and adjust albumin as necessary.
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process. Consider repeat head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting
   of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] and Cipro started to complete
   total; 2 week abd course. No growth on culture of peritoneal fluid.
   Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt increasingly
   uncomfortable and dyspneic. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**] to remove 2.5L
   grossly bloody fluid. Required increasing pain meds [**Date range (1) 5037**] but d/c
   [**3-23**] because no longer complaining of pain.
   - Continue Cipro for total abx course of 2 weeks (last day [**3-28**]) per
   liver recs. Once completes 2 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue cipro at prophylactic
   dosage
   - Recheck bladder pressure with goal < 20mmHg
   .
   # Anemia: Has been stable x 48 hrs with aggressive FFP transfusions.
   Cause likely multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabd bleeding
   after paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease.
   Also has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely
   that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low
   retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.
   GSurgery/ transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions as Hct stable
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Hospital1 4182**] [**Hospital1 4244**] thrombosis. Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow
   in the [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more
   likely due to hemolysis). d/c
d midodrine/octreotide 3/25 per liver.
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin slightly increased today at 50.8
   - Restart Octreotide today given ARF.
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs
   - Monitor bladder pressure.
   .
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**]. Already on ciprofloxacin. Foley changed
   overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**]. Will follow up on culture and adjust abx as
   needed.
   - f/u urine culture.
   - Continue cipro
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   Platelets stable in 50s.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   abdominal bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs.
   - Cont D5W at 75cc/hr
   .
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. She is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. 

24-hour events include severe ascites, hypoxia, and the development of new opacities on chest X-ray, suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. The patient's condition has improved slightly with the administration of Narcan, which improved oxygenation and reduced visible ascites.

Medication changes include stopping Vanc and Zosyn, which were previously being used to treat suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia, and starting Cipro to complete a total two-week antibiotic course. Lasix was also administered, but only resulted in a small increase in urine output. The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.5 to 1.5, indicating acute renal failure.

Other findings include anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated with a left shift, indicating an infection. Blood cultures have been obtained, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirements have improved slightly since yesterday, but she is still not back to baseline. Hypoxia is likely due to decreased respiratory drive caused by morphine as well as possible new multifocal pneumonia. The patient's temperature reached 100.0°F, but she does not have a"

   [**3-23**] KUB - Severe ascites. No evidence of obstruction.
   [**3-23**] CXR
 (Prelim Read) New multiple opacities in both lungs,
   suggestive of multifocal pneumonia in
   progress. PICC line is not visible (removed?).
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status. Has increased 02 requirement, improved from
   yesterday but not back to baseline.
   .
   # Hypoxia: KUB did show severe ascites and CXR shows possible
   multifocal PNA, however RR/hypoxia somewhat  improved after Narcan.
   Hypoxia likely due to decreased respiratory drive due to morphine as
   well as possible new multifocal PNA.  Patient had temp to 100.0F but
   does not have cough. Has been on vanc/zosyn x9days, but is still at
   risk for HAP. Will hold on starting vanc/cefepime for HAP as patient
   able to wean down to nasal cannula.
   - F/U final read CXR.
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated for goal O2 sat >92%
   - avoid narcotics
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion (x3), which
   argues against HRS.  Cr normalized x 5days but again elevated at 1.5
   today. [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to lasix vs. intravasc. volume depletion vs.
   hepatorenal syndrome, especially in setting of d/c
   midodrine/octreotide. Highest suspicion for intravascular volume
   depletion. Will hold on restarting midodrine/octreotide for now,
   pending PM creatinine and hepatology recs.
   - Give Albumin once today and tomorrow per hepatology
   - Check PM lytes.
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process. Consider repeat head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting
   of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] and Cipro started to complete
   total; 2 week abd course. No growth on culture of peritoneal fluid.
   Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt increasingly
   uncomfortable and dyspneic. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**] to remove 2.5L
   grossly bloody fluid. Required increasing pain meds [**Date range (1) 5037**] but d/c
   [**3-23**] because no longer complaining of pain.
   - Continue Cipro for total abx course of 2 weeks (last day [**3-28**]) per
   liver recs. Once completes 2 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue cipro at prophylactic
   dosage
   - Recheck bladder pressure with goal < 20mmHg
   .
   # Anemia: Has been stable x 48 hrs with aggressive FFP transfusions.
   Cause likely multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabd bleeding
   after paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease.
   Also has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely
   that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low
   retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin.
   GSurgery/ transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions as Hct stable
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / [**Hospital1 4182**] [**Hospital1 4244**] thrombosis. Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with embarrassment by chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband. [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) 4244**] thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow
   in the [**Name2 (NI) 4182**] circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI (feels anemia more
   likely due to hemolysis). d/c
d midodrine/octreotide 3/25 per liver.
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin slightly increased today at 50.8
   - Restart Octreotide today given ARF.
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - appreciate liver recs
   - Monitor bladder pressure.
   .
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**]. Already on ciprofloxacin. Foley changed
   overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**]. Will follow up on culture and adjust abx as
   needed.
   - f/u urine culture.
   - Continue cipro
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   Platelets stable in 50s.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   abdominal bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs.
   - Cont D5W at 75cc/hr

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status. The patient has severe ascites, no evidence of obstruction, and new opacities on chest X-ray suggestive of multifocal pneumonia in progress. She also has thrombocytopenia, elevated INR, hepatosplenomegaly, and mild transaminitis. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia likely due to decreased respiratory drive from morphine as well as possible new multifocal pneumonia. She has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.5, likely secondary to hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's altered mental status is likely hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). 

The patient's medical history includes alcohol abuse and chronic acetaminophen use. She has been treated with various antibiotics, including cefepime and vancomycin, but her recent urine culture showed growth of E. coli O157:H7, which argues against TTP/HUS. 

The patient's current plan includes weaning off supplemental oxygen, avoiding narcotics, and monitoring for any changes in her condition. She is to receive albumin infusions and continue lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. The patient will continue with ciprof"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use.
- She presents with anemia, jaundice, and altered mental status.
- The patient has increased oxygen requirements and is at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- She also has acute renal failure with a rising creatinine level, likely due to hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome.
- The patient has suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and was treated with antibiotics.
- She has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, both gross and microscopic.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to liver failure and splenomegaly.
- She has hypernatremia and was previously hyponatremic.
- The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy and SBP.
- She is on prophylactic antibiotics and has a Foley catheter in place.
- The patient's condition is stable, and she is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to multifocal pneumonia and decreased respiratory drive caused by morphine. It is important to monitor her oxygen saturation levels and consider weaning off supplemental oxygen as tolerated.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and her creatinine level is elevated. Further evaluation is"

   [**3-23**] CXR
 (Prelim Read) New multiple opacities in both lungs,
   suggestive of multifocal pneumonia in
   progress. PICC line is not visible (removed?).
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcoholism and acetaminophen use, here with anemia, jaundice, and
   altered mental status. Has increased 02 requirement, improved from
   yesterday but not back to baseline.
   .
   # Hypoxia: KUB did show severe ascites and CXR shows possible
   multifocal PNA, however RR/hypoxia somewhat  improved after Narcan.
   Hypoxia likely due to decreased respiratory drive due to morphine as
   well as possible new multifocal PNA. Also received lasix 20mg x1 with
   little increase in urine output. AFebrile, no cough. Consider starting
   Abx for PNA.
   - F/U final read CXR.
   - Keep O2 sat >92%
   - avoid narcotics
   .
   # Abnormal abdominal exam: On [**3-23**], noted to be tympanic centrally
   despite large ascites. Also tense and distended in upper quadrants but
   relaxed and soft in the lower quadrants. Unable to check residuals with
   her dobhoff. Peritoneal amylase =13, thus unlikely pancreatitis or
   intestinal perf. KUB did not show obstruction. C.diff negative.
   - Minimize opiate use
   .
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**]. Already on ciprofloxacin. Foley changed
   overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**]. Will follow up on culture and adjust abx as
   needed.
   - f/u urine culture.
   - Continue cipro
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Initially was hyponatremic on presentation, now
   persistently hypernatremic.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process. Consider repeat head CT if suspect cerebral edema in setting
   of fulminant liver failure
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (currently stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] and Cipro started to complete
   total; 2 week abd course. Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**],
   pt increasingly uncomfortable and dyspneic. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**]
   to remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid. Required increasing pain meds
   [**Date range (1) 5037**] but d/c
d [**3-23**].
   - Continue Cipro for total abx course of 2 weeks (last day [**3-28**]) per
   liver recs. Once completes 2 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue cipro at prophylactic

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcoholism and acetaminophen use. She is currently experiencing hypoxia, likely due to decreased respiratory drive from morphine use as well as possible new multifocal pneumonia. The patient also has severe ascites without evidence of obstruction, tense and distended abdomen in the upper quadrants, and an altered mental status. She is anemic, jaundiced, and has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she is already on ciprofloxacin for suspected urinary tract infection. She has received Unasyn prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and has been treated with various antibiotics for her condition. Her renal function has improved after albumin infusion but remains abnormal, and she has stable thrombocytopenia. The patient has hypernatremia and requires further evaluation for potential causes. She is also being treated for potential hepatic encephalopathy and SBP. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is alert and oriented. She has a history of alcohol abuse and has completed high-dose thiamine therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and efforts should be made to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. Narcotics should be avoided or minimized, and treatment for possible pneumonia should be initiated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and anemia, who was admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock. On admission, the patient had severe ascites and multiple new opacities on the chest X-ray, suggesting multifocal pneumonia. The initial treatment included paracentesis, lasix for fluid overload, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the patient's condition worsened, and there was no improvement in ascites despite the medical interventions. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate remained stable, but the respiratory rate increased, and oxygen saturation decreased to 94%. The patient received naloxone for hypoxia and showed improvement with decreased ascites visible on ultrasound.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis of the liver. He presented with severe ascites, which is an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen commonly seen in cirrhosis. The ascites did not respond to medical management, and the patient's overall condition deteriorated. The presence of new opacities on the chest X-ray indicates possible pneumonia, which can be a serious complication in patients with cirrhosis due to their weakened immune system.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. The decreased hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which can be"

   44 yo female with history of cirrhosis and persistent and sigfniciant
   hepatic compromise compliacated by altered mental status, renal failure
   and intra-peritoneal bleeding.
   1)Cirrhosis---multiple complications and will be managed as follows
   Altered Mental Status-
   -Lactulose/Rifaxamin
   Ascites-
   -Cipro
   -Check bladder pressure today and consider tap for rising pressure
   associated with respiratory compromise
   Acute Renal Failure-
   -Will provide replaced volume with albumin for now
   -Follow up creatinine
   -[**Month (only) 11**] need to return octreotide/midodrine
   -No diuresis peformed yesterday effectively
   2)Hypoxemia
is concerning for possible PNA but case is mixed.  Given
   significant risk with underlying compromise will
   -Start broad spectrum ABX
   -Will wean o2 as possible today.
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presenting with hepatic failure, hypoxemia, and altered mental status. She has experienced worsening renal function and intra-peritoneal bleeding. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving various treatments for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Failure: The patient's hepatic failure can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatopulmonary syndrome.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be a result of hepatic encephalopathy. If not properly managed, it can progress to deep coma or death.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires careful monitoring and management. Complications may include fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
4. Intra-peritoneal Bleeding: If not managed appropriately, the intra-peritoneal bleeding can worsen, leading to hemodynamic instability and potential shock.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further respiratory compromise. Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
6. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system, there is a risk of developing infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis admitted with decompensated liver failure, likely triggered by alcohol and Tylenol ingestion. She has ongoing issues of altered mental status, renal failure, and coagulopathy with blood loss anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, which can be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition needs to be managed with medications such as rifaximin and lactulose. Additionally, minimizing sedating medications is important. There is a concern for new pneumonia due to the presence of a right-sided infiltrate, although fevers and coughs are not prominent.

2. Hepato-Renal Syndrome/Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are worsening, indicating potential renal failure. Management with medications like midodrine, octreotide, and albumin should continue to support kidney function.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy with a flank hematoma noted on the left side. This could be due to blood loss, leading to a drop in hemoglobin concentration. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be given as needed for acute bleeding episodes.

4. Pneumonia: The presence of a right-sided infiltrate raises concerns about pneumonia. The patient's current antibiotic regimen should be adjusted accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back with worsening renal function, mental
   status and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxia: CXR with possible multifocal pna, but has had decreased
   oxygen requirement since narcan. She also has been on vanc/zosyn for
   the last 9 days so new HAP would be unlikely.  However, VRE, fungal or
   other ESBL organism is a possibility. No cough or fever for the last 24
   hours.  Currently appears tachypneic and uncomfortable. KUB yesterday
   also showed severe ascites, but patient's abdomen at this time appears
   to be predominantly distended from abdominal gas, likely a result of
   lactulose administration.  Bladder pressures have been relatively
   stable in the high teens.   Worsening hypoxia overnight [**3-25**], becoming
   more somnolent, able to maintain O2 sats > 90% with 100 FiO2. Improved
   somewhat with Narcan.
   - CXR shows new infiltrate
 aspiration vs edema
   - Avoid narcotics
   - Repeat bladder pressure
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated for goal O2 sat >92%
   - Would be helpful to get sputum sample though patient is not likely to
   cooperate with this.  Will treat for multifocal pna with vanc/zosyn as
   this likely was a new event/infiltrate.  [**Month (only) 11**] need to consider VRE
   coverage as well.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion (x3), which
   argued against HRS.  Cr had normalized x 5 days but again elevated on
   [**3-23**] and appears to be up-trending.  HRS treatment was discontinued and
   has been restarted over the last several days.
   - Continue albumin for likely intravascular volume depletion and HRS
   - Continue midodrine, octreotide
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Also persistently hypernatremic which is likely
   contributing to her MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) 368**] been receiving free water and Na is
   normalized this morning.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process.  Appears a bit more altered this morning, but is still
   responsive to voice.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] and Cipro started to complete
   total 2 week abd course. No growth on culture of peritoneal fluid.
   Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt increasingly
   uncomfortable and dyspneic. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**] to remove 2.5L
   grossly bloody fluid. Required increasing pain meds [**Date range (1) 5037**] but d/c
   [**3-23**] because no longer complaining of pain.
   - Restarted vanc/Zosyn, but will switch to Cipro after PNA resolves
   - Recheck bladder pressure today with goal < 20mmHg
   .
   # Anemia: Had been stable x 48 hrs with aggressive FFP transfusions.
   Cause likely multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabdominal
   bleeding after paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic
   disease. Also has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody).
   Unlikely that the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data
   underwhelming - low retic index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH,
   normal haptoglobin. GSurgery/ transplant surgery recs: no OR.  Anemia
   decreased overnight to 23 which may be in the setting of increased free
   water; however, with rising INR, patient may be continuing to bleed.
   She is receiving 1 unit prbcs on the floor this morning and
   post-transfusion Hct is pending.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions for now
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis: Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband prior to admission . Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to
   no collateral flow in the portal circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and Tylenol overuse. She is currently in the ICU with worsening renal function, mental status, and respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, portal vein thrombosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and hyperbilirubinemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing worsening respiratory distress and has a new infiltrate on her chest X-ray. This could indicate pneumonia or another respiratory infection.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been trending up, indicating a decline in kidney function. This could be due to hypovolemia, hepatorenal syndrome, or other causes.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been deteriorating, which could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, or electrolyte imbalances.
4. SBP: The patient had a positive culture for increased white blood cell count in the peritoneal fluid, suggesting SBP. She has already received treatment with ceftriaxone and is now on ciprofloxacin.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely multifactorial, with causes including intr"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back with worsening renal function, mental
   status and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxia: CXR with possible multifocal pna, but has had decreased
   oxygen requirement since narcan. She also has been on vanc/zosyn for
   the last 9 days so new HAP would be unlikely.  However, VRE, fungal or
   other ESBL organism is a possibility. No cough or fever for the last 24
   hours.  Currently appears tachypneic and uncomfortable. KUB yesterday
   also showed severe ascites, but patient's abdomen at this time appears
   to be predominantly distended from abdominal gas, likely a result of
   lactulose administration.  Bladder pressures have been relatively
   stable in the high teens.   Worsening hypoxia overnight [**3-25**], becoming
   more somnolent, able to maintain O2 sats > 90% with 100 FiO2. Improved
   somewhat with Narcan.
   - CXR shows new infiltrate
 aspiration vs edema
   - Likely needs to be intubated, but will monitor with ABG for worsening
   hypoxemia and hypercarbia
   - Avoid narcotics
   - Repeat bladder pressure
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated for goal O2 sat >92%
   - Would be helpful to get sputum sample though patient is not likely to
   cooperate with this.  Will treat for multifocal pna with vanc/zosyn as
   this likely was a new event/infiltrate.  [**Month (only) 11**] need to consider VRE
   coverage as well.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion (x3), which
   argued against HRS.  Cr had normalized x 5 days but again elevated on
   [**3-23**] and is increasing.  HRS treatment was discontinued and has been
   restarted over the last several days.
   - Continue albumin for likely intravascular volume depletion and HRS
   - Continue octreotide , increase midodrine per Liver
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Also persistently hypernatremic which is likely
   contributing to her AMS.  Has been receiving free water and Na is
   stable and mildly elevated.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process.  Appears a bit more altered this morning, but is still
   responsive to voice.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] and Cipro started to complete
   total 2 week abd course. No growth on culture of peritoneal fluid.
   Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt increasingly
   uncomfortable and dyspneic. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**] to remove 2.5L
   grossly bloody fluid. Required increasing pain meds [**Date range (1) 5037**] but d/c
   [**3-23**] because no longer complaining of pain.
   - Restarted vanc/Zosyn, but will switch to Cipro after PNA resolves
   - Recheck bladder pressure today with goal < 20mmHg
   .
   # Anemia: Stable after aggressive FFP transfusions. Cause likely
   multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after
   paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Also
   has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely that
   the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low retic
   index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin. GSurgery/
   transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions for now
   - Daily HCT check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis: Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband prior to admission . Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to
   no collateral flow in the portal circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI
   (feels anemia more likely due to hemolysis). D/c
d midodrine/octreotide
   3/25 per liver.
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable and elevated
   - Continue midodrine/octreotide as above
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - Appreciate liver recs, will continue to have ongoing discussion with
   liver team regarding prognosis and likelihood of recovery.
   .
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**], culture growing yeast. On ciprofloxacin.
   Foley changed overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**]. Will follow up on culture and adjust
   abx as needed.  Repeat culture growing yeast.
   - Continue cipro
   - Consider antifungal treatment if patient continues to decompensate,
   though no positive blood cultures
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Decreased D5W to 50cc/hr
   .
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia), PPI
   .
   Access: PIV, PICC (placed [**3-19**])
   .
   Code: Full code.  Ongoing discussion between liver team, MICU team and
   family given patient's declining status. Will discuss intubation today,
   although not certain it will happen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and Tylenol overuse. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening renal function, mental status, and respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has been experiencing hypoxia with a SpO2 of 91%. The chest X-ray shows new infiltrates, which could be due to aspiration or edema. The patient is at risk for pneumonia, and considering her current antibiotic regimen, there is a possibility of VRE, fungal, or other ESBL organisms. 

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been trending up, indicating worsening renal function. The FENa is less than 1%, suggesting pre-renal azotemia due to hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome. Albumin infusions have improved her renal function in the past, but it has now deteriorated again. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) treatment has been started and restarted.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She is receiving lactulose and rifaximin. The head CT is negative for any acute intracranial process.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and aspiration.
- They have a history of cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholic anemia.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 118/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 112 to 632 mg/dL.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated lactate levels.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fibersource HN for nutrition.
- The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has been experiencing hypernatremia, coagulopathy, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hepatorenal syndrome, impaired skin integrity, and impaired glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to DVT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and decompensated liver failure, admitted with likely EtOH and Tylenol ingestion. She has multiple complications including altered mental status, acute respiratory failure, hepato-renal syndrome/acute renal failure, and coagulopathy. The patient was unable to stay on the medical floor due to worsening mental status and tachypnea, and was returned to the ICU for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can be attributed to several factors including renal failure, pneumonia, and underlying cirrhosis. It is essential to minimize sedating medications and consider potential causes for the altered mental status.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is showing signs of acute respiratory failure, possibly due to new pneumonia. The presence of a right-sided infiltrate on imaging suggests a pulmonary infection. Intubation may be necessary, and ongoing monitoring of ABG (arterial blood gas) values is important.
3. Hepato-Renal Syndrome/Acute Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels are worsening, indicating possible hepato-renal syndrome or acute renal failure. Close monitoring of bladder pressure is crucial, and treatment with midodrine, octreotide, and albumin should continue.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has evidence of coagulopathy, as indicated by a flank hemat"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back with worsening renal function, mental
   status and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxia: CXR with possible multifocal pna, but has had decreased
   oxygen requirement since narcan. She also completed 9 days of
   vanc/zosyn for SBP thus it would be unlikely that pt developed a new
   PNA. However, VRE, fungal or other ESBL organism is a possibility. Her
   abdominal girth may also be contributing to decreased chest wall
   compliance. Worsening hypoxia overnight [**3-25**], becoming more somnolent,
   able to maintain O2 sats > 90% with 100 FiO2. Improved somewhat with
   Narcan. Satting in mid-90s on 4-5L O2 NC this morning.
   - CXR shows new infiltrate
 aspiration vs edema; will treat with
   Vanc/Zosyn again as this was a new event/infiltrate. Consider VRE
   coverage as well.
   - Will try to avoid intubation as it will likely be very difficult to
   extubated; however OK to intubate if necessary per family.
   - Avoid narcotics (none given since [**3-24**])
   - Repeat bladder pressure (15 this morning)
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated for goal O2 sat >92%
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improved after albumin infusion (x3), which
   argued against HRS.  Cr had normalized x 5 days but again elevated on
   [**3-23**] and is increasing.  HRS treatment was discontinued and has been
   restarted over the last several days.
   - Continue albumin for likely intravascular volume depletion and HRS
   - Continue octreotide , increase midodrine per Liver
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Also persistently hypernatremic which is likely
   contributing to her AMS.  Has been receiving free water and Na is
   stable and mildly elevated.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process.  Appears a bit more altered this morning, but is still
   responsive to voice.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin (stooling well)
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] and Cipro started to complete
   total 2 week abd course. No growth on culture of peritoneal fluid.
   Bladder pressure elevated on morning of [**3-20**], pt increasingly
   uncomfortable and dyspneic. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**] to remove 2.5L
   grossly bloody fluid. Required increasing pain meds [**Date range (1) 5037**] but d/c
   [**3-23**] because no longer complaining of pain.
   - Restarted vanc/Zosyn, but will switch to Cipro after PNA resolves
   - Recheck bladder pressure today with goal < 20mmHg
   .
   # Anemia: Stable after aggressive FFP transfusions. Cause likely
   multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after
   paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Also
   has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely that
   the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low retic
   index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin. GSurgery/
   transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions for now
   - Daily HCT check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis: Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband prior to admission . Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to
   no collateral flow in the portal circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI
   (feels anemia more likely due to hemolysis). D/c
d midodrine/octreotide
   3/25 per liver.
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable and elevated
   - Continue midodrine/octreotide as above
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - Appreciate liver recs, will continue to have ongoing discussion with
   liver team regarding prognosis and likelihood of recovery.
   .
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**], culture growing yeast. On ciprofloxacin.
   Foley changed overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**]. Will follow up on culture and adjust
   abx as needed.  Repeat culture growing yeast.
   - Continue cipro
   - Consider antifungal treatment if patient continues to decompensate,
   though no positive blood cultures
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Decreased D5W to 50cc/hr
   .
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia), PPI
   .
   Access: PIV, PICC (placed [**3-19**])
   .
   Code: Full code.  Ongoing discussion between liver team, MICU team and
   family given patient's declining status. Will discuss intubation today,
   although not certain it will happen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and acetaminophen overuse. She has been admitted to the ICU with worsening renal function, mental status changes, and respiratory distress. The patient has a diagnosis of cirrhosis, likely secondary to alcohol abuse and acetaminophen use. She also has portal vein thrombosis, which appears to be acute. The patient's current conditions include hypoxia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 111/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has a decreased oxygen requirement since receiving Narcan. There is a possibility of multifocal pneumonia, but given the completion of 9 days of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for SBP, a new pneumonia seems unlikely. However, the patient may still be at risk for VRE, fungal, or other ESBL organisms. The abdominal girth may also contribute to decreased chest wall compliance. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back with worsening renal function, mental
   status and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Hypoxia: CXR with possible multifocal pna, but has had decreased
   oxygen requirement since narcan. She also completed 9 days of
   vanc/zosyn for SBP thus it would be unlikely that pt developed a new
   PNA. However, VRE, fungal or other ESBL organism is a possibility. Her
   abdominal girth may also be contributing to decreased chest wall
   compliance. Worsening hypoxia overnight [**3-25**], becoming more somnolent,
   able to maintain O2 sats > 90% with 100 FiO2. Improved somewhat with
   Narcan. Satting in mid-90s on 4-5L O2 NC this morning.
   - CXR shows new infiltrate
 aspiration vs edema; will treat with
   Vanc/Zosyn again as this was a new event/infiltrate. Consider VRE
   coverage as well.
   - Will try to avoid intubation as it will likely be very difficult to
   extubated; however OK to intubate if necessary per family.
   - Avoid narcotics (none given since [**3-24**])
   - Repeat bladder pressure (15 this morning)
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated for goal O2 sat >92%
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improves after albumin infusion (5 infusions
   of 75g each so far), which argues against HRS. HRS treatment was
   discontinued and has been restarted over the last several days.
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine per Liver
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Also persistently hypernatremic which is likely
   contributing to her AMS.  Has been receiving free water and Na is
   stable and mildly elevated.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process.  Appears a bit more altered this morning, but is still
   responsive to voice.
   - Increase lactulose and continue rifaxamin; quantify stool output to
   monitor response
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   .
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Also added Vanc. Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] with
   intention of switching to Cipro, however given new infiltrate on CXR
   along with increasing resp distress Vanc and Zosyn were re-started. No
   growth on culture of peritoneal fluid. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for now, but will switch to Cipro after PNA
   resolves
   - Recheck bladder pressure
   .
   # Anemia: Stable after aggressive FFP transfusions. Cause likely
   multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after
   paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Also
   has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely that
   the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low retic
   index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin. GSurgery/
   transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions for now
   - Daily HCT check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   .
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis: Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband prior to admission . Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to
   no collateral flow in the portal circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI
   (feels anemia more likely due to hemolysis). D/c
d midodrine/octreotide
   3/25 per liver.
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable and elevated
   - Continue midodrine/octreotide as above
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - Appreciate liver recs, will continue to have ongoing discussion with
   liver team regarding prognosis and likelihood of recovery.
   .
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**], culture growing yeast. Foley changed
   overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**].
   - Consider antifungal treatment if patient decompensates, though no
   positive blood cultures
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   bleeding
   .
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Continue D5W at 100cc/hr for now, recheck lytes in afternoon.
   .
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   .
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia), PPI
   .
   Access: PIV, PICC (placed [**3-19**])
   .
   Code: Full code.  Ongoing discussion between liver team, MICU team and
   family given patient's declining status. Poor prognosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse and Tylenol overuse.
- She has been in the MICU for 2 weeks and was transferred back with worsening renal function, mental status, and respiratory distress.
- The patient's condition is complicated by several medical issues, including hypoxia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, portal vein thrombosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and cirrhosis with hyperbilirubinemia.
- The patient's current treatment plan includes increasing midodrine to 5 mg TID, starting lanthanum due to increasing phosphate levels, and adjusting fluid and electrolyte management.
- The patient's family has agreed to intubation if necessary, and there is ongoing discussion about code status due to the patient's declining prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and new infiltrate on CXR suggest a potential pneumonia or worsening of her underlying lung condition. This could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function. This could progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic enceph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, likely secondary to alcohol abuse and Tylenol overuse. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and is currently experiencing worsening renal function, mental status changes, and respiratory distress. The patient's medical history includes alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, portal vein thrombosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxia, which may be due to multifocal pneumonia or aspiration. The patient's oxygen requirement has decreased since Narcan administration, but she still requires supplemental oxygen. A new infiltrate is noted on the chest X-ray, which could indicate a possible infection or edema. Intubation may be necessary if the patient's condition worsens.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been trending up, indicating worsening renal function. She has been treated with albumin infusions and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) treatment. However, her renal function has normalized temporarily but has again become elevated. Continuing albumin infusions, octreotide, and midodrine may be beneficial. Avoiding nephrotoxins and following electrolyte levels are also important.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy and SBP. She is hypernatremic, which could be contributing to her altered mental status. Lactulose and rifaximin should be continued to manage hepatic encephalopathy. Treating hypernatremia and addressing potential causes such as SBP are crucial.

4. SBP: The patient has been diagnosed with SBP and has undergone a therapeutic paracentesis to remove grossly bloody fluid. She has been on ceftriaxone and has completed a two-week abdominal course of antibiotics. No growth was observed on the culture of peritoneal fluid. Rechecking bladder pressure and monitoring for signs of infection or worsening symptoms are essential.

5. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia likely due to intrabdominal bleeding after paracentesis, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Low-grade GI bleeding has also been identified. It is important to monitor the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and transfuse as needed.

6. Cirrhosis/Hyperbilirubinemia/Portal Vein Thrombosis: The patient has cirrhosis secondary to alcoholism, with exacerbation from chronic acetaminophen use. She has stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, leg edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR. Portal vein thrombosis seems acute, and it is important to follow liver"

The patient's current conditions include hypoxia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, cirrhosis with portal vein thrombosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and possible TTP/DIC.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, which may worsen her respiratory distress. She requires close monitoring with ABG for worsening hypoxemia and hypercarbia. Intubation may be necessary.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, indicating worsening renal function. She should continue receiving albumin infusions for intravascular volume depletion and hepatorenal syndrome. Octreotide and midodrine should be continued as well.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy and SBP"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 yo female with history of cirrhosis and admit with decompensated
   liver failure with likely EtOH and Tylenol ingestion triggering
   worsening.  She had ongoing active issues of altered mental status,
   renal failure and coagulopathy with blood loss anemia dominating
   picture.  She was unable to stay on medical floor due to worsening
   mental status/tachypnea and return to ICU for further care.  Notable
   issues:
   Cirrhosis
Multiple complications related to hepatic failure continued
   Altered Mental Status-
   -Rifax/Lactulose with no improvement, will increase lactulose
   - likely due in part to renal failure, pneumonia, underlying cirrhosis
   Acute respiratory failure
   -some concern for new pneumonia but fevers/coughs not prominent
   although has right sided infiltrate
this is in the setting of NGT
   changes in position. Agree with continuing Vanco/Zosyn. [**Month (only) 11**] need
   intubation. Will repeat ABG
   Hepato-Renal Syndrome/Acute Renal Failure
   - BUN worsening, recheck bladder pressure
   -Midodrine/Octreotide/Albumin to continue today
   Coagulopathy
   - She has flank hematoma noted on left in area of para but HCT remains
   stable
   Very poor prognosis. Goals of care need to be addressed regularly with
   family. Currently full code but would not expect a meaningful recovery
   in the event of a cardiopulmonary arrest.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis who was admitted with decompensated liver failure. The patient likely ingested ethanol and Tylenol, which worsened her condition. She has ongoing issues including altered mental status, renal failure, and coagulopathy with blood loss anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing worsening mental status, which could be due to various factors such as hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, pneumonia, or underlying cirrhosis. Treatment includes increasing lactulose and considering other interventions.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to new pneumonia or fluid accumulation in the lungs. There is a right-sided infiltrate seen on imaging, and the patient may require intubation and mechanical ventilation.

3. Hepato-renal syndrome/acute renal failure: The patient's BUN levels are worsening, indicating potential acute renal failure. Close monitoring of bladder pressure is necessary, and treatments like midodrine, octreotide, and albumin may be considered.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a flank hematoma and evidence of coagulopathy. Monitoring HCT levels and appropriate coagulation management are crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back with worsening renal function, mental
   status and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia: CXR with possible multifocal pna, but has had decreased
   oxygen requirement since narcan. She also completed 9 days of
   vanc/zosyn for SBP thus it would be unlikely that pt developed a new
   PNA. However, VRE, fungal or other ESBL organism is a possibility. Her
   abdominal girth may also be contributing to decreased chest wall
   compliance. Worsening hypoxia overnight [**3-25**], becoming more somnolent,
   able to maintain O2 sats > 90% with 100 FiO2. Improved somewhat with
   Narcan. Satting in mid-90s on 4-5L O2 NC this morning.
   - CXR shows new infiltrate
 aspiration vs edema; will treat with
   Vanc/Zosyn again as this was a new event/infiltrate. Consider VRE
   coverage as well.
   - Will try to avoid intubation as it will likely be very difficult to
   extubated; however OK to intubate if necessary per family.
   - Avoid narcotics (none given since [**3-24**])
   - Repeat bladder pressure (15 this morning)
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated for goal O2 sat >92%
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improves after albumin infusion (5 infusions
   of 75g each so far), which argues against HRS. HRS treatment was
   discontinued and has been restarted over the last several days.
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine per Liver
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Also persistently hypernatremic which is likely
   contributing to her AMS.  Has been receiving free water and Na is
   stable and mildly elevated.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process.  Appears a bit more altered this morning, but is still
   responsive to voice.
   - Increase lactulose and continue rifaxamin; quantify stool output to
   monitor response
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Also added Vanc. Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] with
   intention of switching to Cipro, however given new infiltrate on CXR
   along with increasing resp distress Vanc and Zosyn were re-started. No
   growth on culture of peritoneal fluid. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for now, but will switch to Cipro after PNA
   resolves
   - Recheck bladder pressure
   # Anemia: Stable after aggressive FFP transfusions. Cause likely
   multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after
   paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Also
   has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely that
   the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low retic
   index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin. GSurgery/
   transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions for now
   - Daily HCT check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis: Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband prior to admission . Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to
   no collateral flow in the portal circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI
   (feels anemia more likely due to hemolysis). D/c
d midodrine/octreotide
   3/25 per liver.
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable and elevated
   - Continue midodrine/octreotide as above
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - Appreciate liver recs, will continue to have ongoing discussion with
   liver team regarding prognosis and likelihood of recovery.
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**], culture growing yeast. Foley changed
   overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**].
   - Consider antifungal treatment if patient decompensates, though no
   positive blood cultures
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   bleeding
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Continue D5W at 100cc/hr for now, recheck lytes in afternoon.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, TF per nutrition recs, ISS
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (no HSQ given elevated INR and
   thrombocytopenia), PPI
   Access: PIV, PICC (placed [**3-19**])
   Code: Full code.  Ongoing discussion between liver team, MICU team and

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse and Tylenol overuse. She has been admitted to the ICU for worsening renal function, mental status, and respiratory distress. The patient's conditions include hypoxia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, portal vein thrombosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and new infiltrate on CXR indicate the possibility of pneumonia. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and respiratory function.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and low urine output suggest worsening kidney function. This can progress to complete renal failure if not managed appropriately.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status changes may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, or electrolyte imbalances. If not addressed, it can lead to increased levels of confusion, disorientation, and potentially coma.

4. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Although the patient has received treatment for SBP, there is a risk of recurrence. Early recognition and prompt antibiotic therapy are crucial to prevent further complications.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be multifactorial, including chronic disease,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back with worsening renal function, mental
   status and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia: CXR with possible multifocal pna, but has had decreased
   oxygen requirement since narcan. She also completed 9 days of
   vanc/zosyn for SBP thus it would be unlikely that pt developed a new
   PNA. However, VRE, fungal or other ESBL organism is a possibility. Her
   abdominal girth may also be contributing to decreased chest wall
   compliance. Worsening hypoxia overnight [**3-25**], becoming more somnolent,
   able to maintain O2 sats > 90% with 100 FiO2. Improved somewhat with
   Narcan. Satting in mid-90s on 4-5L O2 NC this morning.
   - CXR shows new infiltrate
 aspiration vs edema; will treat with
   Vanc/Zosyn again as this was a new event/infiltrate. Consider VRE
   coverage as well.
   - Will try to avoid intubation as it will likely be very difficult to
   extubated; however OK to intubate if necessary per family.
   - Avoid narcotics (none given since [**3-24**])
   - Repeat bladder pressure (15 this morning)
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated for goal O2 sat >92%
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improves after albumin infusion (5 infusions
   of 75g each so far), which argues against HRS. HRS treatment was
   discontinued and has been restarted over the last several days.
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine per Liver
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Also persistently hypernatremic which is likely
   contributing to her AMS.  Has been receiving free water and Na is
   stable and mildly elevated.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process.  Appears a bit more altered this morning, but is still
   responsive to voice.
   - Increase lactulose and continue rifaxamin; quantify stool output to
   monitor response
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Also added Vanc. Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] with
   intention of switching to Cipro, however given new infiltrate on CXR
   along with increasing resp distress Vanc and Zosyn were re-started. No
   growth on culture of peritoneal fluid. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for now, but will switch to Cipro after PNA
   resolves
   - Recheck bladder pressure
   # Anemia: Stable after aggressive FFP transfusions. Cause likely
   multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after
   paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Also
   has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely that
   the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low retic
   index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin. GSurgery/
   transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions for now
   - Daily HCT check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis: Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband prior to admission . Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to
   no collateral flow in the portal circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI
   (feels anemia more likely due to hemolysis). D/c
d midodrine/octreotide
   3/25 per liver.
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable and elevated
   - Continue midodrine/octreotide as above
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - Appreciate liver recs, will continue to have ongoing discussion with
   liver team regarding prognosis and likelihood of recovery.
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**], culture growing yeast. Foley changed
   overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**].
   - Consider antifungal treatment if patient decompensates, though no
   positive blood cultures
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   bleeding
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Continue D5W at 100cc/hr for now, recheck lytes in afternoon.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse and acetaminophen overuse. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and is currently experiencing worsening renal function, altered mental status, respiratory distress, and new infiltrate on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has a decreased oxygen requirement since receiving Narcan. There is a possibility of pneumonia, especially with the presence of new infiltrates on the chest X-ray. The patient may require intubation if necessary, but efforts will be made to avoid it.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has been trending upward, indicating worsening renal function. Pre-renal causes such as hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome should be considered. Albumin infusions have helped improve renal function, suggesting that hepatorenal syndrome is a possible cause. Treatment includes continuing octreotide and midodrine, following hospital guidelines for electrolytes, and avoiding nephrotoxins.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of increased alertness and responsiveness. Hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) are likely contributing factors. Treatment includes increasing lactulose and continuing rifaximin, as well as monitoring stool output.

4. SBP: The patient had SBP previously and received treatment"

   Microbiology:

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back on [**3-25**] with worsening renal function,
   mental status, and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia:
   This AM in 98% on 6L NC.  CXR with question of multifocal PNA.
   Currently good coverage for HAP, although VRE, fungal or other ESBL
   organism is a possibility. Is now on new 8 day course of Vanc/Zosyn
   with initiation on [**2174-3-25**].  Overall very sensitive to narcotics and
   they should not be used due to extreme respiratory depression. Likely
   some component of impaired mechanics due to abdominal girth; however,
   correlation with O2 requirement and bladder pressures has not been
   drawn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn with final day being [**2174-4-1**].
   - Liberate from supplemental oxygen as tolerated
   - Likely no need for additional bladder pressure measure as hypoxia
   persists despite reasonable pressures
   # Acute renal failure:
   Resolving with Cr of 0.8 this AM down from 1.9 on evening of [**2174-3-26**].
   Has been managed with albumin infusion (5 of 75g thus far) as well as
   octreotide and midodrine. Despite this, low likelihood of HRS.
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine for one additional day (last dose
   [**2174-3-29**])
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # Altered mental status:
   Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**], though overall more awake today than previous.
   Likely multifactorial with hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, uremia,
   hypernatremia. Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process.
   - Increase lactulose to QID and continue rifaxamin; quantify stool
   output to monitor response.
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   # SBP:
   Has been exposed to many antibiotics at this point.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for planned course ending [**2174-4-1**], but will
   switch to Cipro for suppression after that course is complete.
   # Hypernatremia:
   This in setting of hyponatremia initially. Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Continue D5W at 150cc/hr for now
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Anemia:
   Stable at approx 26 in last 4 days s/p aggressive FFP transfusions s/p
   intraabdominal bleeding. Cause likely multifactorial, biggest
   contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after paracenteses,
   superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Hemolysis unlikely
   to be contributing given past lab data. Also, has low grade GI bleed
   (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody).
   - Daily HCT check
   - Goal Hct is 21 if stable, will titrate transfusions if responding
   appropriately to blood.
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis:
   Patient w/ mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia,
   ascites, LE edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is
   likely secondary to cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from
   chronic acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per
   patient and husband prior to admission . Portal vein thrombosis seems

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse and Tylenol overuse. She was admitted to the MICU two weeks ago and has been experiencing worsening renal function, mental status changes, and respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with hypoxia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypernatremia, anemia, cirrhosis with portal vein thrombosis, and a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has a low oxygen saturation level despite being on supplemental oxygen. Multifocal pneumonia is suspected based on the chest X-ray.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved from 1.9 to 0.8 mg/dL, indicating resolving renal failure. She has been managed with albumin infusion, octreotide, and midodrine. Low likelihood of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, likely due to a combination of hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, uremia, and hypernatremia. Head CT showed no acute intracranial process.
4. SBP: The patient has been exposed to many antibiotics, so it is important to continue Vanc/Zosyn for planned course ending on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver and alcoholic anemia. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments for his conditions, including antibiotics, pain control, hypernatremia correction, coagulopathy management, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory function is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of aspiration pneumonia increases the risk of bacterial infection. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or production of purulent secretions, is essential. Prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is necessary.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were corrected with D5W, but it is important to monitor his sodium levels closely to avoid complications associated with rapid correction, such as cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has evidence of coagulopathy, as indicated by abnormal coagulation studies (PTT, INR) and low platelet count. Close monitoring of bleeding tendencies and prompt management of any bleeding episodes are necessary.

5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Monitoring hemoglobin/hematoc"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and alcoholism. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing abdominal and leg pain, and his mental status has fluctuated. His sodium levels were high, so he was given D5W to correct hypernatremia. The patient's oxygen saturation improved with the use of supplemental oxygen. He received antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin) and antacids (lansoprazole) for his condition.

Vital signs show that the patient's temperature is within normal range, but his blood pressure is low, and his heart rate is on the higher end of the normal range. His respiratory rate is decreased, and his oxygen saturation is stable at 98% with the use of a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, dry oropharynx, supple neck with no JVP elevation, clear lungs, regular heart sounds with a systolic murmur, distended abdomen, and significant bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient is warm and well perfused.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. Liver enzymes such as AST and ALT are elevated. Other lab values, including electroly"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back with worsening renal function, mental
   status and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia: CXR with possible multifocal pna, but has had decreased
   oxygen requirement since narcan. She also completed 9 days of
   vanc/zosyn for SBP thus it would be unlikely that pt developed a new
   PNA. However, VRE, fungal or other ESBL organism is a possibility. Her
   abdominal girth may also be contributing to decreased chest wall
   compliance. Worsening hypoxia overnight [**3-25**], becoming more somnolent,
   able to maintain O2 sats > 90% with 100 FiO2. Improved somewhat with
   Narcan. Satting in mid-90s on 4-5L O2 NC this morning.
   - CXR shows new infiltrate
 aspiration vs edema; will treat with
   Vanc/Zosyn again as this was a new event/infiltrate. Consider VRE
   coverage as well.
   - Will try to avoid intubation as it will likely be very difficult to
   extubated; however OK to intubate if necessary per family.
   - Avoid narcotics (none given since [**3-24**])
   - Repeat bladder pressure (15 this morning)
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated for goal O2 sat >92%
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improves after albumin infusion (5 infusions
   of 75g each so far), which argues against HRS. HRS treatment was
   discontinued and has been restarted over the last several days.
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine per Liver
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Also persistently hypernatremic which is likely
   contributing to her AMS.  Has been receiving free water and Na is
   stable and mildly elevated.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process.  Appears a bit more altered this morning, but is still
   responsive to voice.
   - Increase lactulose and continue rifaxamin; quantify stool output to
   monitor response
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Also added Vanc. Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] with
   intention of switching to Cipro, however given new infiltrate on CXR
   along with increasing resp distress Vanc and Zosyn were re-started. No
   growth on culture of peritoneal fluid. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for now, but will switch to Cipro after PNA
   resolves
   - Recheck bladder pressure
   # Anemia: Stable after aggressive FFP transfusions. Cause likely
   multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after
   paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Also
   has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely that
   the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low retic
   index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin. GSurgery/
   transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions for now
   - Daily HCT check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis: Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband prior to admission . Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to
   no collateral flow in the portal circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI
   (feels anemia more likely due to hemolysis). D/c
d midodrine/octreotide
   3/25 per liver.
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable and elevated
   - Continue midodrine/octreotide as above
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - Appreciate liver recs, will continue to have ongoing discussion with
   liver team regarding prognosis and likelihood of recovery.
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**], culture growing yeast. Foley changed
   overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**].
   - Consider antifungal treatment if patient decompensates, though no
   positive blood cultures
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   bleeding
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Continue D5W at 100cc/hr for now, recheck lytes in afternoon.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and acetaminophen overuse. She has been in the MICU for two weeks and is now back in the ICU with worsening renal function, mental status, and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is presumed to have developed liver failure. She also has ascites, leg edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR, which are indicative of portal vein thrombosis. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and new infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for this condition.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been trending upwards, indicating worsening renal function. Measures are being taken to manage fluid balance and correct hypernatremia.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, likely secondary to liver failure. Treatment includes increasing lactulose and continuing rifaximin, as well as addressing potential contributing factors such as hyper"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back on [**3-25**] with worsening renal function,
   mental status, and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia:
   This AM in 98% on 6L NC.  CXR with question of multifocal PNA.
   Currently good coverage for HAP, although VRE, fungal or other ESBL
   organism is a possibility. Is now on new 8 day course of Vanc/Zosyn
   with initiation on [**2174-3-25**].  Overall very sensitive to narcotics and
   they should not be used due to extreme respiratory depression. Likely
   some component of impaired mechanics due to abdominal girth; however,
   correlation with O2 requirement and bladder pressures has not been
   drawn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn with final day being [**2174-4-1**].
   - Liberate from supplemental oxygen as tolerated
   - Likely no need for additional bladder pressure measure as hypoxia
   persists despite reasonable pressures
   # Acute renal failure:
   Resolving with Cr of 0.8 this AM down from 1.9 on evening of [**2174-3-26**].
   Has been managed with albumin infusion (5 of 75g thus far) as well as
   octreotide and midodrine. Despite this, low likelihood of HRS. Despite
   improving Cr, BUN remains elevated to 100 this AM.
   - Research further causes of isolated uremia
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine for one additional day (last dose
   [**2174-3-29**])
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # Altered mental status:
   Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**], though overall more awake today than previous.
   Likely multifactorial with hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, uremia,
   hypernatremia. Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process.
   - Increase lactulose to QID and continue rifaxamin; quantify stool
   output to monitor response.
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   # SBP:
   Has been exposed to many antibiotics at this point.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for planned course ending [**2174-4-1**], but will
   switch to Cipro for suppression after that course is complete.
   # Hypernatremia:
   This in setting of hyponatremia initially. Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Continue D5W at 150cc/hr for now
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Anemia:
   Stable at approx 26 in last 4 days s/p aggressive FFP transfusions s/p
   intraabdominal bleeding. Cause likely multifactorial, biggest
   contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after paracenteses,
   superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Hemolysis unlikely
   to be contributing given past lab data. Also, has low grade GI bleed
   (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody).
   - Daily HCT check
   - Goal Hct is 21 if stable, will titrate transfusions if responding
   appropriately to blood.
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis:
   Liver enzymes stable elevation, Tbili with stable elevation. INR
   increasing daily and is 2.8 today.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic acetaminophen
   use. Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in
   the portal circulation on CT.
   - Follow liver enzymes and bilirubin daily
   - Continue midodrine/octreotide for one additional day as above
   - Minimize non-essential meds
   - Appreciate onoing hepatology input.
   - Transfer to hepatology team later today if they agree with eval that
   she is stable for floor care
   # UTI:
   Positive U/A on [**3-23**], culture growing yeast. Foley changed overnight
   [**Date range (1) 5037**].
   - Consider antifungal treatment if patient decompensates, though no
   positive blood cultures
   #  Thrombocytopenia.
   Imiproving from 30s to 76 this AM. Likely secondary to liver failure
   and splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret
   with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   bleeding
   #.  H/O alcohol abuse:
   Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - Continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and Tylenol overuse. She has been in the MICU for two weeks and was transferred back with worsening renal function, mental status, and respiratory distress. The patient's chief complaint is abdominal and leg pain overnight.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4 C (99.3 F)
- Heart rate: 89 bpm (87-101 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 113/57 mmHg (70-131/67 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 10 breaths per minute (7-22 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on 4-5 L O2 NC

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is suspected to have developed cirrhosis. She also has a history of acetaminophen overdose, which has contributed to her liver damage. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and has been treated with albumin infusions, octreotide, and midodrine.

The patient's mental status is altered, and she is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. She has been treated with lactulose and rifaximin. The patient has been exposed to multiple antibiotics, and there is a concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back with worsening renal function, mental
   status and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia: CXR with possible multifocal pna, but has had decreased
   oxygen requirement since narcan. She also completed 9 days of
   vanc/zosyn for SBP thus it would be unlikely that pt developed a new
   PNA. However, VRE, fungal or other ESBL organism is a possibility. Her
   abdominal girth may also be contributing to decreased chest wall
   compliance. Worsening hypoxia overnight [**3-25**], becoming more somnolent,
   able to maintain O2 sats > 90% with 100 FiO2. Improved somewhat with
   Narcan. Satting in mid-90s on 4-5L O2 NC this morning.
   - CXR shows new infiltrate
 aspiration vs edema; will treat with
   Vanc/Zosyn again as this was a new event/infiltrate. Consider VRE
   coverage as well.
   - Will try to avoid intubation as it will likely be very difficult to
   extubated; however OK to intubate if necessary per family.
   - Avoid narcotics (none given since [**3-24**])
   - Repeat bladder pressure (15 this morning)
   - Wean supplemental O2 as tolerated for goal O2 sat >92%
   # Acute renal failure: Cr trended up to peak of 3.0 previously. FENa
   <1%, thus pre-renal due to hypovolemia (large stool output) or
   hepatorenal syndrome. Cr improves after albumin infusion (5 infusions
   of 75g each so far), which argues against HRS. HRS treatment was
   discontinued and has been restarted over the last several days.
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine per Liver
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # Altered mental status. Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**]. Likely hepatic
   encephalopathy and SBP. Also persistently hypernatremic which is likely
   contributing to her AMS.  Has been receiving free water and Na is
   stable and mildly elevated.  Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial
   process.  Appears a bit more altered this morning, but is still
   responsive to voice.
   - Increase lactulose and continue rifaxamin; quantify stool output to
   monitor response
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   # SBP: Received Unasyn x 3 days at OSH for SBP Prophylaxis. Started
   Ceftriaxone upon arrival here. S/P diagnostic paracentesis - Second tap
   showed incr WBC with L shift, changed CTX to Zosyn on [**3-15**], per
   informal ID recs.  Also added Vanc. Vanc/Zosyn d/c
d [**3-23**] with
   intention of switching to Cipro, however given new infiltrate on CXR
   along with increasing resp distress Vanc and Zosyn were re-started. No
   growth on culture of peritoneal fluid. Therapeutic para done [**3-20**] to
   remove 2.5L grossly bloody fluid.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for now, but will switch to Cipro after PNA
   resolves
   - Recheck bladder pressure
   # Anemia: Stable after aggressive FFP transfusions. Cause likely
   multifactorial, biggest contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after
   paracenteses, superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Also
   has low grade GI bleed (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody). Unlikely that
   the patient has DIC/hemolysis, since lab data underwhelming - low retic
   index, direct bilirubinemia, normal LDH, normal haptoglobin. GSurgery/
   transplant surgery recs: no OR.
   - Will hold off on further FFP transfusions for now
   - Daily HCT check
   - Will treat supportively with blood products. Goal Hct is 21 if
   stable, will titrate transfusions if responding appropriately to blood.
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis: Patient w/
   mild transaminitis (stable) with stable thrombocytopenia, ascites, LE
   edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and elevated INR.  This is likely secondary
   to cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic
   acetaminophen use.  Currently not drinking for 1 month per patient and
   husband prior to admission . Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to
   no collateral flow in the portal circulation on CT. EGD deferred by GI
   (feels anemia more likely due to hemolysis). D/c
d midodrine/octreotide
   3/25 per liver.
   - Follow liver enzymes
 bilirubin stable and elevated
   - Continue midodrine/octreotide as above
   - minimize non-essential meds
   - Appreciate liver recs, will continue to have ongoing discussion with
   liver team regarding prognosis and likelihood of recovery.
   # UTI: Positive U/A on [**3-23**], culture growing yeast. Foley changed
   overnight [**Date range (1) 5037**].
   - Consider antifungal treatment if patient decompensates, though no
   positive blood cultures
   #  Thrombocytopenia. Improved. Likely secondary to liver failure and
   splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with
   liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   bleeding
   # Hypernatremia after initial hyponatremia: Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Mix meds in D5W
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Continue D5W at 100cc/hr for now, recheck lytes in afternoon.
   #.  H/o alcohol abuse. Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, presumed secondary to alcohol abuse and Tylenol overuse. She was admitted to the ICU for worsening renal function, mental status changes, and respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, portal vein thrombosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory distress and new infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Treatment with Vanc/Zosyn has been restarted, considering the new event/infiltrate. The patient may require intubation if necessary.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has trended up, indicating worsening renal function. Pre-renal causes such as hypovolemia or hepatorenal syndrome are possible, but the improvement after albumin infusion argues against hepatorenal syndrome. Treatment includes continuing octreotide and midodrine, following hospital guidelines for electrolyte management, and avoiding nephrotoxins.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status changes may be due to hepatic encephalopathy and SBP. Treating hypernatremia, increasing lactulose, and monitoring stool output are recommended. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back on [**3-25**] with worsening renal function,
   mental status, and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia:
   This AM in 96% on 4L NC.  CXR with question of multifocal PNA.
   Currently good coverage for HAP, although VRE, fungal or other ESBL
   organism is a possibility. Is now on new 8 day course of Vanc/Zosyn
   with initiation on [**2174-3-25**], will be stopped on [**2174-4-1**].  Very
   sensitive to narcotics and they should not be used due to extreme
   respiratory depression. Likely some component of impaired mechanics due
   to abdominal girth. Was being followed with bladder pressures; however,
   none performed in last 24 hours. No acute change in respiratory status
   yesterday, will conservatively consider need for repeat paracentesis if
   resp status worsens given recent severe hemorrhage with paracentesis.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn with final day being [**2174-4-1**].
   - Continue to liberate from supplemental oxygen as tolerated.
   - Pulmonary hygiene
   # Acute renal failure:
   Unknown true baseline Cr; however [**Last Name (un) 2406**] overall resolving with stable Cr
   of 1.0 this AM down from 1.9 on evening of [**2174-3-26**]. Has been managed
   with albumin infusion (5 of 75g thus far) as well as octreotide and
   midodrine. Despite stable Cr, BUN remains elevated to 101 this AM.
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine and defer to hepatology for further
   management
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # Altered mental status:
   Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**], though overall more awake today than yesterday AM as
   she is answering questions well after delay in response. Likely
   multifactorial with hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, uremia, hypernatremia.
   Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process.
   - Continue lactulose titrated to stool output and continue rifaxamin.
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   # SBP:
   Has been exposed to many antibiotics at this point.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for planned course ending [**2174-4-1**], but will
   switch to Cipro for suppression after that course is complete.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Patient with normal sodium at 143 this AM. Will monitor to assure no
   acute or too-rapid fall in sodium.
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Continue diluted tube feeds to
 strength to increase free water
   delivery.
   - Can discontinue D5W infusion and continue to monitor sodium [**Hospital1 **]
   # Anemia:
   Stable at approx 26 in last 5 days s/p aggressive FFP transfusions s/p
   intra-abdominal bleeding. Cause likely multifactorial, biggest
   contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after paracentesis,
   superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Hemolysis unlikely
   to be contributing given past lab data. Also, has low grade GI bleed
   (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody).
   - Daily HCT check
   - Goal HCT is 21 if stable, will titrate transfusions if responding
   appropriately to blood.
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis:
   Liver enzymes stable elevation, Tbili with stable elevation. INR
   increasing daily and is 3.1 today.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic acetaminophen
   use. Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in
   the portal circulation on CT.
   - Follow liver enzymes and bilirubin daily
   - Continue midodrine / octreotide for now
   - Minimize non-essential meds
   - Appreciate onoing hepatology input.
   - Transfer to hepatology team later today if they agree with eval that
   she is stable for floor care
   - Will need ongoing discussion about possibility of liver transplant
   pending ongoing improvement
   # UTI:
   Positive U/A on [**3-23**], culture growing yeast. Foley changed overnight
   [**Date range (1) 5037**].
   - Consider antifungal treatment if patient decompensates, though no
   positive blood cultures
   #  Thrombocytopenia.
   Improving from 30s at admission to 70s in last two mornings.
   Thrombocytopenia likely secondary to liver failure and splenomegaly.
   Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret with liver failure.

","The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis, likely due to alcohol abuse and Tylenol overuse. She has been in the MICU for two weeks and was transferred back with worsening renal function, mental status, and respiratory distress. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and has a question of multifocal pneumonia on chest X-ray. She is currently on a new 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The possibility of VRE, fungal, or other ESBL organisms should be considered. The patient is sensitive to narcotics, so they should not be used due to extreme respiratory depression. The patient may have impaired mechanics due to abdominal girth, and no acute change in respiratory status was noted yesterday.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's true baseline creatinine is unknown, but it is resolving with a stable creatinine level of 1.0 this morning, down from 1.9 on the evening of 03/26. The patient has been managed with albumin infusion and octreotide and midodrine. The BUN remains elevated at 101 this morning. Renal dosing of medications should be continued, and nephrotoxins should be avoided.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is waxing and waning but is more awake today than"

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with complaints of altered mental status (AMS) and jaundice. They have a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic anemia, and hemolytic anemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/64 mmHg to 123/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of AMS and jaundice. Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,699 mL and output of 3,610 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,089 mL. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, and the patient's ABG results are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's unresponsive state, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic functions. Lab results indicate hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin levels, and abnormal coagulation parameters (PT/PTT/INR).

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Pain control for acute and chronic pain.
3. Hypernatremia (high sodium levels).

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back on [**3-25**] with worsening renal function,
   mental status, and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia:
   This AM in 98% on 6L NC.  CXR with question of multifocal PNA.
   Currently good coverage for HAP, although VRE, fungal or other ESBL
   organism is a possibility. Is now on new 8 day course of Vanc/Zosyn
   with initiation on [**2174-3-25**].  Overall very sensitive to narcotics and
   they should not be used due to extreme respiratory depression. Likely
   some component of impaired mechanics due to abdominal girth; however,
   correlation with O2 requirement and bladder pressures has not been
   drawn.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn with final day being [**2174-4-1**].
   - Liberate from supplemental oxygen as tolerated
   - Likely no need for additional bladder pressure measure as hypoxia
   persists despite reasonable pressures
   # Acute renal failure:
   Resolving with Cr of 0.8 this AM down from 1.9 on evening of [**2174-3-26**].
   Has been managed with albumin infusion (5 of 75g thus far) as well as
   octreotide and midodrine. Despite this, low likelihood of HRS. Despite
   improving Cr, BUN remains elevated to 100 this AM.
   - Research further causes of isolated uremia
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine for one additional day (last dose
   [**2174-3-29**])
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # Altered mental status:
   Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**], though overall more awake today than previous.
   Likely multifactorial with hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, uremia,
   hypernatremia. Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process.
   - Increase lactulose to QID and continue rifaxamin; quantify stool
   output to monitor response.
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   # SBP:
   Has been exposed to many antibiotics at this point.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for planned course ending [**2174-4-1**], but will
   switch to Cipro for suppression after that course is complete.
   # Hypernatremia:
   This in setting of hyponatremia initially. Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Continue D5W at 150cc/hr for now
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Anemia:
   Stable at approx 26 in last 4 days s/p aggressive FFP transfusions s/p
   intraabdominal bleeding. Cause likely multifactorial, biggest
   contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after paracenteses,
   superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Hemolysis unlikely
   to be contributing given past lab data. Also, has low grade GI bleed
   (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody).
   - Daily HCT check
   - Goal Hct is 21 if stable, will titrate transfusions if responding
   appropriately to blood.
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis:
   Liver enzymes stable elevation, Tbili with stable elevation. INR
   increasing daily and is 2.8 today.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic acetaminophen
   use. Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in
   the portal circulation on CT.
   - Follow liver enzymes and bilirubin daily
   - Continue midodrine/octreotide for one additional day as above
   - Minimize non-essential meds
   - Appreciate onoing hepatology input.
   - Transfer to hepatology team later today if they agree with eval that
   she is stable for floor care
   # UTI:
   Positive U/A on [**3-23**], culture growing yeast. Foley changed overnight
   [**Date range (1) 5037**].
   - Consider antifungal treatment if patient decompensates, though no
   positive blood cultures
   #  Thrombocytopenia.
   Imiproving from 30s to 76 this AM. Likely secondary to liver failure
   and splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret
   with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   bleeding
   #.  H/O alcohol abuse:
   Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - Continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and Tylenol overuse. She has been admitted to the ICU with worsening renal function, mental status, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently on an 8-day course of Vanc/Zosyn for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia, and supplemental oxygen is being provided as tolerated. Her acute renal failure is resolving, with a creatinine level of 0.8 this morning, down from 1.9 on the evening of 03/26. The patient has been managed with albumin infusion and octreotide/midodrine, which will be discontinued tomorrow. Her altered mental status is multifactorial, including hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), uremia, and hypernatremia. The patient has been exposed to multiple antibiotics, so coverage for VRE, fungal, or other ESBL organism is a possibility. She is also experiencing anemia, likely due to intrabdominal bleeding after paracentesis, as well as hyperbilirubinemia and portal vein thrombosis. The patient's liver enzymes are stable, but the INR is increasing daily. She is expected to be transferred to the hepatology team later today if she is stable for floor care."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 44 year old female with cirrhosis presumed secondary to
   alcohol abuse and tylenol overuse who is status post a 2 week stay in
   the MICU and is transferred back on [**3-25**] with worsening renal function,
   mental status, and respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxia:
   This AM in 98% on 6L NC.  CXR with question of multifocal PNA.
   Currently good coverage for HAP, although VRE, fungal or other ESBL
   organism is a possibility. Is now on new 8 day course of Vanc/Zosyn
   with initiation on [**2174-3-25**].  Overall very sensitive to narcotics and
   they should not be used due to extreme respiratory depression. Likely
   some component of impaired mechanics due to abdominal girth. Is being
   followed with bladder pressures.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn with final day being [**2174-4-1**].
   - Liberate from supplemental oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue to monitor bladder pressures.
   # Acute renal failure:
   Resolving with Cr of 0.8 this AM down from 1.9 on evening of [**2174-3-26**].
   Has been managed with albumin infusion (5 of 75g thus far) as well as
   octreotide and midodrine. Despite this, low likelihood of HRS. Despite
   improving Cr, BUN remains elevated to 100 this AM.
   - Research further causes of isolated uremia
   - Continue octreotide, midodrine for one additional day (last dose
   [**2174-3-29**])
   - Follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # Altered mental status:
   Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**], though overall more awake today than previous.
   Likely multifactorial with hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, uremia,
   hypernatremia. Head CT on [**3-13**] neg for acute intracranial process.
   - Increase lactulose to QID and continue rifaxamin; quantify stool
   output to monitor response.
   - Treat hypernatremia as below
   # SBP:
   Has been exposed to many antibiotics at this point.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for planned course ending [**2174-4-1**], but will
   switch to Cipro for suppression after that course is complete.
   # Hypernatremia:
   This in setting of hyponatremia initially. Initial hypoNa likely
   secondary to ascites and LE edema. Suspect pt became hyperNa due to TF.
   - Cont free water flushes to 300cc Q4hrs
   - Continue D5W at 150cc/hr for now
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Anemia:
   Stable at approx 26 in last 4 days s/p aggressive FFP transfusions s/p
   intraabdominal bleeding. Cause likely multifactorial, biggest
   contributor being intrabdominal bleeding after paracenteses,
   superimposed on baseline anemia of chronic disease. Hemolysis unlikely
   to be contributing given past lab data. Also, has low grade GI bleed
   (guaiac pos, not grossly bloody).
   - Daily HCT check
   - Goal Hct is 21 if stable, will titrate transfusions if responding
   appropriately to blood.
   # Cirrhosis / hyperbilirubinemia / portal vein thrombosis:
   Liver enzymes stable elevation, Tbili with stable elevation. INR
   increasing daily and is 2.8 today.  This is likely secondary to
   cirrhosis from alcoholism with exacerbation from chronic acetaminophen
   use. Portal vein thrombosis seems acute due to no collateral flow in
   the portal circulation on CT.
   - Follow liver enzymes and bilirubin daily
   - Continue midodrine/octreotide for one additional day as above
   - Minimize non-essential meds
   - Appreciate onoing hepatology input.
   - Transfer to hepatology team later today if they agree with eval that
   she is stable for floor care
   # UTI:
   Positive U/A on [**3-23**], culture growing yeast. Foley changed overnight
   [**Date range (1) 5037**].
   - Consider antifungal treatment if patient decompensates, though no
   positive blood cultures
   #  Thrombocytopenia.
   Imiproving from 30s to 76 this AM. Likely secondary to liver failure
   and splenomegaly.  Evaluation for TTP and DIC difficult to interpret
   with liver failure.  Rare schistocytes on smear with elevated PTT, low
   fibrinogen, and direct hyperbilirubinemia.  However, LDH normal,
   arguing against TMA. E. coli O175:H7 neg argues against TTP/HUS.
   - Follow plt count and transfuse if plt < 10 or as needed to control
   bleeding
   #.  H/O alcohol abuse:
   Completed 5 days of high dose thiamine.
   - Continue multivitamins, folate
   - SW consult when mental status improves

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and requires supplemental oxygen. There is a concern for multifocal pneumonia, and the patient is on a new course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam to cover for hospital-acquired pathogens including VRE, fungal, or ESBL organisms.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels were initially high but have improved from 1.9 to 0.8. Albumin infusion and octreotide/midodrine have been given to improve renal function. However, the patient still has elevated BUN levels, and further investigation into the causes of isolated uremia is needed.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is waxing and waning, and it is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), uremia, and hypernatremia. Lactulose has been increased, and rifaximin has been continued to treat hepatic encephalopathy.

4. SBP: The patient has been exposed to many antibiotics, and Vanc/Zosyn will be continued until [2174-4-1]. After that, the patient will be switched to ciprofloxacin for suppression.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were initially low"
