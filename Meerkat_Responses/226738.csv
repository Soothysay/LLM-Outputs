   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), pulmonary embolism (PE) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, Coombs positive hemolytic anemia, and possible congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure, presumed to be due to CHF. However, a chest X-ray showed bilateral consolidations, which are concerning for pneumonia (PNA). Empiric antibiotics have been started.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, likely due to intubation and the use of fentanyl/versed. Infection may also be a contributing factor.

3. CAD s/p MI: The patient has a history of MI and is currently on aspirin, statin, beta-blocker (BB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi).

4. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, but the type and ejection fraction (EF) are unknown. Lasix, aldactone, ACEi, and BB should be held.

5. DM: The patient is on metformin at home"

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), pulmonary embolism (PE) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, Coombs positive hemolytic anemia, possible congestive heart failure (CHF) who was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure. 

24-hour events include blood cultures, sputum culture, arterial line placement, multi-lumen line placement, and discontinuation of PICC line. The patient's condition has worsened with decreasing PaO2 despite increasing FiO2, worsening chest X-ray, and decreasing urine output. 

Medications include Ceftazidime, Levofloxacin, Piperacillin, Vancomycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is also on pantoprazole, midazolam, and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure ranging from 152/67 to 157/71 mmHg, heart rate between 106-115 bpm, respiratory rate at 25-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary embolism, and coombs positive hemolytic anemia. The patient presented to Hospital1 with respiratory failure and was intubated. He had elevated BNP and CTA showing bilateral consolidations, leading to the suspicion of congestive heart failure and pneumonia. The patient was started on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. He is currently being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, and there is a concern for co-existing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient has worsening PaO2, increased FiO2, and thick blood-tinged secretions, which may indicate an infection. This could lead to sepsis, especially considering the patient's immunocompromised state due to prolonged steroid use for anemia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable to high, but there is a possibility of hypotension due to intubation and the use of fentanyl and versed.
4. Coronary Artery Disease post Myocardial Infarction: The patient has a history of CAD and previous MI.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), pulmonary embolism (PE) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, positive Coombs test indicating hemolytic anemia, and possible congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and was found to have bilateral consolidations on chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia (PNA). He is currently intubated and on assist control ventilation.

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, hypotension, CAD post-MI, CHF, diabetes mellitus (DM), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The plan includes sending sputum cultures, bronchoscopy, weaning off levophed as tolerated, and obtaining medical records from previous hospitals.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis due to possible source of infection, further deterioration in cardiac function, uncontrolled blood glucose levels, and development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a variety of medical issues. The patient's oxygen levels are decreasing, and they have been suctioned for thick blood-tinged secretions. The patient's urine output is also decreasing despite attempts to increase fluid intake. There is a falling hemoglobin level, indicating potential blood loss or decreased production. The patient's stool test is positive for blood, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding. Blood pressure is stable but high at times, responding to fentanyl. The patient has multiple allergies and is on several antibiotics due to suspected infection. 

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate between 106-108 beats per minute. Blood pressure is generally high, ranging from 152/67 to 157/71 mmHg. Respiratory rate is within normal limits at 25 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains at 100%. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,431 mL and output of 1,134 mL, indicating a positive balance of 4,297 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a tidal volume set at 340 mL, respiratory rate set at 25, PEEP at 8 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%, and other parameters within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient presented to the hospital intubated in respiratory failure, presumed to be due to congestive heart failure (CHF) and pneumonia (PNA). The patient has elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and computed tomography (CT) scan showing bilateral consolidations, which indicates acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient started on empirical antibiotics and ARDS ventilation.

The patient also has positive Coombs test indicating hemolytic anemia. The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a concern for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hematoma, hemolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has leukopenia with impending neutropenia, and the etiology is unclear. There is a concern for a myeloproliferative process or infection.

The patient has a history of CHF, but the type and ejection fraction (EF) are unknown. An echocardiogram (ECHO) has been ordered to assess the patient's cardiac function. The patient's diabetes mellitus (DM) is being managed with an insulin drip for glucose control.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) after myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), pulmonary embolism (PE) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, Coombs positive hemolytic anemia, possible congestive heart failure (CHF), and respiratory failure.
- She presented to the hospital intubated and in respiratory failure, presumed to be due to CHF and pneumonia (PNA) with elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and computed tomography (CTA) showing bilateral consolidations. There is also concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- She was started on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation.
- The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple complications including hypotension, CHF, CAD post-MI, diabetes mellitus (DM), PE, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hypertension.
- She requires ongoing supportive care including respiratory support, fluid management, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Further diagnostic tests and consultations are planned to investigate the etiology of her anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and possible bone marrow process.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with fluctuating vital signs, persistent hyperglycemia, and need for increasing ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for several days, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary to identify any signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and bed rest increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and low molecular weight heparin should be considered.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors should be continued to prevent gastritis.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of nosocomial infections. Regular monitoring of vital signs and daily review of cultures are essential.
5. Bone marrow process: The patient has a concern for a bone marrow process, which could be contributing to her pancytopenia. Further investigation with a bone marrow biopsy may be required if her condition improves."

   This is an 84 yof with hx of CAD s/p MI, HTN, Hyperlipdemia, PVD, PE
   s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia, possible
   CHF who was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for respiratory failure. Clinical
   status has continues to decline.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented to [**Hospital1 54**] intubated in
   respiratory failure presumed [**1-1**] CHF and PNA with elevated BNP and CTA
   showing bilateral consolidations with co-existing ARDS. Patient started
   on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p MI, HTN, hyperlipidemia, PVD, PE, and Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. He presented to the hospital intubated in respiratory failure presumed to be due to CHF and PNA. The patient has bilateral consolidations with co-existing ARDS. He is on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to decline, indicating the need for close monitoring of oxygenation and consideration of diuresis if there is worsening.
2. Anemia: The patient has a history of Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. It is most likely due to toxic metabolic state plus MDS. The plan is to continue Solumedrol daily, perform Fe studies, B12 Folate levels, and consider diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and retroperitoneal hematoma as differential diagnoses.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistent thrombocytopenia this admission, which is most likely due to MDS and toxic metabolic state. HIT seems inconsistent despite HIT history. Avoid all heparin products, hold ASA and NSAIDs, and consider changing antibiotics based on cultures when possible.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's leukopenia has somewhat recovered. The etiology is most likely MDS and toxic metabolic state"

   This is an 84 yof with hx of CAD s/p MI, HTN, Hyperlipdemia, PVD, PE
   s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia, possible
   CHF who was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for respiratory failure. Clinical
   status has continues to decline.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented to [**Hospital1 54**] intubated in
   respiratory failure presumed [**1-1**] CHF and PNA with elevated BNP and CTA
   showing bilateral consolidations with co-existing ARDS. Patient started
   on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. At this time sputum is
   positive for Pseudomonas, Asparagillus, and CMV. ID is consulting. Pt
   receiving pip/tazo, voriconazole. ID will consider gancyclovir.
   -          cont pip/tazo
   -          Give two doses of vori 300mg IVq12 then reduce to 200mg
   IVq12
   -          cont assist control ventilation per ARDS protocol
   -          monitor oxygen status, if worsens, consider diuresis
   -          Still considering PCP treatment given prolonged steroid use.
   If declines, add
   # Anemia: Hx of Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. On solumendrol 60mg
   IV daily. Most likely due to toxic metabolic state plus MDS. DD
   includes diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hematoma

   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced.
   # Leukopenia: Still low, but recovered somewhat. Etiology is most like
   MDS and toxic metabolic state, as above. [**Month (only) 60**] consider G-CSF
   -          Etiology unclear.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p MI, HTN, hyperlipidemia, PVD, PE, s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia, possible CHF, who presented to the hospital intubated in respiratory failure. The patient's clinical status has continued to decline. The patient has respiratory failure, presumed CHF and pneumonia, with sputum positive for Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, and CMV. The patient is receiving piperacillin/tazobactam, voriconazole, and assist-control ventilation per ARDS protocol. The patient also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and possible thrombophlebitis in the right upper limb. The patient has a history of CHF, CAD s/p MI, DM, HTN, and PE. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has respiratory failure due to presumed CHF and pneumonia. The sputum culture is positive for Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, and CMV. These infections may worsen the patient's condition and require appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistent thrombocytopenia, likely due to toxic metabolic state and possible MDS. This can increase the risk of bleeding and requires close monitoring.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p MI, HTN, hyperlipidemia, PVD, PE, and Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia. The patient was admitted to Hospital1 for respiratory failure and was transferred to Hospital2 due to declining clinical status. Upon arrival, the patient was intubated and diagnosed with presumed CHF and pneumonia (PNA) with bilateral consolidations and ARDS. The patient's sputum grew Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, and CMV, and he is receiving empiric antibiotics and antifungal treatment. The patient's condition continues to decline, and he has developed anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and possible thrombophlebitis. The patient's past medical history includes CHF, CAD s/p MI, HTN, DM, and PE with IVC filter placement. The patient's current medications include insulin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), voriconazole, and fentanyl/versed. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his respiratory status remains concerning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he has ARDS. Continued respiratory support may be required.
2. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient's sputum culture grew Pseudomonas, which is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary embolism, and positive Coombs test for hemolytic anemia. The patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and is intubated. The patient's clinical status has continued to decline. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including congestive heart failure, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and possible Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's current medications include piperacillin/tazobactam, voriconazole, and metformin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure, which has been complicated by ARDS. The patient is currently on assist control ventilation per ARDS protocol. Monitoring oxygen status and considering diuretics if necessary.
2. Pseudomonas Infection: Sputum culture positive for Pseudomonas. Antibiotics have been changed to cover this organism.
3. Aspergillus Infection: Sputum culture positive for Aspergillus. Antifungal medication (voriconazole) has been started.
4. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection: Sputum culture positive for CMV. Antiviral medication (g"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84 yof with hx of CAD s/p MI, HTN, Hyperlipdemia, PVD, PE
   s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia, possible
   CHF who was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for respiratory failure. Clinical
   status has continues to decline.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented to [**Hospital1 54**] intubated in
   respiratory failure presumed [**1-1**] CHF and PNA with elevated BNP and CTA
   showing bilateral consolidations with co-existing ARDS. Patient started
   on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. At this time sputum is
   positive for Pseudomonas, Asparagillus, and CMV. ID is consulting. Pt
   receiving pip/tazo, voriconazole. ID will consider gancyclovir.
   -          cont pip/tazo
   -          Give two doses of vori 300mg IVq12 then reduce to 200mg
   IVq12
   -          cont assist control ventilation per ARDS protocol
   -          monitor oxygen status, if worsens, consider diuresis
   -          Still considering PCP treatment given prolonged steroid use.
   If declines, add
   # Anemia: Hx of Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. On solumendrol 60mg
   IV daily. Most likely due to toxic metabolic state plus MDS. DD
   includes diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          Received 1U pRBC o/n
   -          cont Solumedrol daily
   -          Fe studies and B12 Folate NL.
   -          DIC labs NL
   -          Hemolysis labs NL
   -          H/O following
   -          piparacillin both may be complicating this. Will change
   based on cultures when possible. Considering meropenem.
   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced
   # Thrombocytopenia: persistent this admission. As with anemia, most
   likely due to MDS and toxic metabolic state. HIT seems inconsistent in
   spite of HIT history
   -          Avoid all heparin products
   -          Holding ASA and NSAIDs in general
   -          H/O following.
   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced.
   # Leukopenia: Still low, but recovered somewhat. Etiology is most like
   MDS and toxic metabolic state, as above. [**Month (only) 60**] consider G-CSF
   -          Etiology unclear.
   -          H/O following
   # CHF:  Patient with history of CHF, unknown type, EF 50%
   -          ECHO NL with mildly reduced EF
   -          Hold, Aldactone, ACEi, BB
   -          Lasix as needed depending on pulmonary status
   # CAD s/p MI:  Hx of MI.
   -          Hold ASA given thrombocytopenia
   -          Hold statin, BB, ACEi
   # DM: on metformin at home.
   -          hold metformin while in ICU
   -          Insulin drip for glucose control
   # Hypotension:  Most likely in setting of intubation and
   Fentanyl/Versed.  Now resolved.
   # PE: ?history of IVC filter placement, no filter on CT scan
   -          Pneumoboots for now, no Heparin given ?HIT
   # HTN: hold home BB, ACEi, Lasix, Aldactone, Diltiazem

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), pulmonary embolism (PE) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, Coombs positive hemolytic anemia, possible congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented to the hospital intubated in respiratory failure, presumed to be due to CHF and pneumonia (PNA) with elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and computed tomography (CT) scan showing bilateral consolidations with co-existing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient started on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. Subsequently, sputum culture grew pseudomonas, aspergillus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), prompting the addition of voriconazole and consideration of gancyclovir. The patient also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, CHF, CAD post-MI, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypotension, PE, and HTN. The patient's clinical status has continued to decline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's sputum culture grew pseudomonas, aspergillus, and CMV, indicating a possible ongoing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He has been experiencing fevers, hypotension, and hypoxia. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics but still has positive cultures for Pseudomonas and Aspergillus. He has been started on antifungal therapy with Voriconazole and will undergo further evaluation for CMV infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains on mechanical ventilation. His laboratory values show leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which may be due to sepsis or bone marrow suppression. The patient's blood cultures have grown Pseudomonas and Aspergillus, and he is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. His condition is being closely monitored, and further interventions will be based on the results of ongoing evaluations. Potential medical complications include ongoing infection, septic shock, multi-drug resistant organism infection, and complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84 yof with hx of CAD s/p MI, HTN, Hyperlipdemia, PVD, PE
   s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia, possible
   CHF who was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for respiratory failure. Clinical
   status has continues to decline.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented to [**Hospital1 54**] intubated in
   respiratory failure presumed [**1-1**] CHF and PNA with elevated BNP and CTA
   showing bilateral consolidations with co-existing ARDS. Patient started
   on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. At this time sputum is
   positive for Pseudomonas, Asparagillus, and CMV. ID is consulting. Pt
   receiving pip/tazo, voriconazole. ID will consider gancyclovir.
   -          cont pip/tazo
   -          Give two doses of vori 300mg IVq12 then reduce to 200mg
   IVq12
   -          cont assist control ventilation per ARDS protocol
   -          monitor oxygen status, if worsens, consider diuresis
   -          Still considering PCP treatment given prolonged steroid use.
   If declines, add
   # Anemia: Hx of Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. On solumendrol 60mg
   IV daily. Most likely due to toxic metabolic state plus MDS. DD
   includes diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          Received 1U pRBC o/n
   -          cont Solumedrol daily
   -          Fe studies and B12 Folate NL.
   -          DIC labs NL
   -          Hemolysis labs NL
   -          H/O following
   -          piparacillin both may be complicating this. Will change
   based on cultures when possible. Considering meropenem.
   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced
   # Thrombocytopenia: persistent this admission. As with anemia, most
   likely due to MDS and toxic metabolic state. HIT seems inconsistent in
   spite of HIT history
   -          Avoid all heparin products
   -          Holding ASA and NSAIDs in general
   -          H/O following.
   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced.
   # Leukopenia: Still low, but recovered somewhat. Etiology is most like
   MDS and toxic metabolic state, as above. [**Month (only) 60**] consider G-CSF
   -          Etiology unclear.
   -          H/O following
   # CHF:  Patient with history of CHF, unknown type, EF 50%
   -          ECHO NL with mildly reduced EF
   -          Hold, Aldactone, ACEi, BB
   -          Lasix as needed depending on pulmonary status
   # CAD s/p MI:  Hx of MI.
   -          Hold ASA given thrombocytopenia
   -          Hold statin, BB, ACEi
   # DM: on metformin at home.
   -          hold metformin while in ICU
   -          Insulin drip for glucose control
   # Hypotension:  Most likely in setting of intubation and
   Fentanyl/Versed.  Now resolved.
   # PE: ?history of IVC filter placement, no filter on CT scan
   -          Pneumoboots for now, no Heparin given ?HIT
   # HTN: hold home BB, ACEi, Lasix, Aldactone, Diltiazem

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p MI, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, PVD, PE, s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia, possible CHF, who was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on ARDS ventilation. Sputum is positive for Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, and CMV. The patient is receiving piperacillin/tazobactam, voriconazole, and fentanyl/versed. The patient's clinical status has continued to decline.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure presumed due to CHF and pneumonia. He is already on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. The presence of Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, and CMV in the sputum suggests a high risk of ongoing infection.
2. Anemia: The patient has a history of Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. He is currently receiving solu-Medrol 60mg IV daily. The anemia is likely due to a toxic metabolic state and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistent thrombocytopenia this admission. It is most likely due to MDS and toxic metabolic state. HIT seems inconsistent despite HIT history.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonas infection and aspergillus infection, for which they are being treated with antibiotics and antifungal medication. The patient's immune system is compromised, leading to concerns about sepsis.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (100 bpm) and blood pressure (102/35 mmHg). Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode, set at a tidal volume of 340 mL and respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. Oxygen delivery is maintained at 50% FiO2, ensuring a SpO2 of 96%.

Fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a total fluid intake of 4,550 mL and output of 1,201 mL via TF, 2,838 mL IVF, 375 mL blood products, and 446 mL urine. The NG drain is producing 346 mL of fluid.

Laboratory results indicate low white blood cell count (WBC 3.0), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct 29.4), and normal platelet count (Plt 48). Blood glucose levels are elevated (Glucose 248). Other lab values show normal to slightly abnormal results, with some elevated markers such as CK, Troponin-T, LDH, and CRP.

   Imaging:
   CXR [**7-17**] shows increased airspace opacity in right lung per my read.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84 yof with hx of CAD s/p MI, HTN, Hyperlipdemia, PVD, PE
   s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia, possible
   CHF who was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for respiratory failure. Clinical
   status has continued to decline. At this time she is intubated with
   PNA  with known Pseudamonas and CMV, as well as reported Aspirgillus.
   She also has a  R axillary DVT, and anasarca.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented to [**Hospital1 54**] intubated in
   respiratory failure presumed [**1-1**] CHF and PNA with elevated BNP and CTA
   showing bilateral consolidations with co-existing ARDS. Patient started
   on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. At this time sputum is
   positive for Pseudomonas, Aspirgillus, and CMV. ID is consulting. Pt
   receiving pip/tazo, voriconazole. ID will consider gancyclovir.
   -          the Aspirgillus was per phone report, will f/u with
   cytology/micro on Monday, continue voriconazole in interim
   -          cont pip/tazo
   -          Now on vori 200mg IVq12
   -          cont assist control ventilation per ARDS protocol
   -          monitor oxygen status, if worsens, consider diuresis. As of
   now ABG improving
   -          Had been considering PCP treatment given prolonged steroid
   use, however, unlikely at this point given known bacterial infection.
   # RUE Axillary DVT: Red and erythematous at site of old PICC
   -          US yesterday showed an occlussive thrombus of the R axillary
   vein
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] be a chronic problem given report of discoloration from
   family
   -          Consider anticoagulation with argatroban given concern for
   HIT, though will hold off for now, as axillary clots typically stable
   and pt at risk of bleeding from multiple other sources.
   -          Try changing positioning to reduce edema
   -          Re-site A-line to left arm and subsequently d/c R a-line
   # Anemia: Hx of Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. On solumendrol 60mg
   IV daily. Most likely due to toxic metabolic state plus MDS. DD
   includes diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          Received 1U pRBC yesterday. HCT/Hb 28.3, down from 31.3 on
   [**7-16**].
   -          transfuse 1 Unit PRBCs [**7-17**], f/u psot-transfusion Hct
   -          cont Solumedrol daily at home dose, not stress dose
   -          Fe studies and B12 Folate NL.
   -          DIC labs NL
   -          Hemolysis labs NL
   -          H/O following
   -          piparacillin both may be complicating this. Considering
   meropenem given sensitivity of her Pseudomonas, will hold off for now
   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced
   # Thrombocytopenia: persistent this admission. As with anemia, most
   likely due to MDS and toxic metabolic state. HIT seems inconsistent in
   spite of HIT history
   -          Avoid all heparin products
   -          Holding ASA and NSAIDs in general
   -          H/O following.
   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced.
   # Leukopenia: Still low, but recovered somewhat. Etiology is most like
   MDS and toxic metabolic state, as above. [**Month (only) 60**] consider G-CSF
   -          Etiology unclear.
   -          H/O following
   # CHF:  Patient with history of CHF, unknown type, EF 50%
   -          ECHO NL with mildly reduced EF
   -          Hold, Aldactone, ACEi, BB
   -          Lasix as needed depending on pulmonary status
   # CAD s/p MI:  Hx of MI.
   -          Hold ASA given thrombocytopenia
   -          Hold statin, BB, ACEi
   # DM: on metformin at home.
   -          hold metformin while in ICU
   -          Insulin drip for glucose control
   # Hypotension:  Most likely in setting of intubation and
   Fentanyl/Versed.
   - continues to be hypotensive with position changes
   - receiving 1 unit PRBCs
   # PE: ?history of IVC filter placement, no filter on CT scan
   -          Pneumoboots for now, no Heparin given ?HIT
   # HTN: hold home BB, ACEi, Lasix, Aldactone, Diltiazem

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), pulmonary embolism (PE) post-inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, Coombs positive hemolytic anemia, and possible congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure. Clinical status has continued to decline. She is intubated with pneumonia positive for Aspergillus and Pseudomonas as well as cytomegalovirus (CMV). She also has an occlusive right axillary vein thrombus and anasarca.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure presumed secondary to CHF and pneumonia with elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and computed tomography (CT) scan showing bilateral consolidations with co-existing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. Sputum is positive for Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, and CMV. Infectious disease (ID) consultation is pending. The patient will continue on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and voriconazole. ID will consider gancyclovir.

   This is an 84 yof with hx of CAD s/p MI, HTN, Hyperlipdemia, PVD, PE
   s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia, possible
   CHF who was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for respiratory failure. Clinical

   PNA  with known Pseudamonas and CMV, as well as reported Aspirgillus.
   She also has a  R axillary DVT, and anasarca.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented to [**Hospital1 54**] intubated in
   respiratory failure presumed [**1-1**] CHF and PNA with elevated BNP and CTA

   -          Consider anticoagulation with argatroban given concern for
   HIT, though will hold off for now, as axillary clots typically stable
   and pt at risk of bleeding from multiple other sources.
   -          Try changing positioning to reduce edema
   -          Re-site A-line to left arm and subsequently d/c R a-line
   # Anemia: Hx of Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. On solumendrol 60mg

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary embolism, positive Coombs test for hemolytic anemia, and possible congestive heart failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has since developed pneumonia with known Pseudomonas and CMV infections. The patient also has a right axillary deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anasarca, and various laboratory abnormalities including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The patient's condition continues to decline, and the medical team is managing multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure presumed to be due to congestive heart failure (CHF) and pneumonia. She is currently intubated and receiving assist-control ventilation per ARDS protocol.
2. Pseudomonas and CMV Infections: The patient has sputum positive for Pseudomonas and CMV. She is receiving appropriate antibiotics and antiviral therapy.
3. Right Axillary DVT: The patient has an occlusive thrombus in the right axillary vein. Anticoagulation therapy is being considered due to the risk of pulmonary embolism.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia. Her anemia is most likely due"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of allergies to hydrochlorothiazide, unknown allergies, and a medical history of hypertension. The patient's chief complaint is a fever of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 128/48 mmHg to 180/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 340 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 90%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 69, and respiratory rate (RR) of 10.4 L/min. 

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 72 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hb) of 13.7 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 194 mg/dL, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 44 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers, are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed due to being in the ICU. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.34, indicating respiratory acidosis. The patient's respiratory support is provided through mechanical ventilation, and the ventilator settings are appropriate for assisted spontaneous breathing.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient's fever and elevated WBC count could be indicative of an infection.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, there is a risk of developing a nosocomial bloodstream infection, especially with the use of central venous catheters.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output indicate the possibility of AKI. The use of nephrotoxic medications and decreased renal perfusion due to hypotension could contribute to the development of AKI.
4. Delirium: Prolonged ICU stay, sedative medications, and the patient's underlying medical conditions increase the risk of delirium.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT."

   is associated with the pre-existing cavitary lesion in the RLL.
   -          cont assist control ventilation per ARDS protocol
   -------PTX: Likely the cause of her increased FiO2 requirements as well
   as the pressor requirements. CT surgery was consulted and placed a
   chest tube. Patient
s follow-up CXR showed better aeration throughout
   both lungs. We will follow her O2 requirements and try to wean down the
   FiO2 today now that both lungs are aerating. Will also wean off
   pressors if able.
   ---------PNA: PSA in sputum. Aspirgillus and CMV in BAL sample was per
   phone report, will f/u with cytology/micro, continue voriconazole in
   interim and  cont pip/tazo as sensitive to this antibiotic. Was some
   concern about BM depression with Pip-Tazo but now counts of all cell
   lines recovering so will not switch ABx unless recommended by ID.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary embolism, and positive Coombs test indicating hemolytic anemia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus species, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). The patient also has a right axillary deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anasarca (generalized swelling), and a pleural effusion in the right lower lobe (RLL). She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure presumed to be secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) and pneumonia. She has been on antibiotics and ARDS ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a positive sputum culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus species, and CMV. She is receiving appropriate antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Voriconazole.
3. Right-Sided Pneumothorax (PTX): The patient developed a right-sided PTX while on mechanical ventilation. It was associated with increased FiO2 requirements and pressor requirements. A"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old individual with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and pulmonary embolism (PE) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. The patient also has a subclavian line with prior complications, Coombs positive anemia on chronic steroids, and chronic steroid use.

The patient was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure and pneumonia (PNA). They were transferred to the ICU due to spiking temperatures, right lower lobe (RLL) cavitary lesion, and positive cultures for Aspergillus and Pseudomonas as well as cytomegalovirus (CMV). The patient experienced a pneumothorax yesterday and has been on mechanical ventilation with invasive modes.

The patient's 24-hour events include fever, restart of antibiotics, and the placement of an arterial line. The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate (HR) of 120 beats per minute (bpm) with an elevated respiratory rate (RR) of 20 inspiratory breaths per minute. Blood pressure (BP) is within normal range. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) is at 95%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg, and the total fluid intake is 2,381 mL with a total fluid output of 652 mL.

   24 Hour Events:
 CHEST TUBE PLACED - At [**2185-7-18**] 09:30 AM
   R. sided [**3-5**] intercostal space chest tube for pneumothorax, to
   waterseal, no suction at this time
   #. PTX on CXR yesterday. CT placed CT. Patient was initially better
   with BPs increased and HRs down. Then BPs started to trend down with
   Increasing HR. Patient received 2X 500Ns bolus and then was started on
   1L D5Ns at 75ml/hour to maintain pressures. Ultimately another CXR was
   obtained that showed no resolution of the PTX and the chest tube seemed
   to have fallen out slightly. When it was replaced the patient began to
   do better clinically with decreased HRs and increased BPs. Developed
   mucous plug at around 2am. SBPs dropped to 60s and Hr up to 150s with
   sats ~88% on 100% FiO2. ABG:7.31/38/47. Suctioned out large sputum plug
   and sats came up, BPs came up, and HRs went down to high 90s.
   #. She also converted into Afib with RVR (rate around 150). An EKG was
   done confirming this and showing ST depressions in V2. She was given
   5mg lopressor then 20mg IV diltiazem and rates came down into the 100s
   with BP 100/50.  All of her electrolytes were WNL at the time. She then
   developed HRs in the 150s. Given another 5mg lopressor which dropped
   her BPs to the 80s/40s and did not change her HR. Hct was down to 32
   from 42 in the am and lactate was elevated at 3.2 with  MvO2 of 77%.
   UOP was around 15-30mL/hr. Decided to give her 1unit pRBCs to try to
   increased O2 delivery.
   #. ID has been following and recommended meropenem instead of zosyn to
   treat pseudomonas in sputum as MIC was high for zosyn and lower for
   meropenem. the antibiotics were thus switched.
   #. Heme/onc suggested weaning steroids very slowly (Qweek) to ensure no
   AI. Will likely start weaning today.

   Sputum: PSA sensitive to meropenem in sputum
   BCx: NGTD
   CXR: Stable multilobular patchy infiltrates. PTX resolving with CT in
   place.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84 yof with hx of CAD s/p MI, HTN, Hyperlipdemia, PVD, PE
   s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia, possible
   CHF who was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for respiratory failure. Clinical
   status has continued to decline. At this time she is intubated with
   PNA  with known Pseudamonas and CMV, as well as reported Aspirgillus.
   She also has a  R axillary DVT, and anasarca.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented to [**Hospital1 54**] intubated in
   respiratory failure presumed [**1-1**] CHF and PNA with elevated BNP and CTA
   showing bilateral consolidations with co-existing ARDS. Patient started
   on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. At this time sputum is
   positive for Pseudomonas, Aspirgillus, and CMV. ID is consulting. Pt
   receiving pip/tazo, voriconazole. ID will consider gancyclovir. Pt
   developed right-sided PTX today while on the ventilator
 looks like it
   is associated with the pre-existing cavitary lesion in the RLL.
   -          cont assist control ventilation per ARDS protocol. Still
   requiring very high FiO2 with PEEP at 12. Likely has shunt physiology
   still as CXR shows diffuse pulm edema/ARDS. Will attempt to wean down
   FiO2 now that PTX resolving and mucous plug removed.
   -------PTX: Likely the cause of her increased FiO2 requirements as well
   as the pressor requirements. CT surgery was consulted and placed a
   chest tube. Patient
s follow-up CXR showed better aeration throughout
   both lungs. We will follow her O2 requirements and try to wean down the
   FiO2 today now that both lungs are aerating. Will also wean off
   pressors if able.
   ---------PNA: PSA in sputum. Aspirgillus and CMV in BAL sample was per
   phone report, will f/u with cytology/micro, continue voriconazole in
   interim and  cont pip/tazo as sensitive to this antibiotic. Was some
   concern about BM depression with Pip-Tazo but now counts of all cell
   lines recovering so will not switch ABx unless recommended by ID. Will
   culture fluid from chest tube.
   # Shock: With decreaed UOP and increased lactate in setting of ARDS [**1-1**]
   PNA. Most likely septic not cardiogenic as MVO2 77%.  Hypotension
   better with lower HR and removal of mucous plug. Also received multiple
   boluses of fluids and 1unit of blood. CVP still only 8.
   - continues to be hypotensive with position changes
   - Received several fluid boluses and 1unit pRBCs yesterday with only
   minimal effect on MAPs or CVP.
   -will continue to follow the lactate and MvO2 to assess perfusion.
   -Will bolus with NS today to attempt to increase her CVP and therefore
   her CO. Eventually she may require pressors.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider amio if has afib with RVR that decreases her MAPs and
   CO.
   # Pan-cytopenia:
   Yesterday seemed to be resolving but may have been intravascularly
   contracted leading to falsely elevated counts as subsequent
   measurements showed a decrease of all counts back to where she had been
   previously.
   For the Anemia: Hx of Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. On solumendrol
   60mg IV daily. Most likely due to toxic metabolic state plus MDS. DD
   includes diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          Received 1U pRBC [**2185-7-17**]. Hct now in 40s although may be
   intravascularly depleted.
   -          transfuse 1 Unit PRBCs [**7-17**], f/u psot-transfusion Hct
   -          cont Solumedrol daily at home dose,  and will wean off as
   able over next few days.
   -          Fe studies and B12 Folate NL.
   -          DIC labs NL
   -          Hemolysis labs NL
   -          H/O following: No BM biopsy now as too unstable.
   For the Thrombocytopenia: persistent this admission. As with anemia,
   most likely due to MDS and toxic metabolic state. HIT seems
   inconsistent in spite of HIT history
   -          Avoid all heparin products
   -          Holding ASA and NSAIDs in general
   -          H/O following.
   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced.
   For the Leukopenia: Still low, but recovered somewhat. Etiology is most
   like MDS and toxic metabolic state, as above. [**Month (only) 60**] consider G-CSF
   -          Etiology unclear.
   -          H/O following
   # RUE Axillary DVT: Red and erythematous at site of old PICC
   -          US yesterday showed an occlussive thrombus of the R axillary
   vein
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] be a chronic problem given report of discoloration from
   family
   -          Consider anticoagulation with argatroban given concern for
   HIT, though will hold off for now, as axillary clots typically stable
   and pt at risk of bleeding from multiple other sources.
   -          Try changing positioning to reduce edema
   # CHF:  Patient with history of CHF, unknown type, EF 50%
   -          ECHO NL with mildly reduced EF
   -          Hold, Aldactone, ACEi, BB
   # CAD s/p MI:  Hx of MI.
   -          Hold ASA given thrombocytopenia
   -          Hold statin, BB, ACEi
   # DM: on metformin at home.
   -          hold metformin while in ICU
   -          Insulin drip for glucose control while on D5 in her fluids
   # PE: history of IVC filter placement per old records
   - no pneumoboots as developed severe ecchymoses in setting of
   pan-cytopenia. No heparin as ?HIT antibody previously
   # HTN: hold home BB, ACEi, Lasix, Aldactone, Diltiazem

   patient
s respiratory status is at best stable with ARDS requiring very
   high FiO2 and her MAPS and HR have been difficult to control as well so
   that she may require pressors.
","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, and pulmonary embolism. She also has a positive Coombs test indicating hemolytic anemia and possible chronic heart failure. The patient presented to the hospital intubated for respiratory failure presumed to be due to acute exacerbation of CHF and pneumonia. She has been on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. Sputum is positive for Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, and CMV. The patient developed a right-sided pneumothorax while on mechanical ventilation, which is associated with a pre-existing cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe. She underwent chest tube placement and subsequent follow-up chest X-ray showed better aeration throughout both lungs. The patient's respiratory status remains stable with ARDS requiring very high FiO2. She also has septic shock with decreased urine output and increased lactate, likely secondary to pneumonia. The patient's condition has continued to decline, and she has been weaned off some pressors. She has received multiple fluid boluses and 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Her CVP remains low at 8 mmHg. The patient also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, most likely due to myelodysplastic syndrome and toxic metabolic state. Other medical"

   24 Hour Events:
 CHEST TUBE PLACED - At [**2185-7-18**] 09:30 AM
   R. sided [**3-5**] intercostal space chest tube for pneumothorax, to
   waterseal, no suction at this time
   #. PTX on CXR yesterday. CT placed CT. Patient was initially better
   with BPs increased and HRs down. Then BPs started to trend down with
   Increasing HR. Patient received 2X 500Ns bolus and then was started on
   1L D5Ns at 75ml/hour to maintain pressures. Ultimately another CXR was
   obtained that showed no resolution of the PTX and the chest tube seemed
   to have fallen out slightly. When it was replaced the patient began to
   do better clinically with decreased HRs and increased BPs. Developed
   mucous plug at around 2am. SBPs dropped to 60s and Hr up to 150s with
   sats ~88% on 100% FiO2. ABG:7.31/38/47. Suctioned out large sputum plug
   and sats came up, BPs came up, and HRs went down to high 90s.
   #. She also converted into Afib with RVR (rate around 150). An EKG was
   done confirming this and showing ST depressions in V2. She was given
   5mg lopressor then 20mg IV diltiazem and rates came down into the 100s
   with BP 100/50.  All of her electrolytes were WNL at the time. She then
   developed HRs in the 150s. Given another 5mg lopressor which dropped
   her BPs to the 80s/40s and did not change her HR. Hct was down to 32
   from 42 in the am and lactate was elevated at 3.2 with  MvO2 of 77%.
   UOP was around 15-30mL/hr. Decided to give her 1unit pRBCs to try to
   increased O2 delivery.
   #. ID has been following and recommended meropenem instead of zosyn to
   treat pseudomonas in sputum as MIC was high for zosyn and lower for
   meropenem. the antibiotics were thus switched.
   #. Heme/onc suggested weaning steroids very slowly (Qweek) to ensure no
   AI. Will likely start weaning today.

   ---------PNA: PSA in sputum. Aspirgillus and CMV in BAL sample was per
   phone report, will f/u with cytology/micro, continue voriconazole in
   interim and  cont pip/tazo as sensitive to this antibiotic. Was some
   concern about BM depression with Pip-Tazo but now counts of all cell
   lines recovering so will not switch ABx unless recommended by ID.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary embolism, positive Coombs hemolytic anemia, and possible congestive heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is currently intubated due to pneumonia with known Pseudomonas and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, as well as reported Aspergillus infection. The patient also has a right axillary deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and anasarca (generalized swelling). 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with respiratory failure presumed to be secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) and pneumonia (PNA). She is on ARDS ventilation and has sputum positive for Pseudomonas, Aspergillus, and CMV. The ID doctor is consulting and the patient is receiving piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and voriconazole. The chest X-ray showed right-sided pneumothorax (PTX), which was likely caused by the ventilator and associated with a pre-existing cavitary lesion in the right lower lobe (RLL). The CT surgery team placed a chest tube, and the follow-up chest X-ray showed better aeration in both lungs. The plan is to wean down the FiO2"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of pneumonia and sepsis. He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. On admission, he was in respiratory distress and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Initial laboratory results showed signs of infection and organ dysfunction, including elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate levels.

Over the course of the next few days, the patient's condition improved with appropriate antibiotic therapy, supportive care, and hemodynamic stabilization. However, on day 4, he developed a pneumothorax, which required the placement of a chest tube. The procedure was initially successful, but the patient experienced complications such as hypotension, tachycardia, and desaturation. Another chest tube placement was performed, and the patient's vital signs stabilized.

During this time, the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was treated with medications. He had an episode of mucous plug formation in the endotracheal tube, which was suctioned out. His blood pressure remained unstable, requiring multiple boluses of fluids and vasopressors.

The patient's laboratory results continued to show signs of infection and organ dysfunction. His blood glucose levels were elevated, indicating possible stress response or steroid use. His kidney function was mildly impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels.

Radiology images showed no resolution of the pneumothorax, and the"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 84 yof with hx of CAD s/p MI, HTN, Hyperlipdemia, PVD, PE
   s/p IVC filter placement, Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia, possible
   CHF who was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] for respiratory failure. Clinical
   status has continued to decline. At this time she is intubated with
   PNA  with known Pseudamonas and CMV, as well as reported Aspirgillus.
   She also has a  R axillary DVT, and anasarca.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Patient presented to [**Hospital1 54**] intubated in
   respiratory failure presumed [**1-1**] CHF and PNA with elevated BNP and CTA
   showing bilateral consolidations with co-existing ARDS. Patient started
   on empiric antibiotics and ARDS ventilation. At this time sputum is
   positive for Pseudomonas, Aspirgillus, and CMV. ID is consulting. Pt
   receiving pip/tazo, voriconazole. ID will consider gancyclovir. Pt
   developed right-sided PTX today while on the ventilator
 looks like it
   is associated with the pre-existing cavitary lesion in the RLL.
   -          cont assist control ventilation per ARDS protocol. Still
   requiring very high FiO2 with PEEP at 12. Likely has shunt physiology
   still as CXR shows diffuse pulm edema/ARDS. Will attempt to wean down
   FiO2 now that PTX resolving and mucous plug removed.
   -------PTX: Likely the cause of her increased FiO2 requirements as well
   as the pressor requirements. CT surgery was consulted and placed a
   chest tube. Patient
s follow-up CXR showed better aeration throughout
   both lungs. We will follow her O2 requirements and try to wean down the
   FiO2 today now that both lungs are aerating. Will also wean off
   pressors if able.
   ---------PNA: PSA in sputum. Aspirgillus and CMV in BAL sample was per
   phone report, will f/u with cytology/micro, continue voriconazole in
   interim and  cont pip/tazo as sensitive to this antibiotic. Was some
   concern about BM depression with Pip-Tazo but now counts of all cell
   lines recovering so will not switch ABx unless recommended by ID.
   # Shock: With decreaed UOP and increased lactate in setting of ARDS [**1-1**]
   PNA. Most likely septic not cardiogenic as MVO2 77%.  Hypotension
   better with lower HR and removal of mucous plug.
   - continues to be hypotensive with position changes
   - Received several fluid boluses and 1unit pRBCs yesterday with only
   minimal effect on MAPs.
   -[**Month (only) 60**] require pressors and/or rhythm control with amio to increase
   cardiac output so that she perfuses better.
   -will continue to follow the lactate and MvO2 to assess perfusion.
   # Anemia: Hx of Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. On solumendrol 60mg
   IV daily. Most likely due to toxic metabolic state plus MDS. DD
   includes diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, retroperitoneal hematoma
   -          Received 1U pRBC [**2185-7-17**]. Hct now in 40s although may be
   intravascularly depleted.
   -          transfuse 1 Unit PRBCs [**7-17**], f/u psot-transfusion Hct
   -          cont Solumedrol daily at home dose,  and will wean off as
   able over next few days.
   -          Fe studies and B12 Folate NL.
   -          DIC labs NL
   -          Hemolysis labs NL
   -          H/O following
   -          piparacillin both may be complicating this. Considering
   meropenem given sensitivity of her Pseudomonas, will hold off for now
   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced
   # Thrombocytopenia: persistent this admission. As with anemia, most
   likely due to MDS and toxic metabolic state. HIT seems inconsistent in
   spite of HIT history
   -          Avoid all heparin products
   -          Holding ASA and NSAIDs in general
   -          H/O following.
   -          Vancomycin may have been complicating this. Now D/Ced.
   # Leukopenia: Still low, but recovered somewhat. Etiology is most like
   MDS and toxic metabolic state, as above. [**Month (only) 60**] consider G-CSF
   -          Etiology unclear.
   -          H/O following
   # RUE Axillary DVT: Red and erythematous at site of old PICC
   -          US yesterday showed an occlussive thrombus of the R axillary
   vein
   -          [**Month (only) 60**] be a chronic problem given report of discoloration from
   family
   -          Consider anticoagulation with argatroban given concern for
   HIT, though will hold off for now, as axillary clots typically stable
   and pt at risk of bleeding from multiple other sources.
   -          Try changing positioning to reduce edema
   # CHF:  Patient with history of CHF, unknown type, EF 50%
   -          ECHO NL with mildly reduced EF
   -          Hold, Aldactone, ACEi, BB
   -          Lasix as needed depending on pulmonary status
   # CAD s/p MI:  Hx of MI.
   -          Hold ASA given thrombocytopenia
   -          Hold statin, BB, ACEi
   # DM: on metformin at home.
   -          hold metformin while in ICU
   -          Insulin drip for glucose control
   # PE: ?history of IVC filter placement, no filter on CT scan
   - no pneumoboots as developed severe ecchymoses in setting of
   pan-cytopenia
   # HTN: hold home BB, ACEi, Lasix, Aldactone, Diltiazem

","The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary embolism, and Coombs positive hemolytic anemia. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure, presumed congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia (PNA) with known Pseudomonas and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The patient also has a right axillary deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and anasarca.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, shock, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, right-sided pleural effusion (PTX), and possible CHF. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with ARDS protocol. She has been treated with antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and voriconazole, and is currently on meropenem.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressures, heart rates in the 150s, and oxygen saturation around 88% on 100% FiO2. Her hemoglobin level is low, platelet count is decreased, and white blood cell count is also low but recovering. Lactate levels are elevated, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of right lower lobe pneumonia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, respiratory failure, and pneumothorax. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP mode. The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and desaturation. She has been experiencing episodes of hypoxia and hypotension, requiring interventions such as suctioning a mucous plug and administering IV fluids. The patient is also hypothermic with a core temperature of 35.7°C.

The patient has a history of difficult-to-control atrial fibrillation and is currently on meropenem and voriconazole for suspected Aspergillus infection. Her blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She has been receiving chest physiotherapy and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging shows stable multilobar infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's primary issues include respiratory failure due to multilobar pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock with poor urine output, acute renal failure, and pancytopenia suspected to be due to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The prognosis is very poor, and a family"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  Multilobar PNA, ARDS.  PSA and aspergillus.
   Little improvement.   Continue meropenem and voriconazole.
   Shock:  Poor urine output.  CVP is low, will try to give IVF boluses to
   improve.
   Acute renal failure:  Due to shock.
   Pancytopenia:   Likely has MDS.
   AIHA:  taper steroids slowly.
   Can restart TFs
   Very poor prognosis will try to arrange family meeting today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), respiratory failure, and pneumothorax (PTX).
- She has been admitted to the ICU and received chest tube placement for the PTX.
- Overnight, she experienced desaturation, hypotension, tachycardia, and responded to suctioning of a mucous plug.
- The patient also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and increasing lactate levels, but then reverted back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with stabilized blood pressure.
- Antibiotics were initiated, including meropenem and voriconazole.
- Vital signs show fever, hypotension, and an increased heart rate.
- Respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 340 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 90%, and a plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O.
- Blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.28, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 73, and respiratory rate (Ve) of 10.3 L/min.
- Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the"
