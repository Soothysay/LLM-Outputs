   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   68M worsening symptoms of depression, found this morning unresponsive
   with suicide note. Brought to ER by EMS, NG tube placed and coffee
   ground found which cleared. Empty bottles at house were paxil and
   seroquel.
   Tox screen also positive for methadone and ASA. Intiubated in the ER
   becasue of poor mental status. Hct stable so EGD deferred. Transferred
   to ICU and given 1 unit PRBCs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 68-year-old male with worsening symptoms of depression found unresponsive with a suicide note. He was brought to the ER, where coffee grounds were found in his stomach and an NG tube was placed. Tox screen positive for methadone and ASA. Intubated in the ER due to poor mental status.
- Transferred to the ICU and given 1 unit PRBCs.
- On mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
- Stable hemodynamic status with a blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg.
- O2 saturation of 98% on ventilator.
- Flowsheet data shows normal vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support.
- ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and HCO3- of 28.5 mEq/L.
- Chest X-ray reveals right perihilar infiltrates, but ETT is okay.
- Head CT is negative for any significant findings.
- ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities.
- Assessment and plan include continuing supportive care, monitoring for signs of serotonin syndrome, and following up on ASA level and labs.
- Possible aspiration pneumonia is suspected, and a repeat CXR is planned in the morning.
- UGIB is suspected due to gastritis, and PPI therapy will be continued with a possible EGD in the morning.
- Renal insufficiency is unknown, so IVF will be continued and renal function will be monitored.
- Nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis measures are being implemented in the ICU.
- The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The right perihilar infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggest possible aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and considering a repeat CXR in the morning.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The presence of coffee grounds in the stomach indicates possible UGIB. Continuing PPI therapy and planning for an EGD in the morning to evaluate the source of bleeding.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline renal function is unknown, so it is important to monitor renal function closely and continue IVF.
4. Serotonin syndrome: The positive tox screen for methadone and ASA raises the concern for serotonin syndrome. Monitoring for signs such as agitation, tremor, hyperreflexia, and diarrhea.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and following infection control measures is essential.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient may be at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and intubation. Prophylactic measures such as stress ulcer prophylaxis should be continued.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylaxis with boots and subcutaneous UF heparin is being implemented."

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with worsening symptoms of depression who was found unresponsive with a suicide note. He has been brought to the emergency room and intubated due to poor mental status. The patient's tox screen is positive for methadone and ASA, and he has coffee grounds in his stomach contents. He has been given 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and placed on pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.4°C, heart rate 91 bpm, blood pressure 110/65 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on endotracheal tube ventilation. The patient is currently unresponsive with clear breath sounds and no evidence of edema in the lower extremities. 

The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 13.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.5%, and lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 168 mmHg. The chest X-ray reveals right perihilar infiltrates, but the endotracheal tube (ETT) is okay. The preliminary head CT is negative."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with worsening symptoms of depression and was found unresponsive with a suicide note. He was brought to the ER, where he was intubated due to poor mental status and a positive toxicology screen for methadone and ASA. An NG tube was placed, and coffee grounds were found, which cleared with lavage. Empty bottles of paxil and seroquel were found at his house. He received 1 unit of PRBCs and was transferred to the ICU. 

Current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal ventilation. His review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for worsening depression. 

The patient's flow sheet shows fluid balance, respiratory support, and other vital signs. His ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and HCO3- of 28.5 mEq/L. Imaging shows right perihilar infiltrates on chest X-ray and an ETT that is okay. A head CT was negative. His ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with regular intervals. 

Assessment and plan include ongoing supportive care, monitoring for signs of serotonin syndrome, continued vent support with hopes for extubation in the morning"

   # AMS. s/p multiple substance ingestion and likely the cause of
   patient's sedation/AMS. Other less likely etiologies include infectious
   (meningitis unlikely given no fever, acute onset, no prodrome),
   vascular (unlikely given negative CT findings), neuro (seizure unlikely
   cause of patient's sedation).  Concern in the setting of ingestion for
   prolonged QRS.  Also potential for serotonin syndrome although no

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male who was found unresponsive with empty pill bottles and a suicide note. He was admitted to the ICU for multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), renal failure, and depression.

The patient's respiratory failure is due to sedation and an inability to protect his airway, leading to intubation. The plan is to wean the ventilator as tolerated and consider extubation in the morning.

Regarding the gastrointestinal bleeding, there are concerns about ongoing bleeding from gastritis or an upper gastrointestinal source. The patient has a history of recent blood loss, as indicated by negative guaiac test results. It is important to trend hemoglobin levels and maintain good access for potential blood transfusions. An upper endoscopy is recommended to evaluate the source of bleeding.

The patient's renal failure is characterized by a creatinine level of 1.4, which may be acute or chronic. Given the lack of other medical comorbidities and the recent substance ingestion, it is more likely to be acute renal failure. Monitoring serum creatinine levels and urine analysis with sediment is advised to check for casts.

Depression is also noted as a diagnosis, considering the patient's suicide attempt. A psychiatry consult is recommended, and the patient may require an inpatient psychiatric admission after medical issues are resolved.

Other conditions mentioned in the note include hypertension, for which lisinopril should be withheld during"

The patient is a 30-year-old male who was found unresponsive in bed by his daughter with empty pill bottles of Seroquel and Paxil, along with a suicide note. The patient had ingested multiple substances, which likely caused sedation and altered mental status. The initial assessment reveals hypotension, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, depression, and hypertension. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He is also receiving IV fluids and medications such as propofol, pantoprazole, and antibiotics. Further diagnostic tests, including a CT head, ABG, EKG, and various lab results, are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged QRS: Given the patient's substance ingestion, there is a concern for prolonged QRS, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
2. Serotonin syndrome: Although not currently evident, the combination of substances ingested by the patient raises the possibility of serotonin syndrome, characterized by altered mental status, autonomic dysregulation, neuromuscular abnormalities, and gastrointestinal symptoms.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's melena and guaiac positive stool indicate ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to hypotension and potential shock if not managed promptly.
4. Renal failure: The elevated creatinine level suggests acute renal failure, which could be due to pre-renal causes such as hypotension"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male who was found unresponsive in his bed with empty pill bottles and a suicide note. He has ingested an overdose of Seroquel and Paxil, along with aspirin. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 115/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. He is alert and oriented with reactive pupils, supple neck, clear lung sounds, regular heart rhythm, and soft abdomen. Laboratory results show elevated levels of AST, ALT, CK, troponin-T, and LDH. The patient's condition requires close monitoring for potential complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, and hypertensive crisis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastritis and an elevated creatinine level, which may indicate possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results, especially hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, is necessary. If there are signs of bleeding, transfusion may be required.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's initial creatinine level was elevated at 1.9, which has improved to 1.2. It is important to continue monitoring kidney function by trending creatinine levels and adjusting medication dosages accordingly. Maintaining fluid balance and electrolyte repletion is also crucial"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 30-year-old male who was found unconscious in bed with empty pill bottles and a suicide note.
- He has been experiencing multiple medical complications including altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, respiratory failure, fever, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), renal failure, and hypertension.
- The AMS is suspected to be caused by multiple substance ingestion, which also caused the sedation.
- Hypotension is due to several factors including substance ingestion, sedation from propofol, GIB, and PEEP.
- The respiratory failure was secondary to sedation and inability to protect the airway in the emergency department.
- Fever is likely due to ingestion, blood loss, or products of infection.
- GIB is concerning for ongoing bleed, possibly from gastritis or upper GI bleed.
- Renal failure is acute and could be related to ATN from pre-renal etiology or intrinsic kidney damage from substance abuse.
- The patient has a history of depression and attempted suicide.
- He requires a psychiatry consult and may need inpatient psychiatric admission after medical problems are cleared.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged QRS due to substance ingestion.
2. Serotonin syndrome, although no evidence at this time.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to gastritis or upper GI bleed.
4. Renal failure, possibly acute-on-chronic or due to ATN from pre-renal etiology"
