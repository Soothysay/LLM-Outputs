   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with HTN, COPD, mild chronic diastolic dysfunction who presents
   with worsening SOB and dyspnea with exertion.
   # Hypercarbic/ Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Likely COPD exacerbation
   given he is not moving much air and has bilateral wheezing. Unlikely to
   be CHF or PNA given CXR findings and low BNP.  ABGs stable, slightly
   improved but hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.
   -methylprednisolone 125mg IV q8 hours X 72 hours
   -continue nebs
   -BIPAP, wean to face mask as tolerated
   -continue advair
   # Hyperkalemia: Multifactorial due to elevated glucose, acidosis
   causing potassium to shift out of cells, also Lisinopril contributing.
   No ECG changes.  Has improved to 4.9.
   - continue to monitor
   # elevated HCT: likely secondary to long standing COPD and sleep apnea.
   -continue to monitor
   # HTN: was initially hypertensive in the ED requiring nitro gtt.
   Currently off of this.
   -continue amlodipine and lasix
   -holding lisinopril given hyperkalemia; will restart in AM if
   postassium normalizes
   # DM2: uses herbal supplements at home. No medications. Currently
   hyperglycemic and now getting steroids.
   -insulin sliding scale and standing glargine
   -if glucose stays in the upper 300 range, consider insulin gtt. No gap
   currently.
   # diastolic CHF: chronic. Does not seem to be in acute failure.
   -not on BB likely secondary to COPD.
   -holding lisinopril for now given hyperkalemia
   # FEN: NPO for now while on BIPAP
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, bowel regimen, H2 blocker for GI ppx
   given high steroid use.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and mild chronic diastolic dysfunction. He presents with worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. The assessment indicates that the patient likely has hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure due to a suspected COPD exacerbation. There are also mentions of hyperkalemia, elevated hematocrit (HCT), hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and fluid electrolyte imbalance.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of COPD exacerbation leading to respiratory failure, further electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia, worsening of hypertension, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, progression of diastolic CHF, and possible development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, electrolyte levels, blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and any signs of heart failure or DVT. Timely intervention and management of these conditions are crucial to prevent further complications and improve the patient's overall health outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with HTN, COPD, mild chronic diastolic dysfunction who presents
   with worsening SOB and dyspnea with exertion.
   # Dyspnea: Likely COPD exacerbation given he is not moving much air and
   has bilateral wheezing. Other possibilities include CHF exacerbation
   (his CXR is a poor study but might suggest fluid overload although
   clinically does not show signs of fluid overload and BNP was only in
   the 400 range), pneumonia (no WBC or fever or cough though). Do not
   think this is influenza given no myalgias, fevers or cough and has been
   going on for two weeks.
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -methylprednisolone
   -continue nebs
   -BIPAP
   -send ABG now
   -continue advair
   # hyperkalemia: unknown cause although does have elevated glucose.

   baseline. Repeat potassium was 5.4. Repeat EKG on arrival was ok.
   -already given calcium gluconate in ED.
   -monitor postassium
   -EKG in AM
   -monitor on tele
   # elevated HCT: likely secondary to long standing COPD and sleep apnea.
   -continue to monitor
   # HTN: was initially hypertensive in the ED requiring nitro gtt.
   Currently off of this.
   -continue amlodipine and lasix
   -holding lisinopril given hyperkalemia; will restart in AM if
   postassium normalizes
   # HTN: continue amlodipine and lasix. Hold lisinopril as above
   # DM2: uses herbal supplements at home. No medications. Currently
   hyperglycemic and now getting steroids.
   -insulin sliding scale and likely will need standing insulin as well
   -will calculate based on overnight needs.
   -if glucose stays in the upper 300 range, consider insulin gtt. No gap
   currently.
   # diastolic CHF: chronic. Does not seem to be in acute failure.
   -not on BB likely secondary to COPD.
   -holding lisinopril for now given hyperkalemia

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with worsening dyspnea and failed to respond to a short course of prednisone at home. He was given steroids and Lasix in the emergency department (ED) and put on BIPAP support, which was well tolerated. The patient was then admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. 

Key findings include persistent wheezes upon admission without clear evidence of persistent volume overload, hyperkalemia treated overnight with good effect, and bilateral lower lobe opacities on chest X-ray indicating effusion and/or atelectasis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate (HR) of 91 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 133/99 to 104/71 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 90%. The patient's current weight is 99 kg, and he has been receiving IV fluids and BIPAP support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, indicative of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) type II. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits except for hyperkalemia, which has been resolved. His white blood cell (WBC) count is slightly elevated, while his platelet (Plt) count is within normal range. The patient's"

   # Hypercarbic/ Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Cause unclear.  Could be
   COPD exacerbation given he was not moving much air and had bilateral
   wheezing on presentation. Unlikely to be CHF or PNA given CXR findings
   and low BNP though may be somewhat volume overloaded.  ABGs stable,
   slightly improved but hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.
   -methylprednisolone 125mg IV q8 hours X 72 hours
   -continue nebs
   -BIPAP, wean to face mask as tolerated
   -continue advair
   -diurese today with Lasix 40 mg IV
   -ECHO to assess for CHF
   -CTA to r/o PE (low probability) if no further improvement after above
   # Hyperkalemia: Now resolved.  Multifactorial due to elevated glucose,
   acidosis causing potassium to shift out of cells, also Lisinopril
   contributing. No ECG changes.  Has improved to 4.3.
   - continue to monitor
   # elevated HCT: likely secondary to long standing COPD and sleep apnea.
   -continue to monitor
   # HTN: was initially hypertensive in the ED requiring nitro gtt.
   Currently off of this.
   -continue amlodipine and lasix
   -lisinopril initially held given hyperkalemia; will consider resuming
   # DM2: uses herbal supplements at home. No medications. Currently
   hyperglycemic and now getting steroids.
   -increase insulin sliding scale
   # diastolic CHF: chronic. Does not seem to be in acute failure.
   -not on BB likely secondary to COPD.
   -will consider restarting lisinopril

However, he remains hypoxic and has hypercarbic respiratory acidosis. The cause of his respiratory failure is unclear, but it could be due to a COPD exacerbation. Other possible causes such as congestive heart failure (CHF) or pneumonia (PNA) are less likely based on the chest X-ray findings and low B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic/ Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is characterized by hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide levels). This condition could be due to a COPD exacerbation, although the exact cause is unclear. The patient has been placed on bipap support, which helps improve oxygenation but does not resolve the underlying problem completely.

2. Hyperkalemia: Initially, the patient had elevated potassium levels, which have now resolved. This could be due to several factors, including elevated glucose levels causing potassium to shift out of cells, acidosis, and the use of Lisinopril.

3. Elevated Hematocrit (HCT):"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and mild chronic diastolic dysfunction. He presents with worsening shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. The patient is currently on bipap support, and his arterial blood gases (ABGs) are stable with slight improvement but remain hypoxic and hypercarbic with respiratory acidosis. The physical examination reveals obesity, mildly tachypneic, and wheezing on expiration bilaterally. There are no signs of jugular venous distention (JVD), crackles, or rhonchi. Laboratory results show hyperkalemia, elevated hematocrit (HCT), and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory symptoms, lack of air movement, and bilateral wheezing suggest a possible exacerbation of COPD. This could lead to further respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and require careful monitoring and treatment.
3. Elevated HCT: The high hematocrit level may indicate polycythemia, which can be secondary to chronic hypoxia from underlying lung diseases such as COPD or sleep apnea. Polycythemia can increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's hyperglycemia may indicate poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with HTN, COPD, mild chronic diastolic dysfunction who presents
   with worsening SOB and dyspnea with exertion.
   # Hypercarbic/ Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Cause unclear.  Could be
   COPD exacerbation given he was not moving much air and had bilateral
   wheezing on presentation. Unlikely to be CHF or PNA given CXR findings
   and low BNP though may be somewhat volume overloaded.  ABGs stable,
   slightly improved but hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory acidosis.
   -methylprednisolone 125mg IV q8 hours X 72 hours
   -continue nebs
   -BIPAP, wean to face mask as tolerated
   -continue advair
   -diurese today with Lasix 40 mg IV
   -ECHO to assess for CHF
   -CTA to r/o PE (low probability) if no further improvement after above
   # Hyperkalemia: Now resolved.  Multifactorial due to elevated glucose,
   acidosis causing potassium to shift out of cells, also Lisinopril
   contributing. No ECG changes.  Has improved to 4.3.
   - continue to monitor
   # elevated HCT: likely secondary to long standing COPD and sleep apnea.
   -continue to monitor
   # HTN: was initially hypertensive in the ED requiring nitro gtt.
   Currently off of this.
   -continue amlodipine and lasix
   -lisinopril initially held given hyperkalemia; will consider resuming
   # DM2: uses herbal supplements at home. No medications. Currently
   hyperglycemic and now getting steroids.
   -increase insulin sliding scale
   # diastolic CHF: chronic. Does not seem to be in acute failure.
   -not on BB likely secondary to COPD.
   -will consider restarting lisinopril
   -ECHO to assess for CHF

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and mild chronic diastolic dysfunction. The patient presented with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and dyspnea with exertion. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: The cause is unclear, but it could be a COPD exacerbation due to the patient not moving much air and having bilateral wheezing on presentation. Unlikely to be congestive heart failure (CHF) or pneumonia (PNA) given CXR findings and low B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. ABGs are stable, slightly improved but hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory acidosis. 
   - Continue nebs (nebulized bronchodilators)
   - BIPAP (bi-level positive airway pressure), wean to face mask as tolerated
   - Continue Advair (fluticasone and salmeterol)
   - Diurese today with Lasix 40 mg IV
   - ECHO (echocardiogram) to assess for CHF
   - CT angiography (CTA) to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) if no further improvement after above interventions.
