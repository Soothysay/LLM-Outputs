   Images:
   CXR ([**8-8**]):
   IMPRESSION: Persistent bilateral alveolar opacities superimposed upon
   underlying interstitial abnormality.
   Although potentially due to pulmonary edema, the differential diagnosis
   is broad and includes widespread pneumonia (including PCP if patient is
   immune suppressed), pulmonary hemorrhage, and chronic processes such as
   alveolar proteinosis and bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma.
   Continued radiographic followup recommended. If the diagnosis remains
   in doubt clinically, high- resolution chest CT may be helpful. At that
   time, the mediastinum can also be reassessed to distinguish distended
   vessels from lymphadenopathy.
   .
   CXR ([**8-9**]): post-intubation. Bilateral alveolar opacities superimposed
   upon underlying interstitial abnormality, slightly worsened compared to
   the one from the day prior.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and respiratory distress.
   .
   #) Respiratory distress: Pt is now s/p intubation. Differential for
   patient's respiratory distress at this time remains broad. She
   describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks, however relatively acute
   onset of shortness of breath today on day of presentation.
   Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a picture of just
   CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if this was the whole
   story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process; given
   her chest x-ray an atypical process such as legionella or mycoplasma
   would be higher on the differential. Viral process (such as varicella,
   CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no known risk factors for
   PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be rheumatologic processes
   (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL),
   institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH,
   and suctions from ETT showed no rustic blood color.  Patient meets the
   criteria for ARDS as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200
   and pt has bilateral infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of
   ARDS, could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or
   inhalation in the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no
   h/o transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - pt is s/p intubation. compliance low, around 20, resistance 6. Use
   ARDS NET protocol for ventilation as pt is possilby ARDS.
   - clarify ideal wt based on height, and calculate Vt based on 6cc/kg
   ideal wt
   - f/u Sputum culture, Legionella urinary antigen, viral culture
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA, CMV IgM/IgG
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin (patient with allergy to PCN,
   details unknown, tolerated CTX in ED)
   - clarify with patient
s family or PCP re [**Name9 (PRE) 10065**] allergy, if not
   severe allergy, can give CTX
   - non-contrast chest CT to further detail lung process
   - may also consider bronchoscopy and BAL
   - Checking urine analysis to eval for vasculitic process
   - no further diuresis as pt appears to dry on exam
   .
   #) Anemia: baseline hct around 35, differential broad and includes
   anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. No hemoptysis to
   suggest DAH, however this is still a possibility.
   - Guaiac stools
   - iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia
   of inflammation, B12 and folate normal
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH (likely from
   lung process).
   - Urine lytes, Osm, serum Osm
   - Follow trend
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO currently, get Nutrition consult to start TF
   Glycemic Control: Insulin sliding scale if needed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral alveolar opacities superimposed on underlying interstitial abnormality, which could be consistent with pulmonary edema, widespread pneumonia (including PCP if the patient is immune suppressed), pulmonary hemorrhage, or chronic processes such as alveolar proteinosis and bronchoalveolar carcinoma. The differential diagnosis for the patient's respiratory distress is broad, and further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause.

The patient meets the criteria for ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), which is characterized by acute onset, PaO2/FiO2 <200, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury. There is no evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o transfusion, trauma, drowning, or burn. 

The patient has been placed on the ARDS NET (Network) protocol for ventilation and is receiving vancomycin and levofloxacin. The plan is to follow up on sputum culture, Legionella urinary antigen, and viral culture. Additionally, ANCA, CMV IgM/IgG tests are ordered, and a non-contrast chest CT is recommended to further detail the lung process. Bronchoscopy and BAL may also be considered. The patient's urine analysis will be evaluated for vasculitic process.

The patient's anemia is attributed to chronic disease, iron deficiency, or other causes. No evidence of hemoptysis suggests DAH (disseminated intravascular hemolysis), but this remains a possibility. Iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation.

The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) associated with the lung process. Further evaluation of urine lytes, Osm, serum Osm, and following the trend is advised.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) currently, and a nutrition consult is needed to start total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Insulin sliding scale is used for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including arterial lines, and is receiving prophylaxis for DVT (deep vein thrombosis), stress ulcers, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia).

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary. Further investigations and interventions are required to determine the underlying cause of the patient's respiratory distress and to guide appropriate management."

   describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks, however relatively acute
   onset of shortness of breath today on day of presentation.
   Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a picture of just
   CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if this was the whole
   story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process; given
   her chest x-ray an atypical process such as legionella or mycoplasma
   would be higher on the differential. Viral process (such as varicella,
   CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no known risk factors for
   PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be rheumatologic processes
   (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL),
   institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH,
   and suctions from ETT showed no rustic blood color.  Patient meets the
   criteria for ARDS as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200
   and pt has bilateral infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of
   ARDS, could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or
   inhalation in the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no
   h/o transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to intubation and the initiation of invasive ventilation. She is also on arterial line monitoring. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has been receiving antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is a primary concern and has necessitated intubation. The differential diagnosis for her respiratory distress includes congestive heart failure (CHF), atypical pneumonia, viral process, pulmonary-renal syndromes, interstitial lung diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and bronchoalveolar carcinoma. ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) is also suspected.
2. Infectious process: The patient's fevers suggest an infectious process, with possible causes including atypical pneumonia, viral infection, or bacterial infection. Further diagnostic tests, such as sputum culture, Legionella urinary antigen, and viral culture, are needed.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be due to various causes, including anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, or other factors. Additional tests, such as guaiac stools, iron studies, and B12/folate levels, are necessary to determine the underlying cause.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia"

   CXR ([**8-8**]):
   IMPRESSION: Persistent bilateral alveolar opacities superimposed upon
   underlying interstitial abnormality.
   Although potentially due to pulmonary edema, the differential diagnosis
   is broad and includes widespread pneumonia (including PCP if patient is
   immune suppressed), pulmonary hemorrhage, and chronic processes such as
   alveolar proteinosis and bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma.
   Continued radiographic followup recommended. If the diagnosis remains
   in doubt clinically, high- resolution chest CT may be helpful. At that
   time, the mediastinum can also be reassessed to distinguish distended
   vessels from lymphadenopathy.
   .
   CXR ([**8-9**]): post-intubation. Bilateral alveolar opacities superimposed
   upon underlying interstitial abnormality, slightly worsened compared to
   the one from the day prior.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and respiratory distress.
   .
   #) Respiratory distress: Pt is now s/p intubation. Differential for
   patient's respiratory distress at this time remains broad. She
   describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks, however relatively acute
   onset of shortness of breath today on day of presentation.
   Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a picture of just
   CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if this was the whole
   story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process; given
   her chest x-ray an atypical process such as legionella or mycoplasma
   would be higher on the differential. Viral process (such as varicella,
   CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no known risk factors for
   PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be rheumatologic processes
   (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL),
   institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH,
   and suctions from ETT showed no rustic blood color.  Patient meets the
   criteria for ARDS as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200
   and pt has bilateral infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of
   ARDS, could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or
   inhalation in the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no
   h/o transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - pt is s/p intubation. compliance low, around 20. Use ARDS NET
   protocol for ventilation as pt is possilby ARDS.
   - f/u Sputum culture, Legionella urinary antigen, viral culture
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA, CMV IgM/IgG
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin (patient with allergy to PCN,
   details unknown, tolerated CTX in ED)
   - non-contrast chest CT to further detail lung process; may also
   consider bronchoscopy if above are unrevealing
   - Checking urine analysis to eval for vasculitic process
   - no further diuresis as pt appears to dry on exam
   .
   #) Fevers: Suspect infectious process, most likely from lung as
   discussed above.
   - Sputum, blood, urine cultures
   .
   #) Anemia: Unknown baseline HCT, differential broad and includes anemia
   of chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH,
   however this is still a possibility.
   - Guaiac stools
   - iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia
   of inflammation, B12 and folate normal
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   - Try to obtain further data from PCP (if she has seen one since
   [**5-/2158**], given it would have to be out of our system)
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH (likely from
   lung process).
   - Urine lytes, Osm, serum Osm
   - Follow trend

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. She has been intubated and is currently on invasive ventilation with arterial line placement. Her chest x-ray shows bilateral alveolar opacities superimposed upon underlying interstitial abnormality, slightly worsened compared to the previous day.

The differential diagnosis for her respiratory distress includes congestive heart failure (CHF), atypical pneumonia (such as Legionella or mycoplasma), viral process (such as varicella or CMV), rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes), interstitial lung diseases (UIP/AIP/DIP), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No evidence of CHF, pancreatitis, sepsis, transfusion, trauma, drowning, or burn is noted. She meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as it is acute, with bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200.

The patient has been started on the ARDS NET protocol for ventilation. She is also on vancomycin and levofloxacin due to suspected infectious process, most likely from the lung. Further tests include sputum culture, Legionella urinary antigen, viral culture, ANCA, CMV IgM/Ig"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The differential diagnosis for her respiratory distress includes atypical pneumonia, viral pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, and others. The patient's chest X-ray shows persistent bilateral infiltrates. She is currently being treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin. Further diagnostic tests include sputum culture, Legionella urinary antigen, viral culture, ANCA, CMV IgM/IgG, and a non-contrast chest CT to further detail the lung process. Bronchoscopy and BAL may also be considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, which is characterized by acute onset, PaO2/FiO2 <200, and bilateral infiltrates on CXR. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury.
2. Anemia: The patient's baseline HCT is around 35, and her differential includes anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH, however this is still a possibility.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hy"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and respiratory distress.
   .
   #) ARDS: Pt is now s/p intubation and bronchoscopy. Differential for
   patient's respiratory distress at this time remains broad. She
   describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks, however relatively acute
   onset of shortness of breath today on day of presentation.
   Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a picture of just
   CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if this was the whole
   story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process; given
   her chest x-ray an atypical process such as legionella or mycoplasma
   would be higher on the differential. Viral process (such as varicella,
   CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no known risk factors for
   PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be rheumatologic processes
   (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL),
   institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH,
   and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic blood color or
   alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS as it is acute,
   no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral infiltrates on
   CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be aspiration
   pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in the
   environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o transfusion,
   trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - continue ARDS NET protocol for ventilation, Vt 350 and Pplateau
   25-30.
   - f/u Sputum and BAL culture culture and other cultures
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin for now
   - check vanc trough tomorrow morning
   - non-contrast chest CT to further detail lung process
   - repeat urine analysis to eval for vasculitic process as pt has
   respiratory failure, renal failure, anemia and positive [**Doctor First Name **].
   - f/u TTE to eval cardiac function
   - no further diuresis as pt appears to dry on exam
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - check LFT, c. diff to rule out GI source for sepsis
   - continue Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin
   - continue to follow cultures
   - TTE to check for valvular vegetations
   . .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr went down from 1.1 to 2.3 from yesterday to
   today. In the setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question
   patient has pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive
   of this possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive.
   - get UA, urine lytes
   - renal US to rule out hydronephrosis or other renal pathologies
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] titer
   - order anti-GBM
   - renal consult today, f/u recs
   .
   #) Anemia: baseline hct around 35, differential broad and includes
   anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation,
   B12 and folate normal. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH, however this is
   still a possibility.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   - continue workup for vasculitis as above
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is supported by the acute onset of shortness of breath, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200. The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, as it is acute, without evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF), and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio meets the required threshold.

The differential diagnosis for the precipitate of ARDS includes aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, inhalation injury, pancreatitis, sepsis, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), trauma, drowning, or burn. However, the patient does not have a history of pancreatitis, sepsis, transfusion, trauma, drowning, or burn.

The patient also meets the criteria for sepsis, and the source of infection is most likely pulmonary, given the presence of fevers and respiratory distress. Other potential sources of infection include the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but the patient had no GI complaints on admission. Skin breakdown is another possible source, but the patient does not have any evidence of skin breakdown.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by an increase in creatinine from"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo with admission with hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS with
   initial insult remaining to be defined but do have viral, aspiration or
   environmental/inhalational trigger perhaps most likely.  We had been
   impressed with high fevers driving concern for infectious source to the
   forefront.  In addition, we now have pressor requiring hypotension and
   acute renal failure evolving.
   1)Respiratory Failure-ARDS-
   -Will continue with lung protective ventilation strategy and have had
   good capacity to wean FIO2 at current PEEP levels
   -Will continue with volume cycled ventilation
   -ABG as needed
   -Can move to PCV mode if patient syncrhony becomes an issue
   In regards to treatment of source-
   -Will continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   -Will pursue CT scan for better definition of infiltrates and review
   with chest radiologists
   -No role for biopsy at this time given risk but will have to look to
   chest CT to aid in management approach
   2)Hypotension
Likely vasodilatory source of compromise as CVP adequate
   and is likely SIRS process
   -ECHO today and CvO2 to confirm high output state
   -Will continue to Rx with current ABX and monitor for new evidence of
   infection
   -Levophed as needed
   -Will pursue LFT
s, T. Bili, etc.
   3)Acute Renal Failure-Concerning for ATN in this setting and with
   sudden rise.
   -Will check urine lytes
   -Will check renal ultrasound
   -Will need review of urine for possible impact in regards to
   glomerulonephritis which was not seen at presentation.
   -Renal consult to consider vasculitis, review urine
   -Will add on Anti-GBM
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old individual admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. The initial insult causing ARDS is still unknown, but there are concerns for viral, aspiration, or environmental/inhalational triggers. The patient also has high fevers, requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics, and has developed acute renal failure. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a lung-protective strategy, and ABG analysis will be done as needed. The treatment plan involves pursuing a CT scan to better define infiltrates, reviewing with chest radiologists, and considering a biopsy if necessary. The patient's hypotension is likely vasodilatory, possibly due to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) process. An ECHO today and CVO2 will be performed to confirm a high-output state. Levophed will be used as needed, and current antibiotics will be monitored for new evidence of infection. LFTs, T. Bili, etc. will also be pursued. The patient's acute renal failure may be concerning for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and will be evaluated with urine electrolytes, renal ultrasound, and a renal consult to consider vasculitis. Anti-GBM will be added on. Additional issues, such as fever of unknown origin (FUO), respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and constipation, will be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of this date.

   TTE:  The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with distal septal hypokinesis. The overall LVEF
   is preserved. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline free wall
   contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
   regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At
   least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and respiratory distress.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation.
   Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a picture of just
   CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if this was the whole
   story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process; given
   her chest x-ray an atypical process such as legionella or mycoplasma
   would be higher on the differential. Viral process (such as varicella,
   CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no known risk factors for
   PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be rheumatologic processes
   (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL),
   institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH,
   and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic blood color or
   alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS as it is acute,
   no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral infiltrates on
   CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be aspiration
   pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in the
   environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o transfusion,
   trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - continue ARDS NET protocol for ventilation, Vt 350 and Pplateau
   25-30.
   - f/u CT chest read
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin for now
   - f/u on vanc trough from this morning
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and bronchoscoped. Her chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrates, which are not completely consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). She did not respond to lasix as expected if CHF was the main issue. Her fevers are suggestive of an infectious process, and given her chest x-ray, an atypical process such as Legionella or Mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral processes (such as varicella, CMV) are also possible. She has no known risk factors for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).

The patient meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to acute onset of respiratory distress, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury. There is no evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no history of transfusion, trauma, drowning, or burn. No history of drug overdose either.

The patient also meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of sources of infection, pulmonary infection is high on the differential. GI sources are also possible but the patient had no GI complaint on admission"

   cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with distal septal hypokinesis. The overall LVEF
   is preserved. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline free wall
   contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
   regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At
   least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and respiratory distress.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation.
   Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a picture of just
   CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if this was the whole
   story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process; given
   her chest x-ray an atypical process such as legionella or mycoplasma
   would be higher on the differential. Viral process (such as varicella,
   CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no known risk factors for
   PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be rheumatologic processes
   (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL),
   institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH,
   and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic blood color or
   alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS as it is acute,
   no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral infiltrates on
   CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be aspiration
   pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in the
   environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o transfusion,
   trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.

   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. She has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrates, suggesting an infectious process such as pneumonia. Other possible causes for her symptoms include CHF, pulmonary-renal syndromes, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. She also has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension. Anemia and hyponatremia are also present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray suggest ARDS, which can lead to severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, with suspected pulmonary infection as the source. This can lead to organ dysfunction and systemic inflammation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, indicated by elevated serum creatinine and urine output below the normal range. ATN is the likely cause, which can worsen over the next few days.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level and a broad differential including anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency. Further investigation"

   Imaging:
   TTE:  The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with distal septal hypokinesis. The overall LVEF
   is preserved. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline free wall
   contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
   regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At
   least moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   CXR (my read):  persistent diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrate
   .
   Renal US: No hydronephrosis or acute renal abnormality.
   .
   Chest CT:
   Findings are consistenet with provided history of acute
   respiratory distress syndrome, possibly with a small component of
   superimposed fluid overload, but they are not specific for this entity.
   Other
   diagnostic considerations include viral pneumonia and, in the
   appropriate setting, pulmonary hemorrhage.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and respiratory distress.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, 18/12, FiO2 50%, continue this setting for now
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin for now
   - hold vanc for today as vanc trough 25.3 in the setting of ARF
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - check c. diff to rule out GI source
   - continue Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin
   - continue to follow cultures
   - monitor lactate
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: FeNa 0.36, Urine Na 18, consistent with
   pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy brown casts, most likely
   ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the setting of ARDS with
   bilateral infiltrate, question patient has pulmonary
renal
   syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this possible diagnosis.
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive.
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs
   - per renal, expect renal function to worsen for several days.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   consider CVVH in next few days.
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable at this time. baseline hct around 35,
   differential broad and includes anemia of chronic disease, iron
   deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, however this is still a possibility.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).

   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. The patient's chest x-ray shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, which are consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has acute renal failure, as indicated by the presence of muddy brown casts and a pre-renal etiology. There is also evidence of sepsis, with pulmonary infection being a high differential.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis. Pulmonary infection is a likely source of infection, but other sources should be considered as well. Cultures should be followed, and lactate levels should be monitored.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has pre-renal azotemia with a FeNa of 0.36 and urine Na of 18. Maintaining adequate renal perfusion is crucial. The patient's renal function is expected to worsen in the next few days, and consideration should be given to continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable at this time, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of anemia. Iron studies are consistent with an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated, sedated, and unresponsive. Vital signs include a temperature of 102.9°F, blood pressure of 94/42 mmHg, heart rate of 65 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a history of abdominal pain, allergies to specific medications, and a previous admission with similar symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and hypotension may indicate an infection leading to sepsis. This is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS may worsen if not properly managed. This can lead to further respiratory failure and difficulty in oxygenation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. Monitoring renal parameters and ensuring adequate fluid balance is crucial to prevent further renal deterioration.
4. Constipation: The patient's sedation and immobility increase the risk of constipation. Proper bowel management and stool softeners may be necessary to prevent complications.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), hypotension, anemia, and is mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are unstable with high fever, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, increased lactate levels, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. Chest X-ray and CT scan show widespread ground glass and consolidative infiltrates with small effusions. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, renal replacement therapy, and nutritional support. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), progression of renal failure, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and further deterioration of the patient's overall condition. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, hemodynamic stability, renal function, and coagulation status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are unstable with a fever of 102.9 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 94/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated lactate levels. Imaging shows widespread ground glass and consolidative infiltrates on chest CT and stable bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progression of ARDS: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and decreased oxygenation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may progress, leading to increased infection and potential sepsis.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI, which could require renal replacement therapy.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypotension, which could lead to organ perfusion issues.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. The patient was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, renal failure, fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and constipation. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and various medications to manage his conditions. The patient's vital signs have been stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, blood pressure ranging from 94/42-58 mmHg, heart rate between 65-88 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. The patient's renal function has progressively deteriorated, as indicated by the increasing serum creatinine levels. The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with ongoing need for mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive renal failure: The patient's renal function has worsened over time, as indicated by the increasing serum creatinine levels. This can lead to further fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and accumulation of waste products in the body.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, requiring ongoing mechanical ventilation support. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in lung"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who is currently intubated and admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been improving, with stabilization of vital signs and decreased reliance on pressors. However, the patient remains hypotensive and is being closely monitored. There has been a worsening of renal function, and the patient is now diagnosed with acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's hemoglobin levels have also decreased, indicating anemia. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and continues to require ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be necessary to detect any early signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be administered to prevent DVT formation.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and critical illness can predispose the patient to stress ulcers. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are being given to reduce the risk.
4. Renal function deterioration: The patient's renal function has worsened, indicating possible progression of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is suffering from multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has stable bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray, indicating respiratory distress. They are receiving ventilator support and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and efforts are being made to manage this condition.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is worsening, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Discussions are underway regarding the possibility of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) as a renal replacement therapy.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit level is lower than before, and transfusion of blood products is being considered.

5. Nutrition: The patient is receiving a specialized pulmonary formula through enteral nutrition.

6. Glycemic control: Efforts are being made to maintain stable blood sugar levels.

7. Lines and monitoring: Multiple lines, including arterial and central venous lines, have been placed for ongoing monitoring and treatment.

8. Prophylaxis: Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention are being implemented.

9. Code status: The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of allergies to Simvastatin, niacin, sulfonamides, penicillins, and enalapril. He is on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.6°F, blood pressure ranging from 89/41 mmHg to 125/58 mmHg, heart rate of 69 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's flow sheet data indicates that he has received a total of 2,171 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 343 mL of urine and 746 mL of tube feedings. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.29, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 198, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7.2 g/dL, platelet count of 271 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.3 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 112 mg/dL, and total bilirubin (T. Bil) level of 0.5 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, hypotension, acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), anemia, and other medical conditions. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and mechanical ventilation support. The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics and ventilator support, discussing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for renal support, and managing the patient's other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly managed.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests impaired renal function, which can progress to AKI if not addressed appropriately. CVVH may be considered for renal support.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): P"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and respiratory distress.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or [**Known lastname **] would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, 18/12, FiO2 50%, continue this setting for now  as
   O2 sats are 92-93 on this setting, wouldn
t decrease FiO2 or PEE yet
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin, add aztreonam for broader coverage
   - hold vanc for today as vanc trough 21.6 today
   - follow all cultures
   - if this is severe viral pneumonia leading to ARDS (which is possible
   despite negative viral cultures), need to be patient, and patient might
   turn the corner later
   - lung bx would be the last option when everything fails, not at this
   point yet
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - check c. diff to rule out GI source
   - continue Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin
   - continue to follow all cultures
   - monitor lactate
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend up.  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na
   18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy brown
   casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the setting of
   ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has pulmonary
renal
   syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this possible diagnosis.
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive.
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - per renal, expect renal function to worsen for several days.
   - consider starting RRT today
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct 21.5 today. baseline hct around 35, differential broad
   and includes anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. iron
   studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia of
   inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH,
   however this is still a possibility.
   - Guaiac stools
   - give 1u pRBC and check pm Hct
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).
   - Follow trend
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated. Had some hand shakiness and muscle
   twitches when hands were lifted up. Possibly secondary to uremia and
   metabolic acidosis
   - continue to follow, this is the least of her problems at this point
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and bronchoscoped, and her differential diagnosis includes ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, anemia, and hyponatremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Progression of ARDS: The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, which is characterized by acute onset, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200. Complications of ARDS can include respiratory failure, pneumonia, and multiorgan dysfunction.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Complications of sepsis can include organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and septic shock.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening renal function. Complications of acute renal failure can include fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT).

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. Complications of anemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and respiratory distress.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or [**Known lastname **] would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, 18/12, FiO2 50%, continue this setting for now
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin for now
   - hold vanc for today as vanc trough 25.3 in the setting of ARF
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - check c. diff to rule out GI source
   - continue Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin
   - continue to follow cultures
   - monitor lactate
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: FeNa 0.36, Urine Na 18, consistent with
   pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy brown casts, most likely
   ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the setting of ARDS with
   bilateral infiltrate, question patient has pulmonary
renal
   syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this possible diagnosis.
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive.
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs
   - per renal, expect renal function to worsen for several days.  [**Month (only) 51**]
   consider CVVH in next few days.
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable at this time. baseline hct around 35,
   differential broad and includes anemia of chronic disease, iron
   deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, however this is still a possibility.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).
   - Follow trend

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and underwent a bronchoscopy. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), and she did not respond to lasix as expected if CHF was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process, and given her chest x-ray, an atypical process such as Legionella or CMV would be higher on the differential. Viral processes (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilities. She has no known risk factors for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).

The patient meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as it is acute, with no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200, and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no history of transfusion, trauma, drowning, or burn. No history of drug overdose either.

The patient also meets the criteria for sepsis, with a focus on pulmonary infection being high on the differential. GI sources are also possible but the patient had no GI complaint on admission"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. She was intubated and received bronchoscopy. The patient meets the criteria for ARDS and sepsis. She also has acute renal failure with muddy brown casts, suggesting acute tubular necrosis. Her anemia is likely due to anemia of chronic disease or inflammation. She had resolved hyponatremia, possibly from a lung process. She is sedated and has some hand shakiness and muscle twitches.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray suggest ARDS. It is important to continue with current ventilator settings and monitor oxygen saturation levels.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, and pulmonary infection is a high possibility. It is important to continue following cultures, check for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and monitor lactate levels.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function. Maintaining renal perfusion and considering renal replacement therapy (RRT) are crucial.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and her iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease or inflammation. Further evaluation of the cause of an"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and respiratory distress.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or [**Known lastname **] would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, 30/12, FiO2 50%, continue this setting for now  as
   O2 sats are 92-93 on this setting, wouldn
t decrease FiO2 or PEE yet
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam
   - ID c/s as pt is still spiking fevers with no known source
   - f/u Vanc trough today and redose if needed
   - follow all cultures
   - lung bx would be the last option when everything fails, not at this
   point yet as risk vs benefit ratio too high
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - check c. diff to rule out GI source
   - continue Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin
   - continue to follow all cultures
   - monitor lactate
   - check LFTs
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend up.  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na
   18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy brown
   casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the setting of
   ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has pulmonary
renal
   syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this possible diagnosis.
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA neg.
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs re: starting dialysis
   - use Bicarb if needed per renal
   .
   #) Anemia:  differential broad and includes anemia of chronic disease,
   iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No
   hemoptysis to suggest DAH, however this is still a possibility.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).
   - Follow trend
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated. Had some hand shakiness and muscle
   twitches when hands were lifted up. Possibly secondary to uremia and
   metabolic acidosis
   - continue to follow, this is the least of her problems at this point
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's chest X-ray shows persistent bilateral infiltrates. The differential diagnosis includes ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, acute renal failure, anemia, hyponatremia, and mental status changes. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics and supportive care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest ARDS. If not managed properly, this condition can lead to worsening hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, elevated white blood cell count, and presence of infection risk factors suggest sepsis. If not treated promptly, sepsis can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and muddy brown casts indicate acute tubular necrosis. This condition can progress to severe renal failure, requiring dialysis.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels and anemia of chronic disease or inflammation should be closely monitored. Severe anemia can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
5. Hyponatremia: Although resolved in this"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo female with initial admission with hypoxemic respiratory failure
   and now with persistent elevations in fever, worsening hypotension and
   now with pressor support required across past 24 hours.  The source for
   this remains to be defined--we have seen some significant worsening
   despite ongoing antibiotic support and support of blood pressure with
   volume and with pressors at this time.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with persistent hypoxemic respiratory
   failure.  This has been despite broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and
   extensive testing to date.  This is quite atypical for viral infection
   given course and severity.  This may well represent persistent ARDS
   with initial insult yet to be defined.
   -Vanco/Levo/Aztreonam
   -Reaonable to consult ID in the setting of persistent fevers and broad
   spectrum empiric antibiotics
   -Will continue to support with PCV this morning
no need for alteration
   in mode of support at this time.
   -Did discuss possible role for steroid Rx but with such persistent and
   elevated pressures and need for pressor support is most likely
   infectious insult
   2)Sepsis-Persistent fevers seen, continued hypotension noted with CVP
   markedly elevated.
   -Will continue with Vanco/Levo/Aztreonam
   -Will check urine/blood/sputum cultures
   -Will re-check LFT
s and consider abdominal imaging
   -Levophed restarted, will work to keep fluid balance as close to even
   as possible
   3)Renal Failure-Clearly most consistent with ATN given findings on U/A
   and sepsis and without obstruction on Renal Ultrasound.
   -Patient with worsening renal function in the setting of Sepsis and
   ARDS
   -Renal consult in place
   -Will have to consider dialysis with worsening of electrolye or volume
   status
   -Will need to utilize HCO3 as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with initial admission for hypoxemic respiratory failure and now presents with persistent elevations in fever, worsening hypotension, and ongoing need for pressure control ventilation. The source of the infection remains unidentified despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and extensive testing. The patient's respiratory failure is severe and atypical for a viral infection, suggesting persistent ARDS with an initial insult yet to be defined. She also has sepsis with persistent fevers and continued hypotension, renal failure consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and fever of unknown origin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and support from pressure control ventilation. This may represent persistent ARDS with an initial insult yet to be identified.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and hypotension indicate ongoing sepsis. The source of infection has not been identified, and there is a need for further evaluation and management.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, likely due to sepsis and ARDS. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most consistent diagnosis based on the findings on urinalysis and the absence of obstruction on renal ultrasound. Renal consultation is in place, and consideration should be given to dialysis if electrolyte or volume status worsens.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who presents with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and respiratory distress.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or [**Known lastname **] would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, 30/12, FiO2 50%, continue this setting for now  as
   O2 sats are 92-93 on this setting, wouldn
t decrease FiO2 or PEE yet
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam
   - ID c/s as pt is still spiking fevers with no known source
   - f/u Vanc trough today and redose if needed
   - follow all cultures
   - lung bx would be the last option when everything fails, not at this
   point yet as risk vs benefit ratio too high
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - check c. diff to rule out GI source
   - continue Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin
   - continue to follow all cultures
   - monitor lactate
   - check LFTs
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend up.  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na
   18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy brown
   casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the setting of
   ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has pulmonary
renal
   syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this possible diagnosis.
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA neg.
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs re: starting dialysis
   - use Bicarb if needed per renal
   .
   #) Anemia:  differential broad and includes anemia of chronic disease,
   iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No
   hemoptysis to suggest DAH, however this is still a possibility.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).
   - Follow trend
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated. Had some hand shakiness and muscle
   twitches when hands were lifted up. Possibly secondary to uremia and
   metabolic acidosis
   - continue to follow, this is the least of her problems at this point
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presents with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and underwent bronchoscopy. 

The differential diagnosis for her respiratory distress includes ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, and pulmonary infection. The chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates, which are not consistent with congestive heart failure. The patient's fevers suggest an infectious process, and atypical pneumonia should be considered. 

The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, which is characterized by acute onset, no evidence of congestive heart failure, PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury. 

In addition, the patient has acute renal failure with an increasing creatinine level and muddy brown casts, indicating acute tubular necrosis possibly secondary to hypotension. The patient's anemia is supportive of pulmonary-renal syndrome/vasculitis, but ANCA is negative. 

Other potential complications or conditions include hyponatremia (resolved), mental status changes (possibly secondary to uremia and metabolic acidosis), and anemia (with a broad differential including anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc.).

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, continue current settings as pt did not tolerate
   other modes and settings well
   - continue meropenam and azithro as per ID
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u Vanc trough today and redose if needed
   - follow all cultures
   - will opt against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   - consider empiric high-dose steroid tx if no improvement on abx
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - check c. diff to rule out GI source
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] and azithro
   - continue to follow all cultures
   - monitor lactate
   - LFTs elev, pt at risk for acalcolous cholecyctitis -> order RUQ, hep
   panel
   - dental c/s for possible tooth infection
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend up.  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na
   18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy brown
   casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the setting of
   ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has pulmonary
renal
   syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this possible diagnosis.
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA neg.
   - Cr trending down (4.9 today), continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs re: starting dialysis
   - use Bicarb if needed per renal
   .
   #) Anemia:  differential broad and includes anemia of chronic disease,
   iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No
   hemoptysis to suggest DAH, however this is still a possibility.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).
   - Follow trend
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated. Had some hand shakiness and muscle
   twitches when hands were lifted up. Possibly secondary to uremia and
   metabolic acidosis
   - continue to follow, this is the least of her problems at this point
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

   Code status: Full (discussed with patient)
   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma who presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes infectious processes such as atypical pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia; non-infectious causes like pulmonary-renal syndromes, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and bronchoalveolar carcinoma; and aspiration pneumonitis. The patient also meets the criteria for sepsis, and potential sources of infection include pulmonary infection and gastrointestinal infection. She is at risk for acute renal failure, which is likely pre-renal in etiology. The anemia is most likely due to anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation. Her hyponatremia has resolved, and she is sedated in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, progression of sepsis, development of acute renal failure requiring dialysis, worsening of anemia, and potential complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo female with initial admission with hypoxemic respiratory failure
   now with persistent hypoxemia and respiratory failure.  She has had
   persistent hypotension and renal failure secondary to ATN.  Importantly
   she has had some decrease in creatinine, she has had decreased urine
   output.  We have had fixed PEEP requirement across past 24 hours.
   1)Respiratory Failure-She has persistent ventilator requirements and
   suggesetion of radiographic worsening.  We do have no evidence of
   infectious pathogen and do have limited evidence of recovery beyond
   initial improvements seen [**8-10**].  We have considere carefully and in
   discussion with thoracic surgery possible approaches to biopsy which
   represent procedure with thoracotomy and likely significant risk with
   BPF and air leak following procedure.  The respiratory failure is
   secondary to
   A)ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])-
   -Continue with lung protective strategy
   -Will look to minimize fluids as possible but do already see
   significnat bilateral pleural effusions
   -FIO2 and PEEP at acceptable level
   -Continue full support
   B)PNEUMONIA-have not had any evidence of positive culture results
   across bacterial and viral assays.  The clinical picture of high fevers
   and acute evolution of infiltrates is suggestive but the nature of
   infiltrates is atypical for any single pathogen
   -Meropenem/Azithromycin
   -Follow up viral cultures
   C)Pneumonitis-This is suggested given nature of infiltrates and concern
   for possible AIP/Hamman-[**Doctor First Name **].  She did not have any evidence of
   pulmonary hemorrhage on initial BAL.  We do not see evidence,
   therefore, for an acute vasculitic presentation.  The argument to move
   to empiric steroids would be based upon treatment of an idiopathic
   pneumonitis.
   -Will continue to monitor response to current antibiotics
   -Will continue with Meropenem and look to response by HD #7 given
   current clinical course
   -Will evaluate tooth as possible source of pathogen but this, as
   aspirated organism would have been expected to be seen on bronchoscopy
   2)Sepsis
   -Ongoing Rx with continued fevers seen
   -Will need evaluation of tooth lesion
   -Will need to consider intra-abdominal source with ultrasound
   -Continue with broad spectrum antibiotics
   -Wean levophed as possible
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Continue to support for ATN at this time
   -Do have improvement in creatinine from 5.3 and have an increase in
   urine output from yesterday into today.
   -IVF as needed for decrease in blood pressure

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with an initial admission of hypoxemic respiratory failure. She now presents with persistent hypoxemia and respiratory failure, persistent hypotension, and renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's condition is worsening despite supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent ventilator requirements and suggests worsening radiographic findings. There is no evidence of infectious pathogen, and there is limited evidence of recovery beyond initial improvements seen. The respiratory failure is likely secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, or pneumonitis.

2. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing fevers, and the source of infection needs to be evaluated. A possible intra-abdominal source should be considered with an ultrasound. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and levophed weaning should be considered as possible.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has shown improvement in creatinine from 5.3 and an increase in urine output. Support for ATN should continue, and IV fluids should be administered as needed for decreased blood pressure.

4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires ongoing management with IV fluids and vasopressor support.

5. Fever, Unknown Origin: The patient has persistent fevers of unknown origin, which may indicate an ongoing infection or sepsis.

6. Constipation: The patient is at risk for"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, continue current settings as pt did not tolerate
   other modes and settings well
   - continue meropenam and azithro as per ID
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u Vanc trough today and redose if needed
   - follow all cultures
   - will opt against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   - consider empiric high-dose steroid tx if no improvement on abx
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - check c. diff to rule out GI source
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] and azithro
   - continue to follow all cultures
   - monitor lactate
   - LFTs elev, pt at risk for acalcolous cholecyctitis -> order RUQ, hep
   panel
   - dental c/s for possible tooth infection
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend up.  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na
   18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy brown
   casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the setting of
   ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has pulmonary
renal
   syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this possible diagnosis.
   [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA neg.
   - Cr trending down (4.9 today), continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs re: starting dialysis
   - use Bicarb if needed per renal
   .
   #) Anemia:  differential broad and includes anemia of chronic disease,
   iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No
   hemoptysis to suggest DAH, however this is still a possibility.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).
   - Follow trend
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated. Had some hand shakiness and muscle
   twitches when hands were lifted up. Possibly secondary to uremia and
   metabolic acidosis
   - continue to follow, this is the least of her problems at this point
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma, presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. She is now intubated and undergoing mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The differential diagnosis includes ARDS, sepsis, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be attributed to ARDS, which is characterized by acute onset of shortness of breath and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray. The patient's lack of response to lasix suggests an atypical process such as an infectious agent like mycoplasma or viral process.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, and the source of infection appears to be pulmonary. Other potential sources include gastrointestinal tract but are less likely since the patient had no GI complaint on admission. Continuous monitoring of lactate levels and follow-up cultures are advised.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending upward, indicating renal impairment. The presence of muddy brown casts suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), possibly due to hypotension. Pulmonary-renal syndrome/vasculitis is also a possibility, especially with the presence of anemia. ANCA testing has come back negative.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be due to an"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, continue current settings as pt did not tolerate
   other modes and settings well
   - continue meropenam and azithro as per ID
   - f/u ID recs- ask if antifungal coverage is warranted
   - f/u Vanc trough today and redose if needed
   - follow all cultures
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   - will start high-dose steroid tx today since still no improvement-
   salumederol 1g daily x 3days (pt unlikely to have CHF as recent ECHo
   shows normal EF and good central venous O2 sats)
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - c. diff neg x1
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] and azithro as per ID
   - continue to follow all cultures

   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend down.  FeNa 0.36, Urine
   Na 18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy
   brown casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the
   setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has
   pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this
   possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA
   neg.
   - Cr trending down (4.9 today), continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs (no dialysis since Cr is improving
   .
   #) Anemia:  differential broad and includes anemia of chronic disease,
   iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No
   hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).
   - Follow trend
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated. Had some hand shakiness and muscle
   twitches when hands were lifted up. Possibly secondary to uremia and
   metabolic acidosis
   - pt is on very high doses of fentanyl and versed currently, with still
   dissynchronous breathing
   - will f/u pharm recs regarding other options for sedation
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and underwent bronchoscopy. Her chest x-ray shows persistent bilateral effusions and opacities, which are not consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). She did not respond to lasix, suggesting that CHF may not be the primary cause of her respiratory distress. 

The differential diagnosis for the patient's respiratory distress includes ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, and other infectious processes such as atypical pneumonia, viral infection, or inhalation injury. There is also consideration of pulmonary-renal syndromes/vasculitis due to muddy brown casts and anemia. The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, with acute onset, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200. 

The patient's sepsis criteria are also met, with suspected pulmonary infection as the source. Other sources of infection, such as gastrointestinal (GI) infections, have been ruled out as the patient had no GI complaints on admission. 

The patient's renal function is improving, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as the likely cause of acute renal failure. Anemia is also present and may be related to chronic disease or inflammation.

   Imaging: CXr-Patient with persistence of bilateral diffuse alveolar

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo female with admission with prodrome of fever and myalgia and now
   with evolving extensive pulmonary infiltrates with diffuse opacities,
   acute onset and severe hypoxemia all consistent wtih ARDS.  No evidence
   of alveolar hemorrhage is seen.  We do not have any meaningful trend
   back towards normal capacity for oxygenation and ventilation.  In this
   setting after a week of antibiotic therapy and will all possible
   sources of infection considered, including possible tooth infection we
   do not have an identified source or alternatve treatment option.  We
   have discussed with surgery the possibility of biopsy but this would
   involve thoracotomy and in their impression would represent increased
   risk out of proportion to possible benefit.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Acute( ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS,
   ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**]))
   -Will maintain PCV mode continuing
   -We have adequate support but incapacity to decrease FIO2 or maintain
   and stability of support
   -Will follow ABG
   -Will continue with PCV support
   -Will continue with broad spectrum antibiotics-_Azithro/Meropenem
   -Will look to culture results
   -Will move to hight dose steroids to look for response from possible
   primary distrubance of inflammation but with AIP/[**Last Name (un) 4350**]-[**Doctor First Name **] or in fact
   an organizing pneumonitis so will move to Solumdrol 250mg qid x 48
   hours
   -With reasonable CVP, preserved and elevated central venous sat
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema is unlikley at this time.
   2)Sepsis-
   -Continue with pressors
   -Look to titrate as possible today
   -Continue treatment for broad spectrum antibiotics
   3)Altered Mental Status-
   -Will move to Propofol for dosing
   -Will look to wean as possible current medications
   -Will consider Presidex if needed or Ketamine

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient presented with fever, myalgia, and extensive pulmonary infiltrates consistent with ARDS. Despite one week of antibiotic therapy, no meaningful improvement in oxygenation and ventilation has been observed. There is no identified source of infection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.7°F, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 111/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in PCV mode with a set respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 60%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.24, PaCO2 of 52 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 148.

The patient has a history of allergies to Simvastatin, Niacin, Sulfonamides, Penicillins, and Enalapril Maleate. She was last given antibiotics on 08/13/2159 at 01:45 AM (Levofloxacin), 09:20 PM (Aztreonam), and 11:45 PM (Meropenem). She was also given Azithromycin at 07:50 AM on 08/15/2159. The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.05 mcg/kg/min, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin.

The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 13.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 4.9 mg/dL, low platelet count of 228 K/uL, and elevated lactate level of 0.6 mmol/L. Imaging reveals bilateral diffuse alveolar infiltrates with mild sparing of the upper lobes.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1) Respiratory Failure due to ARDS, which will be managed by maintaining PCV mode ventilation and monitoring ABG results. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued, and culture results will be awaited. High-dose steroids may be considered for inflammation response.
2) Sepsis will be managed by continuing pressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3) Altered Mental Status will be managed by transitioning to propofol dosing, weaning current medications, and considering Presidio or Ketamine if needed.

ICU care includes nutrition support with Nutren Pulmonary, glycemic control, arterial and multi-lumen lines, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP precautions. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, continue current settings as pt did not tolerate
   other modes and settings well
   - continue steroids salumederol 1g daily x 3days
   - no antifungal per ID
   - continue meropenam and azithro as per ID
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u Vanc trough today and redose if needed
   - follow all cultures
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - c. diff neg x1
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] and azithro as per ID
   - continue to follow all cultures
   - monitor lactate
   - LFTs elev, RUQ rules out acute cholecystitis, hep panel is pending
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend down.  FeNa 0.36, Urine
   Na 18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy
   brown casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the
   setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has
   pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this
   possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA
   neg.
   - Cr trending down (4.9 today), continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs (no dialysis since Cr is improving
   .
   #) Anemia:  differential broad and includes anemia of chronic disease,
   iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No
   hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).
   - Follow trend
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated. Had some hand shakiness and muscle
   twitches when hands were lifted up. Possibly secondary to uremia and
   metabolic acidosis
   - pt is on very high doses of fentanyl and versed currently, with still
   dissynchronous breathing
   - will f/u pharm recs regarding other options for sedation
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, continue current settings as pt did not tolerate
   other modes and settings well
   - continue steroids salumederol 1g daily x 3days
   - no antifungal per ID
   - continue meropenam and azithro as per ID
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u Vanc trough today and redose if needed
   - follow all cultures
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - c. diff neg x1
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] and azithro as per ID
   - continue to follow all cultures
   - monitor lactate
   - LFTs elev, RUQ rules out acute cholecystitis, hep panel is pending
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend down.  FeNa 0.36, Urine
   Na 18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy
   brown casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the
   setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has
   pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this
   possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA
   neg.
   - Cr trending down (4.9 today), continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs (no dialysis since Cr is improving
   .
   #) Anemia:  differential broad and includes anemia of chronic disease,
   iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No
   hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).
   - Follow trend
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated. Had some hand shakiness and muscle
   twitches when hands were lifted up. Possibly secondary to uremia and
   metabolic acidosis
   - pt is on very high doses of fentanyl and versed currently, with still
   dissynchronous breathing
   - will f/u pharm recs regarding other options for sedation
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure, with a broad differential including infectious processes such as atypical pneumonia, viral infections, or inhalation injury. The patient does not meet the criteria for congestive heart failure (CHF) or drug overdose. 

In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, possible causes include aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury. There is no evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, transfusion-related issues, trauma, drowning, or burn. 

The patient also meets the criteria for sepsis, with a pulmonary infection being high on the differential. Other potential sources of infection include gastrointestinal (GI) sources, but the patient has no GI complaint on admission. 

Additionally, the patient is experiencing acute renal failure, with a trend of decreasing creatinine levels. The presence of muddy brown casts suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely secondary to hypotension. There is also concern for pulmonary-renal syndrome/vasculitis, but the patient has negative ANCA results. 

Furthermore, the patient has anemia with a broad differential including"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The differential diagnosis includes ARDS, sepsis, acute renal failure, hyperphosphatemia, anemia, hyponatremia, and mental status changes. The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are not consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). There are no known risk factors for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient's renal function is improving, but she has signs of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and pre-renal etiology. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, except for hyperphosphatemia. Anemia is present, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. The patient's mental status is altered due to sedation and possible uremia and metabolic acidosis. The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures are being managed appropriately in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by diffuse alveolar damage. It can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient"

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma who presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. She was intubated and bronchoscoped, and her chest x-ray showed persistent bilateral effusions and opacities. The differential for her respiratory distress includes ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure, infectious processes such as atypical pneumonia, viral process, and aspiration pneumonitis. She meets the criteria for ARDS and sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, resolved hyponatremia (possibly due to SIADH), and hyperphosphatemia. Her renal function is improving, but she has acute renal failure with muddy brown casts, likely due to hypotension and ATN. Her Cr is trending down, and she is producing urine with a FeNa of 0.36 and Urine Na of 18, which is consistent with a pre-renal etiology.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition via a pulmonary formula, glycemic control, arterial and multi-lumen lines for monitoring and medication administration, prophylactic heparin for DVT, IV PPI for stress ulcer prevention, and adherence to the VAP bundle. The patient's mental status is currently sedated, possibly secondary to uremia and metabolic acidosis.

Overall, the patient's medical complications include ARDS, sepsis, acute renal failure with possible ATN, hyperphosphatemia, and anemia of chronic disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, continue current settings as pt did not tolerate
   other modes and settings well
   - continue steroids salumederol 1g daily x 3days
   - no antifungal per ID
   - continue meropenam and azithro as per ID
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u Vanc trough today and redose if needed, yesterday 15.2
   - follow all cultures
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - c. diff neg x1
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] and azithro as per ID

   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend down.  FeNa 0.36, Urine
   Na 18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy
   brown casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the
   setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has
   pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this
   possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA
   neg.

   #) Anemia: Hct stable. differential broad and includes anemia of
   chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate
   normal. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
   - Guaiac stools

   .
   #) Hyponatremia: resolved. Differential is hypovolemic versus SIADH
   (likely from lung process).
   - Follow trend
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated. Had some hand shakiness and muscle
   twitches when hands were lifted up. Possibly secondary to uremia and
   metabolic acidosis
   - pt is on very high doses of fentanyl and versed currently, with still
   dissynchronous breathing
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. She has been intubated and undergone a bronchoscopy. The differential for her respiratory distress includes ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, and pulmonary infection. The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, with bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and PaO2/FiO2 <200. She also meets the criteria for sepsis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's symptoms of respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe lung dysfunction and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, respiratory distress, and meeting the criteria for sepsis indicate a potential systemic infection. Sepsis can lead to organ failure and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
3. Pulmonary Infection: Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, a pulmonary infection such as pneumonia is a possibility. It can be caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and urine output indicate a potential kidney injury. AKI can occur due to factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or the use of nephrotoxic medications.
5. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's elevated phosphate levels suggest hyperphosphatemia, which can occur in the setting of renal failure. This condition can lead to complications such as calcium-phosphate deposition and further renal damage.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which could include anemia of chronic disease or iron deficiency.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient previously had hyponatremia, which has since resolved. Monitoring of electrolyte levels is important to prevent any further imbalances.
8. Mental Status Changes: The patient is currently sedated and has had some neurological symptoms such as hand shakiness and muscle twitches. These symptoms could be related to uremia, metabolic acidosis, or the effects of sedative medications.

Please note that these are potential complications based on the information provided in the progress note. The actual medical complications may vary depending on the patient's condition and further evaluation."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo female with severe ARDS, Sepsis and renal failure.  This has been
   refractory to medical intervention to date with broad spectrum
   antibiotics trialed with ARDSnet strategy for support of respiratory
   failure.  This would suggest a significant primary insult as well from
   interstitial pneumonitis and after consideration of the risks of
   surgical approach have moved to empiric treatment with steroids given
   risks of thoracotomy in this setting and chance for non-diagnostic
   biopsy.
   Respiratory Failure-Patient with persistent and significant hypoxemic
   respiratory failure with desaturations even with re-positioning
   -Levoflox/Azithromycin/Meropenem
   -Methyprednisolone at 1 gram/d x 3 days
   -Follow culture results

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with severe ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), sepsis, and renal failure. She has been unresponsive to medical interventions, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and ARDSnet strategy for respiratory support. The primary insult may be interstitial pneumonitis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure control ventilation and is being treated with steroids, Levofloxacin, Azithromycin, and Methadone for sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure indicates a high risk of further deterioration and potential need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The mild decrease in creatinine suggests a possible plateau, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to assess kidney function and potential need for diuretics or continuous renal replacement therapy.
3. Sepsis: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient remains at risk for sepsis-related complications due to the unknown origin of fever and potential ongoing infection.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may require ongoing pressor support and careful monitoring to prevent shock.
5. Pulmonary Edema: The persistence of bilateral effusions on chest X-ray indicates ongoing pulmonary edema, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
6. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to immobilization and medications, which can"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, decrease PEEP to 10 and maitain driving pressure at
   18
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h, and continue to wean off
   fentanyl to reduce dyssynchronous breathing
   - wean down midazolam
   - continue steroids salumederol 1g daily x 3days (day3 today)
   - continue vanc, meropenam and azithro, and tamiflu as per ID
   - per ID, will check tularemia serologies, and will check
   nasopharyngeal swab and BAL-mini viral DFA and cultures
   - no antifungal per ID
   - follow all cultures
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   - f/u on anti-GBM
   - f/u anaplasma, babesia serologies, beta-glucan and galactomannan
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - continue vanc, [**Last Name (un) 614**] and azithro as per ID
   - continue to follow all cultures, c. diff neg x2
   - monitor lactate
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend down.  FeNa 0.36, Urine
   Na 18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy
   brown casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the
   setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has
   pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this
   possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA
   neg.
   - Cr trending down, continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs (no dialysis since Cr is improving)
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: in the setting of acute illness, concerning for
   acalculous cholecystitis. RUQ US only showed gallbladder sludge without
   evidence of cholecystitis
   - trend LFTs daily
   - will repeat RUQ US if LFT continues to rise
   .
   #) Hyperphosphatemia: Most likely [**12-25**] ARF.
   - continue aluminum hydroxide
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable. differential broad and includes anemia of
   chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate
   normal. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated.
   - wean down fentanyl and midazolam
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her chest X-ray shows persistent bilateral infiltrates, which are stable compared to yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing severe respiratory distress, and there is a broad differential for her respiratory symptoms. Possible causes include infectious processes such as atypical pneumonia, viral infection, or inhalational injury. Other potential causes include aspiration pneumonitis, rheumatologic processes, or pulmonary-renal syndromes.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, likely due to a pulmonary infection. However, gastrointestinal sources and skin breakdown are also possible but less likely in this case.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has a decreasing creatinine level, suggesting improvement in renal function. She has muddy brown casts, which are indicative of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) likely caused by hypotension. There is also a possibility of pulmonary-renal syndrome/vasculitis, but AN"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, continue current settings as pt did not tolerate
   other modes and settings well
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h, and continue to wean off
   fentanyl to reduce dyssynchronous breathing
   - continue steroids salumederol 1g daily x 3days (day3 today)
   - no antifungal per ID
   - continue vanc, meropenam and azithro as per ID
   - f/u Vanc trough today and redose if needed, yesterday 15.2
- f/u ID recs on Tamiflu dose. Per ID, given that her overall syndrome is consis
tent with influenza, reasonable to check nasopharyngeal swab and start tamiflu.
   - follow all cultures
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - continue vanc, [**Last Name (un) 614**] and azithro as per ID
   - continue to follow all cultures, c. diff neg x2
   - monitor lactate
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend down.  FeNa 0.36, Urine
   Na 18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy
   brown casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the
   setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has
   pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this
   possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA
   neg.
   - Cr trending down, continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs (no dialysis since Cr is improving)
   .
   #) Hyperphosphatemia: phos 7.1. [**12-25**] ARF.
   - continue aluminum hydroxide
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable. differential broad and includes anemia of
   chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate
   normal. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated. Had some hand shakiness and muscle
   twitches when hands were lifted up. Possibly secondary to uremia and
   metabolic acidosis
   - pt is on very high doses of fentanyl and versed currently, with still
   dissynchronous breathing
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone, change dose to 20mg Q4h
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma.
- She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure.
- She has been intubated and received a bronchoscopy.
- The differential for her respiratory distress includes ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, and pulmonary infection.
- She meets the criteria for ARDS due to acute onset, bilateral infiltrates on CXR, and PaO2/FiO2 <200.
- Possible precipitates of ARDS include aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury.
- The patient's chest x-ray does not completely match with CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected.
- Her fevers suggest an infectious process, and atypical organisms such as Legionella or Mycoplasma could be possibilities.
- Viral processes like varicella or CMV are also possible, but she has no known risk factors for PCP.
- Other considerations include rheumatologic processes, interstitial lung diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
- She meets the criteria for sepsis and her source of infection could be pulmonary or gastrointestinal.
- She has acute renal failure with muddy brown casts, indicating ATN.
- Her renal function is improving, and she is at risk for hyperphosphatemia due to ARF.
- She has anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, but no evidence of active bleeding or hemoptysis.
- Her mental status is currently sedated, and she exhibits hand shakiness and muscle twitches.
- She is on high doses of fentanyl and versed, causing dissynchronous breathing.
- Her ICU care includes nutrition support, arterial and multi-lumen lines, prophylaxis for DVT and VAP, and stress ulcer prevention.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - off pressors since 10AM
   - continued steroids
   - repeat CXR today: stable.  In comparison with study of [**8-15**],
   technical limitations most likely account for the apparent changes and
   increased haziness of the hemithoraces.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary
   opacifications persist
   - began phos binder: started aluminum hydroxide
   - still had vent dyssynchrony.  Per pharmacy, keep fentanyl as is,
   change methadone to 20 q4h (from q6h) and monitor for improvement
   before weaning fentanyl
   - [**Last Name (un) 614**], azithro continued
   - f/u ID recs: continue [**Last Name (un) 614**], azithro, vanco.  Nasopharyngeal swab may
   be unreliable due to lack of cells.  Tamiflu 75 [**Hospital1 7**] initiated.  Beta
   glucan and galactomannan ordered.
   - fu renal recs: Improving renal function, no need for emergent cvvh
   today.  Expect further post-ATN diuresis, so consider giving some D5W.
   Please start renagel 800mg TID for increased phos.
   - increased ISS due to steroids.

   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - currently on PC, continue current settings as pt did not tolerate
   other modes and settings well
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h, and continue to wean off
   fentanyl to reduce dyssynchronous breathing
   - continue steroids salumederol 1g daily x 3days (day3 today)
   - continue vanc, meropenam and azithro, and tamiflu as per ID
   - no antifungal per ID
   - follow all cultures
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.

   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend down.  FeNa 0.36, Urine
   Na 18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy
   brown casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the
   setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has
   pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this
   possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA

   #) Anemia: Hct stable. differential broad and includes anemia of
   chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate
   normal. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding

   twitches when hands were lifted up. Possibly secondary to uremia and
   metabolic acidosis
   - pt is on very high doses of fentanyl and versed currently, with still
   dissynchronous breathing
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone, change dose to 20mg Q4h
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and now has respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and bronchoscoped. She is currently on mechanical ventilation in pressure control mode. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, including acute onset, bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis. Pulmonary infection is high on the differential, and gastrointestinal sources are also possible but not reported by the patient.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has muddy brown casts, which suggest acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely due to hypotension. There is a possibility of pulmonary-renal syndrome/vasculitis, but ANCA is negative.
4. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has elevated phosphate levels, which could be due to ARF (acute renal failure).
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which could be due to anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. Iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease or"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo female with ARDS and ongoing support with recent intervention of
   high dose steroids for possible component of AIP/idopathic
   pneumonitis.  She has a worsening of effective ventilation and
   persistence of significant hypoxemia despite ongoing support and start
   of steroids Rx 2 days ago.  She does, however, have an improvement in
   sepsis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Fent 300, Versed 8, Methadone
   -Will continue with PCV
have trialed decrease in PEEP
will look to see
   improvement
   -Will check ABG
and titrate PEEP as indicated
if PCO2 is up and PO2 is
   down will up-titrate PEEP
   -Will minimize dead space in ventilatory circuit
   -Continue with PCV support today
   -Fluild bolus can be considered should PEEP titration prove ineffective
   2)Sepsis-
   -Meropenem/Azithro/Tamiflu all in place
   -Pressors off
   -Will continue with broad spectrum ABX
   3)Renal Failure-
   -Improving creatinine, improving urine flow over past 24 hours
   -Will continue with full support for perfusion
   -Encouraging that pressors are off

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and possible asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore
   throat, and now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks,
   however relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story. Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - continue on PC (PEEP of 10 and driving pressure of 18), will wean
   FiO2 to 50%
   - continue methadone 20mg Q4h, and continue to wean off fentanyl and
   midazolam
   - completed 3d of high-dose steroids salumederol (1g daily x 3days)
   - started Prednisone taper today
   - continue meropenam, azithro, and tamiflu as per ID
   - d/c azithro today as a 5d course is finished
   - changed [**Last Name (un) 614**] to 500 mg q12h now that renal function improved
   - f/u pendng cultures, studies
   - no antifungal per ID
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - pt is afebrile, normal WBC, off pressors
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**], azithro and tamiflu as per ID
   - continue to follow all cultures, c. diff neg x2
   - lactate normal
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend down.  FeNa 0.36, Urine
   Na 18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy
   brown casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the
   setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has
   pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this
   possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA
   neg.
   - Cr trending down, continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs (no dialysis since Cr is improving)
 d/c AlOH
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: in the setting of acute illness, concerning for
   acalculous cholecystitis.
   - RUQ US only showed gallbladder sludge without evidence of
   cholecystitis
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   #) Hyperphosphatemia: Most likely [**12-25**] ARF.
   - d/c aluminum hydroxide per renal rec
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable. differential broad and includes anemia of
   chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. iron studies are consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation, B12 and folate
   normal. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated.
   - wean down fentanyl and midazolam
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and now in respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and undergone bronchoscopy. The differential for the patient's respiratory distress is broad, including ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, and pulmonary infection.

The patient's chest x-ray does not completely align with congestive heart failure (CHF), and she did not respond to lasix as expected if CHF was the main issue. Her fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process, and given her chest x-ray, an atypical process such as Legionella or Mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral processes (such as varicella or CMV) are also possibilities. She has no known risk factors for PCP.

The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, with acute onset, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200, and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in the environment. There is no evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no history of transfusion, trauma, drowning, or burn. No history of drug overdose either.

The patient is being managed with PC (PEEP of 10 and driving pressure of 18), we"

   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and possible asthma who presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and now in respiratory failure. She has been intubated and bronchoscoped. The differential for the patient's respiratory distress includes ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure, infectious process (such as atypical pneumonia or viral process), rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, and aspiration pneumonitis.

The patient meets the criteria for ARDS as it is acute, with bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury. There is no evidence of CHF, pancreatitis, sepsis, transfusion, trauma, drowning, or burn. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 and driving pressure at 18.

The patient also has sepsis, with pulmonary infection being a possible source. No other sources of infection have been identified. The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics as per ID recs. Sepsis criteria include suspected or confirmed infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and organ dysfunction.

The patient has acute renal failure, likely"

   1)Respiratory Failure-
   *Blood gas slightly better  but soon to tell if this will be a
   sustained trend; continues to have high vent requirements
   *will decrease FiO2 to 0.5; consider decreasing PEEP if FiO2 wean
   tolerated

   -ID continuing to follow
   3)Renal Failure-
   attributed to hypotension/ATN- renal function returning with decreased

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore throat, and
   now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad, includes viral syndrome/ARDS, AIP, interstitial
   pneumonitis. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks, however
   relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story.  Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - continue on PC (PEEP of 10 and driving pressure of 18), weaned FiO2
   to 50% will recheck ABG
   - continue methadone 20mg Q4h, and continue to wean off fentanyl and
   midazolam
   - completed 3 day course of high-dose steroids salumederol (1g daily x
   3days)
   - started Prednisone taper yesterday
   - d/c azithro today as a 5d course is finished
   - changed [**Last Name (un) 614**] to 500 mg q12h (day 1: [**8-13**]) now that renal function
   improved
   - continue tamiflu
   - f/u extensive pendng cultures, scleroderma studies
   - no antifungal per ID
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - pt is afebrile, normal WBC, off pressors since [**8-16**]
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] and tamiflu as per ID
   - continue to follow all cultures, c. diff neg x2
   - lactate normal
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend down.  FeNa 0.36, Urine
   Na 18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy
   brown casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the
   setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has
   pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this
   possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA
   neg.
   - Cr trending down, continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs (no dialysis since Cr is improving)
 d/c AlOH
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: in the setting of acute illness, concerning for
   acalculous cholecystitis.
   - RUQ US only showed gallbladder sludge without evidence of
   cholecystitis
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   #) Hyperphosphatemia: Most likely [**12-25**] ARF.
   - d/c aluminum hydroxide per renal rec
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, s/p 2 units prbcs yesterday. differential broad
   and includes anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. iron
   studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia of
   inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated.
   - wean down fentanyl and midazolam
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated

   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and now in respiratory failure. She was intubated and bronchoscoped. Differential for the patient's respiratory distress includes viral syndrome/ARDS, acute interstitial pneumonitis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The patient meets the criteria for ARDS due to acute onset, bilateral infiltrates on CXR, and PaO2/FiO2 <200. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury. She was given high-dose steroids, and a prednisone taper was started.

The patient also meets the criteria for sepsis with pulmonary infection being a high source of infection. She had no GI complaints or skin breakdown. She is currently afebrile with a normal WBC count and off pressors since 08-16.

Acute renal failure is indicated by a continued trend of Cr down, FeNa 0.36, Urine Na 18, and muddy brown casts suggesting ATN in the setting of hypotension. There is a question of pulmonary renal syndrome/vasculitis, but ANCA is negative.

Elevated LFTs may be concerning for acalculous cholecystitis, but RUQ US only showed gallbladder sludge without evidence of cholecystitis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and is now in respiratory failure. The patient underwent intubation and bronchoscopy. 

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. ARDS/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient meets the criteria for ARDS due to acute onset of shortness of breath, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, with pulmonary infection being a high differential source. Other possible sources include gastrointestinal tract infection, but the patient had no GI complaint on admission. The patient is currently afebrile with normal WBC count and off pressors since August 16th.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a trend of decreasing creatinine levels, indicating improving renal function. The FeNa (fractional excretion of sodium) is 0.36 and Urine Na is 18, which are consistent with pre-renal etiology. The presence of muddy brown casts suggests acute tubular necrosis (ATN) likely due to hypotension. There is also a concern for pulmonary-"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore throat, and
   now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad, includes viral syndrome/ARDS, AIP, interstitial
   pneumonitis. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks, however
   relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story.  Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.

   discontinue
   - f/u extensive pendng cultures, scleroderma studies
   - no antifungal per ID
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. GI sources are also possible but pt had no GI complaint
   on admission. Pt has no skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.

   #) Acute renal failure: Cr continues to trend down.  FeNa 0.36, Urine
   Na 18, consistent with pre-renal etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy
   brown casts, most likely ATN in the setting of hypotension. In the
   setting of ARDS with bilateral infiltrate, question patient has
   pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis. Anemia is supportive of this
   possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is also supportive, however ANCA

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and asthma who presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and now in respiratory failure. She has been intubated and bronchoscoped. The differential diagnosis for the patient's respiratory distress includes viral syndrome/ARDS, acute interstitial pneumonitis (AIP), and pulmonary-renal syndromes. Other possible causes such as CHF, bacterial pneumonia, and drug overdose have been ruled out.

The patient meets the criteria for ARDS and sepsis. The sources of infection could be pulmonary or gastrointestinal, but the patient does not have any GI complaints. There is no evidence of skin breakdown to explain this sepsis.

The patient also has acute renal failure with a trend of decreasing creatinine levels, suggesting pre-renal etiology. The presence of muddy brown casts is consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension. There is a possibility of pulmonary-renal syndrome/vasculitis, but ANCA is negative.

The patient has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which may be due to acalculous cholecystitis or other causes. Hyperphosphatemia is likely secondary to acute renal failure, which has improved.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of discoid lupus, hypertension, and low back pain. She was admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, renal failure, fever of unknown origin, and constipation.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PC ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/52 mmHg to 158/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and she has received a total of 1,767 mL of fluids since admission.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as increased creatinine and lactate levels. Other lab results, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal ranges.

The patient's chest X-ray reveals diffuse bilateral infiltrates, which are unchanged from previous images. The assessment and plan include hyperglycemia, hyperphosphatemia, ARDS, hypotension, renal failure, fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and constipation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with acute respiratory failure. The specific etiology of her respiratory failure is unknown, but the differential includes viral syndrome/ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and AIP/interstitial pneumonitis. The patient's condition includes several medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require high levels of ventilatory support, and her blood gas is only slightly improved. It is planned to decrease FiO2 to 0.5 and consider decreasing PEEP if FiO2 wean is tolerated. The patient has been on high-dose steroids for three days and will be tapered over the next week.

2. Sepsis: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including meropenem, azithromycin, and tamiflu. The ID (Infectious Disease) team is continuing to follow the patient's sepsis.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is attributed to hypotension and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Her renal function is returning with decreased creatinine levels.

4. Autonomic Dysfunction Syndrome (AMS): It is difficult to evaluate further due to the patient's high sedation needs as she becomes quickly dyssynchronous with the ventilator.

The patient is also on methadone and fentanyl infusions for pain management and midazolam for sedation. There was an attempt to reduce the fentanyl/m"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore throat, and
   now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad, includes viral syndrome/ARDS, AIP, interstitial
   pneumonitis. She describes a prodrome lasting a few weeks, however
   relatively acute onset of shortness of breath today on day of
   presentation. Her chest x-ray is not completely consistent with a
   picture of just CHF, and she did not respond to lasix as expected if
   this was the whole story.  Her fevers are more suggestive of an
   infectious process; given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as
   legionella or mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral
   process (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no
   known risk factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be
   rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however
   renal function is WNL), institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP,
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis
   to suggest DAH, and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic
   blood color or alveolar bleeding.  Patient meets the criteria for ARDS
   as it is acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR. In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be
   aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in
   the environment. No evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o
   transfusion, trauma, drown, or burn. No h/o drug overdose either.
   - continue on PC (PEEP of 10 and driving pressure of 12), weaned FiO2
   to 50%, ABG shows compensated respiratory acidosis; continue high RR of
   30
   - continue methadone 20mg Q4h, and continue to wean off fentanyl and
   midazolam
   - completed 3 day course of high-dose steroids salumederol (1g daily x
   3days) for possible rheumatologic/vasculitis etiology
   - started Prednisone taper yesterday
   - d/c azithro today as a 5d course is finished
   - changed [**Last Name (un) 614**] to 500 mg q12h (day 1: [**8-13**]) now that renal function
   improved
   - continue tamiflu; if viral culture negative for 72 hours, plan to
   discontinue
   - f/u extensive pendng cultures, scleroderma studies
   - no antifungal per ID
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. Concening as white count elevated GI sources are also
   possible but pt had no GI complaint on admission. Pt has no skin
   breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - pt is afebrile, Eleveated WBC today to 12, off pressors since [**8-16**]
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] and tamiflu as per ID
   - continue to follow all cultures, c. diff neg x2; #3 pending
   - lactate normal
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) hypernatremia: Free water deficit: 3.875 L provide 250cc free water
   bolus q6h.  Obtain urine lytes today.
   #) Acute renal failure: Improving Cr continues to trend down 1.4 today
   (baseline 1.0).  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na 18, consistent with pre-renal
   etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy brown casts, most likely ATN in the
   setting of hypotension. In the setting of ARDS with bilateral
   infiltrate, question patient has pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis.
   Anemia is supportive of this possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is
   also supportive, however ANCA neg.
   - Cr trending down, continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs (no dialysis since Cr is improving)
 d/c AlOH
   .
   #) h/o Elevated LFTs: in the setting of acute illness, concerning for
   acalculous cholecystitis, now resolved
   - RUQ US only showed gallbladder sludge without evidence of
   cholecystitis
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   #) Hyperphosphatemia: Most likely [**12-25**] ARF.  Improved.
   - d/c aluminum hydroxide per renal rec
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, s/p 2 units prbcs [**8-18**]. differential broad and
   includes anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. iron studies
   are consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia of
   inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated.
   - wean down fentanyl and midazolam
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated
   .

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and asthma who presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and is now in respiratory failure. The patient underwent intubation and bronchoscopy. The differential diagnosis for the patient's respiratory distress includes viral syndrome/ARDS, acute interstitial pneumonia, and congestive heart failure (CHF). However, the chest X-ray is not completely consistent with CHF, and the patient did not respond to lasix as expected if this was the whole story.

The patient's fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process; given her chest X-ray, an atypical process such as Legionella or Mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral processes (such as varicella or cytomegalovirus) are also possibilities. The patient has no known risk factors for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Other considerations include rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes), interstitial lung diseases (UIP/AIP/DIP), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No evidence of hemoptysis to suggest diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and suctions from the endotracheal tube and bronchoscopy showed no rust-colored blood or alveolar bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female with history of hypertension,
   glaucoma, and asthma who came with subjective fevers, sore throat, and
   now in respiratory failure.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt is now s/p intubation and
   bronchoscopy. Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this
   time remains broad, includes viral syndrome/ARDS, AIP, interstitial
   pneumonitis. Her fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process;
   given her chest x-ray an atypical process such as legionella or
   mycoplasma would be higher on the differential. Viral process (such as
   varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. She has no known risk
   factors for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] considerations would be rheumatologic processes
   (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL),
   institial lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar carcinoma. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH,
   and suctions from ETT and bronchoscopy showed no rustic blood color or
   alveolar bleeding.
    Patient meets the criteria for ARDS as it is acute, no evidence of
   CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral infiltrates on CXR. Given her
   unresponsiveness to steroids, AIP is a high possibility at this time.
   In terms of the precipitate of ARDS, could be aspiration pneumonitis,
   viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation in the environment. No
   evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no h/o transfusion, trauma, drown, or
   burn.
   - continue on PC (PEEP of 10 and driving pressure of 12), weaned FiO2
   to 50%, ABG shows compensated respiratory acidosis; continue high RR of
   30; Decrease PEEP to 8 today
   - continue methadone 20mg Q4h, Start vailium 5 mg IV q 6 hours and and
   attempt to wean off fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - completed 3 day course of high-dose steroids salumederol (1g daily x
   3days) for possible rheumatologic/vasculitis etiology
   - started Prednisone taper [**8-18**]
   - d/c azithro [**8-19**] as a 5d course is finished
   - changed [**Last Name (un) 614**] to 500 mg q12h (day 1: [**8-13**]) now that renal function
   improved; d/c per ID recs
   - Stop tamiflu as  viral culture had been negative for 72 hours
   - f/u extensive pending cultures, scleroderma studies
   - no antifungal per ID
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. Concening as white count elevated GI sources are also
   possible but pt had no GI complaint on admission. Pt has no skin
   breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - pt with low grade temps to 100, Elevated WBC today to 12, off
   pressors since [**8-16**]
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] and tamiflu as per ID
   - continue to follow all cultures, c. diff neg x2; #3 pending
   - lactate normal
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Free water deficit: 3.875 L provide
   -   250cc free water bolus q3h and
   -  Start 100 cc/hr of D5W for 1000 mL
   -  Obtain urine lytes today.
   #) Acute renal failure: Improving Cr continues to trend down 1.4 today
   (baseline 1.0).  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na 18, consistent with pre-renal
   etiology. Per renal, pt has muddy brown casts, most likely ATN in the
   setting of hypotension. In the setting of ARDS with bilateral
   infiltrate, question patient has pulmonary
renal syndrome/vasculitis.
   Anemia is supportive of this possible diagnosis. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10093**] is
   also supportive, however ANCA neg.
   - Cr trending down, continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs (no dialysis since Cr is improving)
 d/c AlOH
   .
   #) h/o Elevated LFTs: in the setting of acute illness, concerning for
   acalculous cholecystitis, now resolved
   - RUQ US only showed gallbladder sludge without evidence of
   cholecystitis
   - trend LFTs daily
   .
   #) Hyperphosphatemia: Most likely [**12-25**] ARF.  Improved.
   - d/c aluminum hydroxide per renal rec
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, s/p 2 units prbcs [**8-18**]. Differential broad and
   includes anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, etc. iron studies
   are consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia of
   inflammation, B12 and folate normal. No hemoptysis to suggest DAH.
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated.
   - wean down fentanyl and midazolam
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h
   - Start diazepam 5 mg IV q 6 hours
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated
   .
   # Decreased bowel movements: Concern for narcotic induced ileus
   -  Add lactulose today PO standing
   -  Consider PO Narcan and/or another lactulose enema if no improvement

   Code status: Full (discussed with patient)
   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient's medical history includes hypertension, glaucoma, and asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a diagnosis of ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure. The differential for her respiratory distress includes viral syndrome/ARDS, acute interstitial pneumonitis (AIP), and other atypical pneumonia. The chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates, which are more suggestive of an infectious process such as Legionella or Mycoplasma. Viral processes like varicella or CMV are also possible.

The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, which is acute, with no evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF), and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200. She has bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray. Given her unresponsiveness to steroids, AIP is a high possibility. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury. There is no evidence of pancreatitis, sepsis, no history of transfusion, trauma, drowning, or burn.

The patient's current medications include methadone 20mg IV q4h, fentanyl decreased from 150 to 125 mcg/hr, midazolam decreased from 5 to 4 mg/hr, pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. The patient has been on a 3-day course of high-dose steroids for possible rheumatologic/vasculitis etiology and has been started on prednisone taper.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2 C (98.9 F)
- Heart rate: 67 bpm
- Blood pressure: 149/68 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 94%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals a right pupil that constricts to light, a left pupil with a cataract and no response to light, scattered rhonchi on lung auscultation, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, Foley catheter in place, and mild bilateral edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glaucoma, and asthma. She presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. She was intubated and underwent bronchoscopy. The differential for her respiratory distress includes viral syndrome/ARDS, acute interstitial pneumonitis, and aspiration pneumonitis. Her chest x-ray is not consistent with congestive heart failure, and she did not respond to lasix as expected. She has no known risk factors for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, which is acute, with no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200, and bilateral infiltrates on CXR. The precipitate of ARDS could be aspiration pneumonitis, viral or atypical pneumonia, or inhalation injury. She has no history of pancreatitis, sepsis, transfusion, trauma, drowning, or burn. She is currently on PC (PEEP of 10 and driving pressure of 18), weaned FiO2 to 50%, and her ABG will be rechecked.

Other assessments and plans include sepsis, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), hyperphosphatemia, hypernatremia, anemia, mental status changes, and decreased bowel movements. The patient's renal function is improving, and she is off pressors since [**8"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female who came with subjective fevers,
   sore throat, and now in respiratory failure. ARDS of unclear etiology,
   nonresponsive to steroids and overall minimal change from day prior.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure Intubated on PCV/PSV.
   Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this time remains
   broad, includes viral syndrome/ARDS, AIP, interstitial pneumonitis. Her
   fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process;. Viral process
   (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. Other
   considerations would be rheumatologic processes (vasculitis,
   pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL), institial
   lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Patient meets the criteria for ARDS as it is
   acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR.
   - continue on PC; FiO2 to 50%, ABG; continue to taper vent settings as
   tolerated.
   - continue methadone 20mg Q4h, Valium 5 mg IV q 6 hours and and attempt
   to wean off fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - completed 3 day course of high-dose steroids salumederol (1g daily x
   3days) for possible rheumatologic/vasculitis etiology
   - Continue Prednisone taper (started [**8-18**])
   - d/c azithro [**8-19**] as a 5d course is finished
   - changed [**Last Name (un) 614**] to 500 mg q12h (day 1: [**8-13**]) now that renal function
   improved
   - Stop tamiflu as  viral culture had been negative for 72 hours
   - f/u extensive pending cultures, scleroderma studies
   - no antifungal per ID
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential. Concening as white count elevated GI sources are also
   possible but pt had no GI complaint on admission. Pt has no skin
   breakdown to explain this sepsis.
   - pt with low grade temps to 100,  WBC continuing to climb today to
   16.5, off pressors since [**8-16**]
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] as per ID
   - continue to follow all cultures, c. diff neg x2; #3 pending
   - lactate normal
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Free water deficit:  4.1 Liters after 250 cc free
   water boluses q 3 hours and 100 cc/hr of D5W for 1000 mL
   -   300 cc free water bolus q3h per renal
   -   100 cc/hr of D5W for 24 hours per renal
   -  Change all medications to D5W medium as can be accomplished; spoke
   with Rx and will make adjustments as needed
   #) Acute renal failure: Improved Cr continues to trend down 0.9 today
   (baseline 1.0).  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na 18, consistent with pre-renal
   etiology and with  muddy brown casts, ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.
   - Cr at baseline and BUN trending down, continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - f/u anti-GBM
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: slowly increasing; in the setting of acute illness,
   concerning for acalculous cholecystitis,
   - RUQ US only showed gallbladder sludge without evidence of
   cholecystitis
   - trend LFTs daily
   ..
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, s/p 2 units prbcs [**8-18**]. Iron studies are
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation,
   B12 and folate normal.
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated.
   - wean down fentanyl and midazolam
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h
   - Continue diazepam 5 mg IV q 6 hours
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated
   .
   # Decreased bowel movements: Concern for narcotic induced ileus;
   although standing lactulose has generated large bowel movements

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female who came with subjective fevers,
   sore throat, and now in respiratory failure. ARDS of unclear etiology,
   nonresponsive to steroids and overall minimal change from day prior.
   .
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure Intubated on PCV/PSV.
   Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this time remains
   broad, includes viral syndrome/ARDS, AIP, interstitial pneumonitis. Her
   fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process;. Viral process
   (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. Other
   considerations would be rheumatologic processes (vasculitis,
   pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL), institial
   lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Patient meets the criteria for ARDS as it is
   acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR.
   - continue on PC; FiO2 to 50%, ABG; continue to taper vent settings as
   tolerated.
   - continue methadone 20mg Q4h, Valium 5 mg IV q 6 hours and and attempt
   to wean off fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - completed 3 day course of high-dose steroids salumederol (1g daily x
   3days) for possible rheumatologic/vasculitis etiology
   - Continue Prednisone taper (started [**8-18**])
   - d/c azithro [**8-19**] as a 5d course is finished
   - changed [**Last Name (un) 614**] to 500 mg q12h (day 1: [**8-13**]) now that renal function
   improved stop [**8-23**]^st .
   - Stop tamiflu as  viral culture had been negative for 72 hours
   - f/u extensive pending cultures, scleroderma studies
   - no antifungal per ID
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential.
   - pt with low grade temps to 100,  WBC continuing to climb today to
   16.5, off pressors since [**8-16**]
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] as per ID and stop [**8-23**].
   - continue to follow all cultures, c. diff neg x2
   - lactate normal
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Free water deficit:  4.1 Liters after 250 cc free
   water boluses q 3 hours and 100 cc/hr of D5W for 1000 mL
   -   500 cc free water bolus q3h per renal
   -   100 cc/hr of D5W for 24 hours per renal
   -  Change all medications to D5W medium as can be accomplished; spoke
   with Rx and will make adjustments as needed
   #) Acute renal failure: Improved Cr continues to trend down 0.9 today
   (baseline 1.0).  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na 18, consistent with pre-renal
   etiology and with  muddy brown casts, ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.
   - Cr at baseline and BUN trending down, continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - anti-GBM negative
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: slowly increasing; in the setting of acute illness,
   concerning for acalculous cholecystitis,
   - RUQ US only showed gallbladder sludge without evidence of
   cholecystitis
   - trend LFTs daily
   ..
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, s/p 2 units prbcs [**8-18**]. Iron studies are
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation,
   B12 and folate normal.
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated.
   - wean down fentanyl and midazolam
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h
   - Continue diazepam 5 mg IV q 6 hours
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated
   .
   # Decreased bowel movements: Concern for narcotic induced ileus;
   although standing lactulose has generated large bowel movements
   -          Change lactulose today PO to PRN
   -          Send off C.diff

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female admitted with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with ARDS of unclear etiology, nonresponsive to steroids, and minimal change from the previous day. The patient is intubated on PCV/PSV and meets the criteria for ARDS. She also has hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is due to ARDS, which is of unclear etiology. She is currently on PCV/PSV and FiO2 at 50%. Vent settings are being tapered as tolerated.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis. Pulmonary infection is high on the differential, and she has an elevated WBC count. Cultures are pending, and she is being treated with appropriate antibiotics.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a free water deficit of 4.1 liters and is receiving D5W boluses every three hours. Medications are being changed to D5W medium.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine is trending down, indicating improvement. She has muddy brown casts and a FeNa of 0.36, consistent with pre-renal etiology, possibly acute tubular necrosis due to hypotension.
5. Elevated LFTs: The patient's liver function tests are slowly increasing"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. This can lead to difficulty breathing and inadequate oxygenation.

2. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient's serum sodium level is elevated, indicating hypernatremia. This can result in dehydration and neurological symptoms if not corrected promptly.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently high, indicating hyperglycemia. This can increase the risk of infections and complications related to poor wound healing.

4. Hyperphosphatemia (High Phosphate): The patient's phosphate levels are elevated, which may indicate impaired renal function. Elevated phosphate levels can contribute to various complications, including bone demineralization and cardiac dysfunction.

5. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. ARF can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased risk of infection, and other systemic complications.

6. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has an unexplained fever, which can be indicative of an underlying infection or inflammatory process. It is important to investigate and treat the underlying cause to prevent further complications.

7. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female who came with subjective fevers,
   sore throat, and now in respiratory failure. ARDS of unclear etiology,
   nonresponsive to steroids and overall minimal change from day prior.
   .
   #Goals of Care: After family meeting, it was decided to extubate
   patient as patient
s wishes were to not have a trach.
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure Intubated on PCV/PSV.
   Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this time remains
   broad, includes viral syndrome/ARDS, AIP, interstitial pneumonitis. Her
   fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process;. Viral process
   (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. Other
   considerations would be rheumatologic processes (vasculitis,
   pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL), institial
   lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Patient meets the criteria for ARDS as it is
   acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR.
   - continue on PC; FiO2 to 50%, ABG; continue to taper vent settings as
   tolerated.
   - continue methadone 20mg Q4h, Valium 5 mg IV q 6 hours and and attempt
   to wean off fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - completed 3 day course of high-dose steroids salumederol (1g daily x
   3days) for possible rheumatologic/vasculitis etiology
   - Continue Prednisone taper (started [**8-18**])
   - d/c azithro [**8-19**] as a 5d course is finished
   - changed [**Last Name (un) 614**] to 500 mg q12h (day 1: [**8-13**]) now that renal function
   improved stop [**8-23**]^st .
   - Stop tamiflu as  viral culture had been negative for 72 hours
   - f/u extensive pending cultures, scleroderma studies
   - no antifungal per ID
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential.
   - pt with low grade temps to 100,  WBC continuing to climb today to
   16.5, off pressors since [**8-16**]
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] as per ID and stop [**8-23**].
   - continue to follow all cultures, c. diff neg x2
   - lactate normal
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Free water deficit:  4.1 Liters after 250 cc free
   water boluses q 3 hours and 100 cc/hr of D5W for 1000 mL
   -   500 cc free water bolus q3h per renal
   -   100 cc/hr of D5W for 24 hours per renal
   -  Change all medications to D5W medium as can be accomplished; spoke
   with Rx and will make adjustments as needed
   #) Acute renal failure: Improved Cr continues to trend down 0.9 today
   (baseline 1.0).  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na 18, consistent with pre-renal
   etiology and with  muddy brown casts, ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.
   - Cr at baseline and BUN trending down, continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - anti-GBM negative
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: slowly increasing; in the setting of acute illness,
   concerning for acalculous cholecystitis,
   - RUQ US only showed gallbladder sludge without evidence of
   cholecystitis
   - trend LFTs daily
   ..
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, s/p 2 units prbcs [**8-18**]. Iron studies are
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation,
   B12 and folate normal.
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated.
   - wean down fentanyl and midazolam
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h
   - Continue diazepam 5 mg IV q 6 hours
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated
   .
   # Decreased bowel movements: Concern for narcotic induced ileus;
   although standing lactulose has generated large bowel movements
   -          Change lactulose today PO to PRN
   -          Send off C.diff

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female who came with subjective fevers,
   sore throat, and now in respiratory failure. ARDS of unclear etiology,
   nonresponsive to steroids and overall minimal change from day prior.
   .
   #Goals of Care: After family meeting, it was decided to extubate
   patient as patient
s wishes were to not have a trach.
   -          d/c meds
   -          start morphine
   -          contact social work
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure Intubated on PCV/PSV.
   Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this time remains
   broad, includes viral syndrome/ARDS, AIP, interstitial pneumonitis. Her
   fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process;. Viral process
   (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. Other
   considerations would be rheumatologic processes (vasculitis,
   pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL), institial
   lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Patient meets the criteria for ARDS as it is
   acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR.
   - continue on PC; FiO2 to 50%, ABG; continue to taper vent settings as
   tolerated.
   - continue methadone 20mg Q4h, Valium 5 mg IV q 6 hours and and attempt
   to wean off fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - completed 3 day course of high-dose steroids salumederol (1g daily x
   3days) for possible rheumatologic/vasculitis etiology
   - Continue Prednisone taper (started [**8-18**])
   - d/c azithro [**8-19**] as a 5d course is finished
   - changed [**Last Name (un) 614**] to 500 mg q12h (day 1: [**8-13**]) now that renal function
   improved stop [**8-23**]^st .
   - Stop tamiflu as  viral culture had been negative for 72 hours
   - f/u extensive pending cultures, scleroderma studies
   - no antifungal per ID
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential.
   - pt with low grade temps to 100,  WBC continuing to climb today to
   16.5, off pressors since [**8-16**]
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] as per ID and stop [**8-23**].
   - continue to follow all cultures, c. diff neg x2
   - lactate normal
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Free water deficit:  4.1 Liters after 250 cc free
   water boluses q 3 hours and 100 cc/hr of D5W for 1000 mL
   -   500 cc free water bolus q3h per renal
   -   100 cc/hr of D5W for 24 hours per renal
   -  Change all medications to D5W medium as can be accomplished; spoke
   with Rx and will make adjustments as needed
   #) Acute renal failure: Improved Cr continues to trend down 0.9 today
   (baseline 1.0).  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na 18, consistent with pre-renal
   etiology and with  muddy brown casts, ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.
   - Cr at baseline and BUN trending down, continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - anti-GBM negative
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: slowly increasing; in the setting of acute illness,
   concerning for acalculous cholecystitis,
   - RUQ US only showed gallbladder sludge without evidence of
   cholecystitis
   - trend LFTs daily
   ..
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, s/p 2 units prbcs [**8-18**]. Iron studies are
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation,
   B12 and folate normal.
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated.
   - wean down fentanyl and midazolam
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h
   - Continue diazepam 5 mg IV q 6 hours
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated
   .
   # Decreased bowel movements: Concern for narcotic induced ileus;
   although standing lactulose has generated large bowel movements
   -          Change lactulose today PO to PRN
   -          Send off C.diff

   Disposition: Extubate today and stay in ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female admitted with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) of unclear etiology, nonresponsive to steroids, and minimal change from the previous day. The patient's wishes are to avoid tracheostomy, so extubation is planned for today.

The patient's respiratory distress differential includes viral syndrome/ARDS, Acute Interstitial Pneumonitis (AIP), interstitial pneumonitis, and other possibilities such as rheumatologic processes (vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndromes), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and bronchoalveolar carcinoma. The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, which is acute, with no evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF), PaO2/FiO2 <200, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.

The patient also has sepsis, with low-grade temperatures to 100, WBC continuing to climb, and off pressors since August 16th. The source of infection is suspected to be pulmonary infection. The patient is being treated with [Last Name (un) 614] as per ID and will stop on August 23rd. Cultures and c. diff status will be followed.

Hypernatremia is present, with a free water deficit of 4.1 liters. The patient has received 250 cc"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 10054**] is a 70 year old female who came with subjective fevers,
   sore throat, and now in respiratory failure. ARDS of unclear etiology,
   nonresponsive to steroids and overall minimal change from day prior.
   .
   #Goals of Care: After family meeting, it was decided to extubate
   patient as patient
s wishes were to not have a trach.
   #) ARDS/hypercarbic respiratory failure Intubated on PCV/PSV.
   Differential for patient's respiratory distress at this time remains
   broad, includes viral syndrome/ARDS, AIP, interstitial pneumonitis. Her
   fevers are more suggestive of an infectious process;. Viral process
   (such as varicella, CMV) would also be possibilties. Other
   considerations would be rheumatologic processes (vasculitis,
   pulmonary-renal syndromes, however renal function is WNL), institial
   lung diseases such as UIP/AIP/DIP, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,
   bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Patient meets the criteria for ARDS as it is
   acute, no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200 and pt has bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR.
   - continue on PC; FiO2 to 50%, ABG; continue to taper vent settings as
   tolerated.
   - continue methadone 20mg Q4h, Valium 5 mg IV q 6 hours and and attempt
   to wean off fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated
   - completed 3 day course of high-dose steroids salumederol (1g daily x
   3days) for possible rheumatologic/vasculitis etiology
   - Continue Prednisone taper (started [**8-18**])
   - d/c azithro [**8-19**] as a 5d course is finished
   - changed [**Last Name (un) 614**] to 500 mg q12h (day 1: [**8-13**]) now that renal function
   improved stop [**8-23**]^st .
   - Stop tamiflu as  viral culture had been negative for 72 hours
   - f/u extensive pending cultures, scleroderma studies
   - no antifungal per ID
   - opted against lung bx for now as risk too high with thorocotomy
   .
   #) Sepsis: Patient meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the
   sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the
   differential.
   - pt with low grade temps to 100,  WBC continuing to climb today to
   16.5, off pressors since [**8-16**]
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 614**] as per ID and stop [**8-23**].
   - continue to follow all cultures, c. diff neg x2
   - lactate normal
   - dental rec tooth extractionas outpt, pt unable to have panorex
   currently
   - maintain MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr and ScvO2 > 70%
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Free water deficit:  4.1 Liters after 250 cc free
   water boluses q 3 hours and 100 cc/hr of D5W for 1000 mL
   -   500 cc free water bolus q3h per renal
   -   100 cc/hr of D5W for 24 hours per renal
   -  Change all medications to D5W medium as can be accomplished; spoke
   with Rx and will make adjustments as needed
   #) Acute renal failure: Improved Cr continues to trend down 0.9 today
   (baseline 1.0).  FeNa 0.36, Urine Na 18, consistent with pre-renal
   etiology and with  muddy brown casts, ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.
   - Cr at baseline and BUN trending down, continue to monitor
   - maintain renal perfusion by MAP>65, CVP>[**9-3**], UOP>30cc/hr
   - anti-GBM negative
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: slowly increasing; in the setting of acute illness,
   concerning for acalculous cholecystitis,
   - RUQ US only showed gallbladder sludge without evidence of
   cholecystitis
   - trend LFTs daily
   ..
   #) Anemia: Hct stable, s/p 2 units prbcs [**8-18**]. Iron studies are
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease or anemia of inflammation,
   B12 and folate normal.
   - Transfusion threshold <21 or evidence of active bleeding
   .
   # Mental Status: currently sedated.
   - wean down fentanyl and midazolam
   - per pharmacy, continue methadone 20mg Q4h
   - Continue diazepam 5 mg IV q 6 hours
   - can re-assess neuro status when pt is less sedated
   .
   # Decreased bowel movements: Concern for narcotic induced ileus;
   although standing lactulose has generated large bowel movements
   -          Change lactulose today PO to PRN
   -          Send off C.diff

   Disposition: Extubate today and stay in ICU for now
","The patient is a 70-year-old female who presented with subjective fevers, sore throat, and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with ARDS of unclear etiology, nonresponsive to steroids, and overall minimal change from the previous day. The patient's wishes are to not have a tracheostomy.

The goals of care include extubation as the patient's respiratory distress remains broad, including viral syndrome/ARDS, acute interstitial pneumonitis, and other possibilities such as rheumatologic processes, pulmonary-renal syndromes, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or bronchoalveolar carcinoma. The patient meets the criteria for ARDS, which is acute, with no evidence of CHF, PaO2/FiO2 <200, and bilateral infiltrates on CXR.

The assessment and plan include continuing on PC with FiO2 to 50%, ABG, tapering vent settings as tolerated, and attempting to wean off fentanyl and midazolam as tolerated. The patient has completed a 3-day course of high-dose steroids for a possible rheumatologic/vasculitis etiology, and Prednisone taper has been started. Azithromycin was discontinued as a 5-day course is finished. Vancomycin was changed to 500 mg q12h (day 1: [8-13]) now that renal function improved. Tamiflu was stopped as the viral culture had been negative for 72 hours. Extensive pending cultures, scleroderma studies, and no antifungal per ID were opted against. Lung biopsy was also not performed due to the high risk associated with thoracotomy.

The patient also meets the criteria for sepsis. In terms of the sources of infection, pulmonary infection is certainly high on the differential. The patient has low-grade temperatures, a climbing WBC count, and has been off pressors since [8-16]. Vancomycin was continued as per ID and stopped on [8-23]. All cultures, including C. diff, were negative, and lactate levels were normal. Dental records showed tooth extraction as outpatient, but the patient is unable to have a panorex currently. MAP >65, CVP >[9-3], UOP >30cc/hr, and ScvO2 >70% were maintained.

The patient also has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of 4.1 liters. She received 250 cc free water boluses q3h and 100 cc/hr of D5W for 1000 mL. Medications were changed to D5W medium as can be accomplished, and adjustments were made accordingly.

Acute renal failure has improved, with creatinine trending down to 0.9 today (baseline 1.0). FeNa 0.36, Urine Na 18, consistent with pre-renal etiology and with muddy brown casts, ATN in the setting of hyp"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male who remains on mechanical ventilation in the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to ARDS, pneumonia, and hypernatremia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 164/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's allergies include sulfonamides, penicillins, and niacin.

The patient's laboratory values show elevated sodium levels (143 mEq/L), glucose levels (194 mg/dL), and phosphate levels (4.7 mg/dL). The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 16.5 K/uL, and platelet count is within normal range at 394 K/uL. Other lab results including creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver function tests, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's respiratory status has shown marginal improvement with the ability to tolerate lower levels of PEEP. However, the family has decided to shift priorities to comfort measures rather than pursuing aggressive treatment options such as tracheostomy and continued mechanical ventilation. Social work has been notified, and the plan is to extubate the patient after the family arrives.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (due to prolonged"
