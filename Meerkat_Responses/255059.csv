","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia, who presented with severe left main coronary artery disease. The patient is currently being medically managed and is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on Monday. Preoperative evaluation is ongoing, and the patient is free of chest pain while on nitroglycerin and heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she has no signs of congestive heart failure. She is euvolemic and her fluid balance is within normal limits. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's severe left main coronary artery disease, there is a risk of cardiac complications during and after CABG surgery, such as arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, or heart failure.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient is currently on heparin, an anticoagulant, which increases the risk of bleeding. Careful monitoring of coagulation parameters is essential to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the invasive nature of the surgery and the presence of indwelling lines and catheters.
4. Respiratory complications: Postoperative respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or atelectasis, can occur due to immobility and decreased lung expansion.
5. Renal complications: The patient's preoperative renal function should be closely monitored, as there may be a risk of acute"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia. She presented with severe left main coronary artery disease, which was confirmed through catheterization. The patient is currently being medically managed and is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery on Monday. Her preoperative evaluation is underway, and she has already undergone some tests, including an X-ray, Panorex, type and screen, and urinalysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's severe left main coronary artery disease and planned CABG surgery, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
2. Bleeding Complications: The patient is currently receiving IV heparin, which carries a risk of bleeding. There is also a recommendation to hold Plavix pending CABG, as it increases the risk of bleeding during surgery.
3. Infection: The patient is on prophylactic antibiotics for stress ulcers and has a central line, which increases the risk of infection.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on supplemental oxygen and has an ABG showing low oxygen levels, indicating possible respiratory compromise.
5. Thrombotic Complications: Despite being on heparin, there is still a risk of thrombosis due to the severity of the coronary artery disease.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of hyperlipidemia who presents with severe left main coronary artery disease. She is currently being medically managed and is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C (99.1 F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/56 to 150/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems. 

Laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. The troponin T level is within normal range at 0.43. 

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including simvastatin, diltiazem, estradiol, furosemide, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and fluoxetine. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's history of severe left main coronary artery disease and upcoming CABG surgery puts her at risk for cardiac-related complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure. The use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin also increases the risk of bleeding.

   findings noted above.  The assessment and plans that is documented is
   consistent with our strategy over the next 24 hours.   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6431**]
   remains painfree this morning and has no specific complaints.  Her EKG
   is unchanged.  She is currently stable on aspirin, IV heparin, and IV
   nitroglycerin along with her lopressor and diltiazem. In the event that
   the patient develops more chest pain, we will begin eptifibatide and
   place an intra aortic balloon pump if conservative measures do not
   work.   The plans were discussed with the patients and with the cardiac
   surgical team.  All questions were addressed.  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3051**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6109**], MD

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery disease, chest pain, and anxiety. He is currently on increased simvastatin, and his blood pressure has been fluctuating with a recent spike to 190/150 mmHg. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. His respiratory support includes none, and his ABG results are not provided. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems, but there are some changes in his laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure spike to 190/150 mmHg may indicate a hypertensive emergency, which can lead to end-organ damage if not promptly managed.
2. Ischemic heart disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD) increases the risk of ischemic heart disease, which could potentially lead to myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent these complications.
4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures can increase the risk of nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
