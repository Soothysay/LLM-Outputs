   # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: The patient has chronic abdominal pain with
   previous negative workups; however, her current pain appears different
   from her chronic pain. On exam she is very tender to palpation. There
   is no rebound or guarding. LFTs at baseline.
   - Continue her outpatient management of her chronic pain: 2-4 mg po
   dilaudid q4 h as needed.
   - do not use IV dilaudid
   - if does not improve with improvement of BP, then would CT abd

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who presents with malignant hypertension and chronic abdominal pain. She has a history of intracerebral hemorrhage, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic abdominal pain, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The patient's current complaints include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Her vital signs show a blood pressure in the 200's despite medication, tachycardia, and elevated respiratory rate. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, no rebound or guarding, and no signs of peripheral edema. Laboratory results indicate hyperkalemia and anemia of chronic renal disease. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications for hypertension, pain control, and other chronic conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency/crisis: The patient's high blood pressure poses a risk for complications such as intracranial hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, or heart failure. Aggressive blood pressure management is crucial to prevent these complications.

2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of ESRD suggest that her renal function may be further compromised. This can lead to an increase in potassium levels, fluid overload, and difficulty managing her current medical conditions.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's trace guaiac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), presenting with hypertensive urgency and chronic abdominal pain. She has a history of intracerebral hemorrhage, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic abdominal pain, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 134/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on multiple medications including Aliskiren, Clonidine, Labetalol, Nifedipine, Hydralazine, and others. The patient underwent dialysis yesterday and is scheduled for another one today. Her abdominal pain has improved, but she still complains of nausea and vomiting. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's history of malignant hypertension and current presentation with blood pressure readings in the 200's indicate a high risk for hypertensive crisis. This can lead to end-organ damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Renal complications: Given the patient's ESRD and ongoing hemodialysis treatment, there is a risk of further renal deterioration or complications related to the dialysis process.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's chronic abdominal pain and recent symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and trace guai"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypertension. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, itching from Percocet (oxycodone/acetaminophen), and itching from morphine. The patient is currently receiving infusions and other ICU medications.

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate: 97 bpm (91-106 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 152/108 mmHg (116/92-236/152 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (17-26 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on room air

Hemodynamic monitoring:
- Mean arterial pressure (MAP): Not provided
- Central venous pressure (CVP): Not provided
- Urine output: 100 mL since 12 AM, 125 mL total

Fluid balance:
- Total input: 23 mL since 12 AM, 80 mL total
- Total output: 50 mL since 12 AM, 250 mL total (including 100 mL urine output)
- Fluid balance: -227 mL since 12 AM, -695 mL total

Laboratory results:
- Hemoglobin: 13.1 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 7.0 K/uL (6.8-8.7 K/uL)
- Platelet count: 126 K/uL (145-175 K/uL)
- Creatinine: 7.7 mg/dL (7.9 mg/dL)
- Blood glucose: 98 mg/dL (122 mg/dL)
- Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.5/30.1/1.3, Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Calcium: 9.6 mg/dL, Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL, Phosphate: 7.1 mg/dL

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypertension, malignant (hypertensive crisis, hypertensive emergency)
2. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)

Potential medical complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's high blood pressure readings indicate a hypertensive crisis. If left untreated, this can lead to organ damage or failure.

2. Acute kidney injury: The elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. This could be due to the hypertensive crisis or other underlying conditions.

3. Infection: The patient's low white blood cell count may indicate an infection. Monitoring for signs of infection is crucial to prevent its progression.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, malignant hypertension with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic abdominal pain, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. She was admitted due to hypertensive urgency after experiencing nausea, vomiting, and being unable to take her oral medications. The patient has several medical complications, including anemia of chronic renal disease, history of thrombotic events/SVC syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and multiple medical admissions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's high blood pressure poses a risk of complications such as intracranial hemorrhage, heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage if not managed properly.
2. Abdominal Pain/Diarrhea: Chronic abdominal pain and recent symptoms of diarrhea could indicate gastrointestinal issues like inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient's ongoing symptoms of nausea and vomiting may be related to her hypertensive urgency or underlying gastrointestinal conditions. It is important to address these symptoms to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing hemodialysis to manage her renal function and prevent further complications.
5. SLE:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), malignant hypertension with a history of intracerebral hemorrhage, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic abdominal pain, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. She was admitted due to hypertensive urgency after developing nausea and vomiting and being unable to take her oral medications.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. Firstly, she has malignant hypertension, which requires careful management to prevent further complications such as intracerebral hemorrhage or other cardiovascular events. Secondly, she has a history of intracerebral hemorrhage, which increases her risk for recurrent bleeding events. Thirdly, she has SLE, an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems and cause various complications. Fourthly, she experiences chronic abdominal pain, which may require further evaluation and management. Fifthly, she has SVC syndrome, which is a condition where there is obstruction of the superior vena cava, leading to impaired blood flow from the upper body back to the heart. Lastly, she has anemia of chronic renal disease, for which erythropoietin (EPO) therapy may be necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypertension, recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage, exacerbation of SLE symptoms, gastrointestinal issues, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary"

   use this for up to 2-3 hours. In between PO hydral doses, can then also
   use 10 IV hydralazine.
   - Aggressive pain control
   # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: The patient has chronic abdominal pain with
   previous negative workups; however presenting pain appeared different
   from her chronic pain.  Given diarrhea, there is some concern for
   narcotic withdrawal while at home, with resulting rebound in pain and
   other symptoms.  GI consulted yesterday and recommended CTA abdomen to
   evaluate for mesenteric ischemia (lactate 0.9 on admission) and serum
   lead and urine porphyrobilinogen.

The patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, a history of intracerebral hemorrhage, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic abdominal pain, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. She presented with hypertensive urgency, nausea, and vomiting. The patient has been weaned off nicardipine and is currently on multiple antihypertensive medications. Her abdominal pain has improved significantly, but further evaluation is needed for possible mesenteric ischemia or partial small bowel obstruction. The patient also requires management for anemia of chronic renal disease, SLE, and history of thrombotic events/SVC syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's chronic hypertension related to ESRD needs to be managed carefully to prevent further complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or cardiovascular events.
2. Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: Chronic abdominal pain with negative workups could be attributed to narcotic withdrawal or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation with CTA abdomen is recommended to assess for mesenteric ischemia and serum lead and urine porphyrobilinogen levels should be followed up.
3. Nausea/vomiting: Although resolved, close monitoring and appropriate antiemetic medications should be continued to prevent recurrence.
4. ESRD on HD: Proper renal consult and management are essential to"

","The patient's progress note indicates that they have been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of malignant hypertension. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 94/50 mmHg to 165/114 mmHg. They are currently on multiple medications, including nicardipine, which has been weaned off.

The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) with improvement in their blood pressure. The abdominal pain is being evaluated further with a computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess for mesenteric ischemia versus partial small bowel obstruction. If the CTA is not possible, a kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) x-ray will be done to rule out partial small bowel obstruction.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, Percocet (which causes itching), morphine (also causing itching), and possibly other medications. The patient's serum hCG level is negative.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the abdominal pain. Vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable heart rate, fluctuating blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate with oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows a negative balance of 845 mL over the past 24 hours. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals sinus rhythm with fluctuating blood pressures. The patient has received a total of 230 mL of intravenous fluids and has had a total output of 1075 mL, including 125 mL"

   can use this for up to 2-3 hours. In between PO hydral doses, can then
   also use 10 IV hydralazine.
   - aggressive pain control, which will help her BP
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: The patient has chronic abdominal pain with
   previous negative workups; however, her current pain appears different
   from her chronic pain. On exam she is very tender to palpation. There
   is no rebound or guarding. LFTs at baseline.
   - Continue her outpatient management of her chronic pain: 2-4 mg po
   dilaudid q4 h as needed.
   - do not use IV dilaudid
   - if does not improve with improvement of BP, then would CT abd
   - lactate normal

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malignant hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic abdominal pain, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. She was admitted due to hypertensive urgency and is currently in the ICU. The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and today, with improvement in blood pressure. She has chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea, and her symptoms may be related to ESRD. The patient is on multiple medications for various conditions, including antihypertensives, pain management, and management of SLE.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient has a history of malignant hypertension, which can lead to complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or heart failure if not properly managed.
2. Abdominal Pain/Diarrhea: The patient's chronic abdominal pain may have a different cause than her previous episodes. Given her ESRD, gastrointestinal complications are a concern, including mesenteric ischemia or partial small bowel obstruction. Further evaluation, such as a CT abdomen or KUB, may be necessary to rule out these conditions.
3. Anemia of Chronic Renal Disease: The patient's Hct was 29 on admission, indicating anemia. Chronic renal disease can cause anemia due to decreased production of erythropoietin. Epo"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), malignant hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic abdominal pain, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. She presented with hypertensive urgency and was unable to take her oral medications due to nausea and vomiting. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's chronic hypertension is related to ESRD. Her head CT was negative for intracranial bleed. She will continue her home regimen of antihypertensive medications and will be weaned off nicardipine gtt. If her systolic blood pressure (SBP) is >180, she will be given 25 mg PO hydralazine every 30 minutes until SBP<150. IV hydralazine can also be used between doses of PO hydralazine.
2. Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: The patient has chronic abdominal pain with previous negative workups. Her current pain appears different from her chronic pain, and she is tender to palpation in the left upper quadrant (LUQ). There is no rebound or guarding. Lactate levels are normal. She will continue her outpatient management of chronic pain with 2-4 mg PO dilaudid q4h as needed. If her symptoms do not improve with improvement"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malignant hypertension, intracerebral hemorrhage, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic abdominal pain, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. She was admitted due to hypertensive urgency and was unable to take her oral medications. She is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has been weaned off nicardipine. The patient has significant improvement in her abdominal pain and reports feeling much better. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient has a chronic issue related to ESRD, which can cause malignant hypertension. It is important to continue her home regimen of antihypertensive medications and closely monitor her blood pressure.
2. Abdominal Pain/Diarrhea: The patient has chronic abdominal pain with previous negative workups. Her current pain appears different from her chronic pain, and she is tender to palpation. There is no rebound or guarding. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of her abdominal pain and diarrhea.
3. ESRD on HD: The patient is on HD due to hyperkalemia. It is important to monitor her electrolyte levels and continue with renal consult recommendations. She should also follow a renal diet and take kayexalate as needed for hyperkalemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic pain, and an allergic reaction to penicillins, Percocet, and morphine. The patient is currently in the ICU due to malignant hypertension, but the specific cause or event leading to the admission is not mentioned. The patient's vital signs have been stable with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate between 73-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83-119/50-71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is receiving respiratory support but does not require supplemental oxygen. Hemodynamic monitoring shows normal fluid balance.

The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and their neurologic examination is incomplete. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, and lactic acid, while other parameters are within normal ranges. The patient has received multiple infusions and medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypertensive emergency or crisis: The patient's blood pressure readings are significantly high, indicating a potential hypertensive emergency or crisis. Immediate management is crucial to prevent organ damage.
2. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics, suggesting an underlying infection"

   24 yo female with ESRD on HD, malignant hypertension with hx of
   intracerebral hemorrhage, SLE, chronic abdominal pain, and SVC syndrome
   admitted due to hypertensive urgency after developing N/V and being
   unable to take her po medications.
   # Hypertensive urgency:
   -Continue outpatient medications
   -Hydralazine prn
   # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea:
   -Chronic issue did report pain improved.
   -Will clarify how much pain meds she is taking as narcotic withdrawal
   could explain these symptoms.  If she has not been using her fentyl
   patch appropriately she could be withdrawing.
   -Will ask GI to weigh to see if she would benefit from  Sigmoidoscopy
   scan, led and porphyyrins pending.
   # Nausea/vomiting:
   -Continue prn meds
   -No IV dilaudid per PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] HcG serum
   # ESRD on HD:
   -Contiue dialysis
   -Continue renal diet and phos binder
   -Cont K exalate
   # SLE:
   - Continue outpatient regimen of 4 mg of prednisone daily.
   # Anemia of chronic renal disease: Her Hct was 29 on admission.
   - Epo at HD per renal.
   # History of thrombotic events/SVC syndrome: She is anticoagulated with
   warfarin as an outpatient. Previous documentation in OMR states she
   does not need to be bridged while subtherapeutic.
   - Continue coumadin 4 mg po daily.
   - check INR
   # OSA: She is on CPAP at a setting of 7 as an outpatient.
   - Continue CPAP
   #Multiple medical admission
   -Will get social work involved
   -Would consider VNA to help with medications at home and home med
   counts
   -Will also consider narcotic withdrawal.
   -I suspect there is a med compliance/narcotic missuse as the etiology
   of her decompensations given that she responds very well to treatment
   while in the hospital.

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo female with ESRD on HD, malignant hypertension with hx of
   intracerebral hemorrhage, SLE, chronic abdominal pain, and SVC syndrome
   admitted due to hypertensive urgency after developing N/V and being
   unable to take her po medications.
   # Hypertensive urgency:
   -Continue outpatient medications
   -Hydralazine prn
   # Abdominal pain/Diarrhea:
   -Chronic issue did report pain improved.
   -Will clarify how much pain meds she is taking as narcotic withdrawal
   could explain these symptoms.  If she has not been using her fentyl
   patch appropriately she could be withdrawing.
   -Will ask GI to weigh to see if she would benefit from  Sigmoidoscopy
   scan, lead and porphyrins pending.
   # Nausea/vomiting:
   -Continue prn meds
   -No IV dilaudid per PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] HcG serum
   # ESRD on HD:
   -Contiue dialysis
   -Continue renal diet and phos binder
   -Cont K exalate
   # SLE:
   - Continue outpatient regimen of 4 mg of prednisone daily.
   # Anemia of chronic renal disease: Her Hct was 29 on admission.
   - Epo at HD per renal.
   # History of thrombotic events/SVC syndrome: She is anticoagulated with
   warfarin as an outpatient. Previous documentation in OMR states she
   does not need to be bridged while subtherapeutic.
   - Continue coumadin 4 mg po daily.
   - check INR
   # OSA: She is on CPAP at a setting of 7 as an outpatient.
   - Continue CPAP
   #Multiple medical admission
   -Will get social work involved
   -Would consider VNA to help with medications at home and home med
   counts
   -Will also consider narcotic withdrawal.
   -I suspect there is a med compliance/narcotic missuse as the etiology
   of her decompensations given that she responds very well to treatment
   while in the hospital. Possibility of psychiatric consultation if this
   continues

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), malignant hypertension, history of intracerebral hemorrhage, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic abdominal pain, and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. She was admitted due to hypertensive urgency after developing nausea and vomiting and being unable to take her oral medications.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her conditions. These include:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed to prevent complications such as stroke, heart attack, or damage to organs.

2. Abdominal pain and diarrhea: The patient has a history of chronic abdominal pain, which may be related to her ESRD or other underlying conditions. Diarrhea can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

3. Nausea and vomiting: These symptoms can be caused by various factors, including medications, underlying medical conditions, or gastrointestinal issues. If not managed appropriately, they can lead to further dehydration and nutritional deficiencies.

4. SLE: The patient has a history of SLE, an autoimmune disorder that can affect multiple organs and systems in the body. Flares or worsening of SLE symptoms can occur and require prompt management.

5. ESRD on HD: The patient's kidney failure requires ongoing dialysis treatment to manage fluid and electrolyte balance. Non"
