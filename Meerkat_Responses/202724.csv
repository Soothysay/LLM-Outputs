   CXR: : There is unchanged moderate
   cardiomegaly, with midline intact sternal wires and vascular clips from
   prior
   CABG. A left chest pacing device is in unchanged position. A mechanical
   valve is also apparently unchanged. Lung volumes are low and there is
   mild
   atelectasis at the lung bases, but no focal consolidation. Overall,
   vascular
   congestion appears similar to the prior study.
   Assessment and Plan
   63 y/o M on coumadin for mechanical valve presents with sub-acute
   fatigue and likely melana found to have a hematocrit of 23
   .
   # GI BLEED:  Both lower and upper sources of bleeding are considered.
   Description of stool over past several weeks most consistent with
   melana, which is usually from UGIB although can be anywhere above right
   colon.  Noted to have negative NGT lavage in ED.  Patient
   hemodynamically stable without evidence of active GI bleed at this
   time.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of mechanical valve, presenting with sub-acute fatigue and likely melena. He has a hematocrit of 23 and is hemodynamically stable without evidence of active GI bleed at this time. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/48 mmHg to 127/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on BiPap mask. The patient is on telemetry, large bore peripheral IV access, active type and screen, serial HCT Q6-8hr, transfusion for HCT <26 or active bleeding, pantoprazole gtt, GI consult, NPO for possible scope, hold Coumadin and trend INR, hold aspirin for now, and hold hypertensives in the setting of GI bleed.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. GI bleed: The patient has melena, which indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Continued monitoring for signs of active bleeding and appropriate management, including transfusion and endoscopy, will be necessary.

2. Mechanical valve management: The patient is on Coumadin for a mechanical valve. Due to the GI bleed, Coumadin has been held and INR needs to be monitored. Heparin drip will be initiated for INR <2."

","The patient is a 63-year-old male who presents with sub-acute fatigue and likely melena, indicating a possible gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has a history of diverticulosis and mechanical heart valve, for which he is on coumadin. The negative NGT lavage suggests that the source of bleeding may be lower GI rather than upper GI. The patient is currently stable without evidence of active GI bleed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/48-127/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on BiPap.

Physical examination reveals a supple neck, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds.

Lab results show a hematocrit of 23.3, leukocyte count of 7.7 K/uL, platelet count of 272 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose of 92 mg/dL, sodium of 27 mEq/L, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride of 108 mEq/L, and bicarbonate of 25.2%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who presented with sub-acute fatigue and melena. He has a history of diverticulosis and is on Coumadin for a mechanical valve. The patient's hematocrit level is low at 23%. There is a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding, likely lower gastrointestinal bleeding given the history of diverticulosis. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable without evidence of active bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's melena and history of diverticulosis suggest that he may be experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to hypotension and shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: Due to the potential ongoing blood loss, the patient is at risk of developing hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and lead to organ failure.
3. Thromboembolism: As the patient is on Coumadin for a mechanical valve, there is a risk of thromboembolism if the INR levels are not maintained within the therapeutic range.
4. Infection: The patient may be at risk for infections due to indwelling lines and potential invasive procedures.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient is using BiPap for OSA, and there is a possibility of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Electrolyte imbalances: Due to ongoing bleeding and potential fluid resuscitation, there is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of mechanical valve replacement, presenting with sub-acute fatigue and likely melena, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient's initial hematocrit level was 23%, which has improved after receiving two units of blood transfusion. He is currently stable without evidence of active bleeding. The source of bleeding is suspected to be upper gastrointestinal (UGIB) rather than lower gastrointestinal (LGIB), although both possibilities should be considered. The patient has a history of diverticulosis on most recent colonoscopy.

Potential Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the underlying cause of the initial bleeding is not addressed or if there are any coagulation abnormalities.
2. Infection: Given the invasive procedures and potential exposure to bacteria during endoscopy or blood transfusion, there is a risk of developing an infection.
3. Thrombosis: As the patient is on Coumadin for a mechanical valve, there is a risk of bleeding complications. However, there is also a risk of thrombosis due to reduced anticoagulation during the acute bleeding event.
4. Hypotension and shock: If the bleeding is significant and not controlled promptly, the patient may develop hypotension and shock.
5. Kidney injury: If the patient experiences severe hypotension or shock, it can lead to renal hypoperfusion and acute kidney"

The patient has a history of diverticulosis and negative nasogastric tube (NGT) lavage, suggesting a possible lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. However, the clinical presentation appears to be more consistent with upper GI bleeding (UGIB).

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a blood pressure of 110/56 mmHg and a heart rate of 62 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 93% on room air. The patient's respiratory support consists of none, indicating that he is breathing spontaneously. 

The physical examination reveals an alert and oriented patient without acute distress. His sclera is anicteric, and there are no signs of jugular venous distention (JVD), lower extremity edema (LAE), or liver auscultation abnormalities (LAD). Lung auscultation is clear bilaterally without wheezes, rales, or ronchi. The cardiovascular examination shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 + S2 sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with present bowel sounds and no rebound tenderness or guarding. No organomegaly is noted."

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of mechanical valve replacement, presenting with sub-acute fatigue and melena. He was found to have a hematocrit of 23. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. 

Assessment:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has a suspected upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed, possibly related to his history of diverticulosis. However, a lower gastrointestinal (LGIB) source cannot be ruled out. The patient's vital signs are stable, and there is no evidence of active bleeding at this time. 
2. Mechanical Valve: The patient requires anticoagulation therapy to maintain an INR between 2.5 and 3.5. However, due to the current bleeding episode, anticoagulant therapy with Coumadin has been held, and heparin is being used instead.
3. Hypertension: The patient's home anti-hypertensive medications have been held, and blood pressure control will be monitored and managed accordingly.
4. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient uses BiPap at home, and this should be continued in the ICU setting.
5. Gout: No evidence of gout flare is present, and the patient will be monitored clinically with colchicine as needed.
6. Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: The patient is receiving IV fluids and electrolyte levels will be monitored. No IV fluid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male on coumadin for a mechanical valve, presenting with sub-acute fatigue and likely melena. Hematocrit levels have been consistently decreasing from 25.2 to 23.2%. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being monitored on telemetry. Large bore peripheral IV access has been established, along with active type and screen. H. pylori follow-up has been scheduled, and post-transfusion HCT/coagulation studies have been ordered. The patient's INR is below the therapeutic range, and heparin drip has been started when INR is less than 2.5. Aspirin has been held, and hypertensives have been withheld in the setting of GI bleed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient presents with sub-acute fatigue and melena, which suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) should also be considered, especially given the history of diverticulosis. The patient's hemodynamic stability without evidence of active bleeding at this time is a positive sign. However, continuous monitoring and appropriate interventions such as transfusion and medication adjustments are necessary to manage potential complications associated with GI bleeding, including hypotension, shock, organ failure, and potential need for endoscopic intervention.

2. Mechanical Valve Management: The patient's mechanical valve requires anticoagulation therapy. The patient's INR is"
