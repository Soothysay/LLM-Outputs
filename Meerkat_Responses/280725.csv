   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p AVR on coumadin, admitted with septic shock
   likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient has leukocytosis and fever, making septic
   shock most likely.  Most likely source pneumonia given significant
   consolidations on chest CT, however per family patient was without
   significant pulmonary complains.  Alternative source would be RLE
   cellulitis.  Will evaluate for other sources with blood, urine,  stool
   cultures, but no other localizing symptoms from family.  Currently on
   Levophed and Vasopressin.  Vasopressin was added overnight so that
   levophed dose could be minized.    Cortisol normal.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue levophed / vasopressin to maintain SBP
   - currently volume replete, but bolus prn for low urine output
   - follow urine output
   - continue Vanco/ Zosyn to cover severe community acquired pneumonia
   and cellulitis in a diabetic
   - hold home antihypertensives and diuretics
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin.  Patient is currently anticoagulated and had
   negative CTA, so will not evaluate for DVT at present as it will not
   change management.
   - continue vancomycin
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Likely secondary to significant bilateral pneumonia, thoguh CXR and CTA
   initially read as pulmonary edema.  Oxygen requirements have been
   reduced overnight.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so may have a
   component of CHF as well.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%  and then PEEP to 5 if possible
   - vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient developed hypotension following fentanyl bolus
   that responded to fluid bolus and up-titration of levophed &
   vasopressin.  Increased fentanyl however improved tachycardia.  Given
   patient
s recent onset of visual hallucinations and history of
   agitation with opioids and benzos, anticipate that sedation will be
   difficult.
   - monitor mental status.
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia overnight.  Tachycardia did
   not respond to fluid boluses for Tylenol for fever, but improved with
   increased sedation (though this caused patient to be hypotensive).
   - monitor HR on telemetry
   - consider increased sedation for tachycardia
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoaguled for A. fib and aortic valve.  Will
   hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.  No need to bridge with heparin.
   - daily INR
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Now 1.7.  Elevated Cr may reflect
   worsening baseline in patient with HTN and DM, with prerenal vs. atn
   component.  Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   Continues to have low urine output.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - follow uop
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and preserved ejection fraction (EF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He is currently admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity (RLE) cellulitis. The patient is intubated for hypoxia and respiratory failure, receiving mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. He is sedated and on multiple medications including levophed, vasopressin, fentanyl, midazolam, and vancomycin/Zosyn.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's leukocytosis and fever suggest septic shock. The source of infection appears to be pneumonia, but alternative sources such as RLE cellulitis should be considered. The patient is already on levophed and vasopressin to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP), and further management will depend on culture data.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has a history of left lower extremity (LLE) cellulitis and now presents with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE. Given the elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and fever, cellulitis is likely. Vancomycin coverage for MRSA is appropriate,"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p AVR on coumadin, admitted with septic shock
   likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient has leukocytosis and fever, making septic
   shock most likely.  Most likely source pneumonia given significant
   consolidations on chest CT, however per family patient was without
   significant pulmonary complains.  Alternative source would be RLE
   cellulitis.  Will evaluate for other sources with blood, urine,  stool
   cultures, but no other localizing symptoms from family.  Currently on
   Levophed and Vasopressin.  Vasopressin was added overnight so that
   levophed dose could be minized.    Cortisol normal.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue levophed / vasopressin to maintain SBP
   - currently volume replete, but bolus prn for low urine output
   - follow urine output
   - continue Vanco/ Zosyn to cover severe community acquired pneumonia
   and cellulitis in a diabetic
   - hold home antihypertensives and diuretics
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin.  Patient is currently anticoagulated and had
   negative CTA, so will not evaluate for DVT at present as it will not
   change management.
   - continue vancomycin
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Likely secondary to significant bilateral pneumonia, thoguh CXR and CTA
   initially read as pulmonary edema.  Oxygen requirements have been
   reduced overnight.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so may have a
   component of CHF as well.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%  and then PEEP to 5 if possible
   - vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient developed hypotension following fentanyl bolus
   that responded to fluid bolus and up-titration of levophed &
   vasopressin.  Increased fentanyl however improved tachycardia.  Given
   patient
s recent onset of visual hallucinations and history of
   agitation with opioids and benzos, anticipate that sedation will be
   difficult.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn haldol for agitation to avoid hypotension
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia overnight.  Tachycardia did
   not respond to fluid boluses for Tylenol for fever, but improved with
   increased sedation (though this caused patient to be hypotensive).
   - monitor HR on telemetry
   - consider haldol for tachycardia if seems to be from agitation
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoaguled for A. fib and aortic valve.  Will
   hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.  No need to bridge with heparin.
   - daily INR
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Now 1.7.  Elevated Cr may reflect
   worsening baseline in patient with HTN and DM, with prerenal vs. atn
   component.  Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   Continues to have low urine output.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - follow uop
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), preserved ejection fraction (EF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is now admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity (RLE) cellulitis.

The patient has leukocytosis and fever, making septic shock most likely. The most likely source of infection is pneumonia given significant consolidations on chest CT, but alternative sources such as RLE cellulitis should also be considered. Blood, urine, and stool cultures will be evaluated for other potential sources of infection. The patient is currently on Levophed and Vasopressin to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP).

The patient also has cellulitis, with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE. He has a history of MRSA cellulitis. Vancomycin will continue to cover cellulitis, and blood cultures will be followed.

Respiratory failure is another concern, with initial intubation for hypoxia and respiratory failure due to significant bilateral pneumonia. Oxygen requirements have been reduced overnight, but the patient remains on mechanical ventilation. Weaning of FiO2 to 40% and then PEEP to 5 if possible will be considered.

Sedation is challenging due to the patient's"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma, admitted with fever, septic shock, and respiratory failure. The patient has been treated with invasive ventilation and vasopressors. He is currently on multiple antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Vancomycin. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring frequent adjustments in medication dosages and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, likely due to pneumonia or cellulitis. Continuous monitoring and management of blood pressure and heart rate are essential. Vasopressors may need to be titrated based on the patient's response.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, possibly due to multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Weaning off oxygen and adjusting ventilator settings will be necessary. Hypotension limits the ability to diurese.

3. Agitation: The patient has shown agitation, requiring increasing doses of fentanyl, which subsequently resulted in hypotension. Haldol can be started to manage agitation while monitoring for QTc prolongation.

4. Mechanical Aortic Valve: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve, necessitating the use of heparin if INR drops below 2. There is a risk of thrombosis given the mechanical valve.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has AR"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical problems who was admitted with fever, septic shock, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Shock: The patient's condition suggests ongoing septic shock, as indicated by the need for vasopressor support and titration. Continuous monitoring and management of blood pressure and organ perfusion are crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to a combination of multifocal pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Weaning off mechanical ventilation and optimizing oxygenation should be considered while monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress or deterioration.
3. Agitation: The patient has been agitated and required increasing doses of fentanyl, which subsequently resulted in hypotension. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and hemodynamic status is necessary. Consideration can be given to starting antipsychotic medication like haloperidol to manage agitation.
4. Mechanical AVR: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve, and the INR is within therapeutic range. However, there is a risk of thrombosis given the mechanical valve. Monitoring the INR and starting heparin if it drops below 2 should be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors overnight. Still with
   fever spike to 101 overnight on vanc/zosyn with most likely cause of
   septic shock from pulmonary or cellulitic source. Sputum culture grew
   out sparse coag + staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE
   although now with increasing RLE erythema
   - restart low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Currently no concern for necrotizing
   fascitis or myositis, but mark area and follow exam
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - mark area of erythema
   - add on CK
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Now weaning down with RISB in Am of 61, then 100.  Likely secondary to
   PNA. Sputum culture pending.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so
   may have a component of CHF as well.
   - RISB and wean down to CPAP from AC
   - continue vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia, f/u
   cultures
   - IV lasix for diuresis if no self-diuresis
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient started on IV haldol overnight and able to wean
   down on sedation, although still on fentanyl boluses
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - change haldol to standing, continue wean down on fentanyl
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable
   - restart metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Continues to decrease, 1.4 this AM.
   Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

   Sputum culture [**10-20**] with sparse coag+ staph growth
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors overnight. Still with
   fever spike to 101 overnight on vanc/zosyn with most likely cause of
   septic shock from pulmonary or cellulitic source. Sputum culture grew
   out sparse coag + staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE
   although now with increasing RLE erythema
   - restart low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Currently no concern for necrotizing
   fascitis or myositis, but mark area and follow exam
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - mark area of erythema
   - add on CK
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Now weaning down with RISB in Am of 61, then 100.  Likely secondary to
   PNA. Sputum culture pending.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so
   may have a component of CHF as well.
   - RISB and wean down to CPAP from AC
   - continue vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia, f/u
   cultures
   - IV lasix for diuresis if no self-diuresis
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient started on IV haldol overnight and able to wean
   down on sedation, although still on fentanyl boluses
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - change haldol to standing, continue wean down on fentanyl
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable
   - restart metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Continues to decrease, 1.4 this AM.
   Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, preserved ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous mechanical aortic valve replacement. He was admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity cellulitis. The patient's fever persists despite being on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and he has a history of MRSA cellulitis. There is increased redness, warmth, and pain in the right lower extremity, which raises concern for cellulitis. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia, and he has been intubated. His sedation has been weaned down, but he still requires fentanyl boluses. The patient also has tachycardia, and his anticoagulation therapy needs to be adjusted due to atrial fibrillation and mechanical aortic valve. Additionally, there are concerns about acute renal failure, type 2 diabetes management, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's fever persists, and the source of septic shock remains unclear. It is important to continue monitoring his vital signs and ensuring appropriate antibiotic coverage.
2. Cellulitis: The increasing redness, warmth, and pain in the right lower extremity suggest worsening cellulitis. Close monitoring and continued antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent further complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p AVR on coumadin, admitted with septic shock
   likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.  Septic shock.  Patient has leukocytosis and fever, making septic
   shock most likely.  Most likely source pneumonia given significant
   consolidations on chest CT, however per family patient was without
   significant pulmonary complains.  Alternative source would be RLE
   cellulitis.  Will evaluate for other sources with blood, urine,  stool
   cultures, but no other localizing symptoms from family.  Currently on
   Levophed and Vasopressin.  Vasopressin was added overnight so that
   levophed dose could be minized.    Cortisol normal.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue levophed / vasopressin to maintain SBP
   - currently volume replete, but bolus prn for low urine output
   - follow urine output
   - continue Vanco/ Zosyn to cover severe community acquired pneumonia
   and cellulitis in a diabetic
   - hold home antihypertensives and diuretics
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin.  Patient is currently anticoagulated and had
   negative CTA, so will not evaluate for DVT at present as it will not
   change management.
   - continue vancomycin
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Likely secondary to significant bilateral pneumonia, thoguh CXR and CTA
   initially read as pulmonary edema.  Oxygen requirements have been
   reduced overnight.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so may have a
   component of CHF as well.
   - wean FIO2 to 40%  and then PEEP to 5 if possible
   - vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient developed hypotension following fentanyl bolus
   that responded to fluid bolus and up-titration of levophed &
   vasopressin.  Increased fentanyl however improved tachycardia.  Given
   patient
s recent onset of visual hallucinations and history of
   agitation with opioids and benzos, anticipate that sedation will be
   difficult.
   - monitor mental status
   - prn haldol for agitation to avoid hypotension
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia overnight.  Tachycardia did
   not respond to fluid boluses for Tylenol for fever, but improved with
   increased sedation (though this caused patient to be hypotensive).
   - monitor HR on telemetry
   - consider haldol for tachycardia if seems to be from agitation
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoaguled for A. fib and aortic valve.  Will
   hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.  No need to bridge with heparin.
   - daily INR
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Now 1.7.  Elevated Cr may reflect
   worsening baseline in patient with HTN and DM, with prerenal vs. atn
   component.  Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   Continues to have low urine output.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - follow uop
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, preserved ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cerebrovascular accident. He was admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity cellulitis. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Septic shock: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, which suggests septic shock. The most likely source is pneumonia, given significant consolidations on chest CT. However, an alternative source could be right lower extremity cellulitis. The patient is currently on levophed and vasopressin to maintain systemic blood pressure. Cortisol levels are normal.
- Cellulitis: The patient has a history of left lower extremity cellulitis and now presents with increased redness, warmth, and pain in the right lower extremity. He has a history of MRSA cellulitis. Cellulitis is covered with vancomycin. The patient is anticoagulated, and a negative computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been performed, so there is no need to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at present as it will not change management.
- Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for hypoxia and respiratory failure. Initially on 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 15 and oxygen saturation ("

   Assessment and Plan
   1)Sepsis- RLE cellulitis/pna. Cont Vanc/Zosyn. Clinically improved in
   that he is off pressors, but cellulitis extensive, ?spreading.
   2)Resp Failure- Good RSBI today- will repeat and try to keep on PS if
   looks good. Very thick secretions reported, will follow.
   3)ARF- Improved, Fluid balance has been positive. Consider Lasix if
   continues to run positive today.
   4)Cellulitis- WBC decreasing, no fever since noon yesterday, off
   pressors, so unlikely deeper infection like necrotizing fasciitis, but
   quite extensive, will repeat exam later in day and closely follow.
   Consider surgical consult if continues to extend.
   5)Neuro- continue Haldol, change to standing and wean sedation.
   fentanyl for pain.
   6)CV- tachycardia, will increase metoprolol to home dosing as long as
   BP stable.cont asa, statin, zetia.
   7)Heme- anticoagulated for mechanical AVR and afib. Check coags today.
   Holding coumadin for now, start Heparin if INR<2.5.
   8) FEN- on tube feeds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity cellulitis. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and sedation. He has been febrile, tachycardic, and required vasopressors. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but sputum culture shows sparse coag-positive Staphylococcus. His white blood cell count is elevated, and his creatinine levels are increasing. The patient's condition has shown improvement as he is now off vasopressors and has a good respiratory system infection index (RSBI). He is receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam), tube feeds, and other ICU medications. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, mechanical aortic valve replacement, and chronic kidney disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis - The patient initially presented with sepsis secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity cellulitis. There is still a risk of worsening sepsis or development of new infections due to prolonged ICU stay and mechanical ventilation.
2. Respiratory Failure - The patient requires mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and complications related to weaning off the ventilator.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF) - The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating possible ARF. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors and has been Afebrile
   for 48 hours on vanco/zosyn.   Sputum culture grew out sparse coag +
   staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE.  Cellulitis appears
   unchaged, but with low vanco trough, may be secondary to under-dosing.
   - continue low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   - increase vancomycin dose due to low vanco trough
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history of MRSA
   cellulitis.  Cellulitis is covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Exam appears
   unchanged from yesterday, but little improvement.  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to
   under-dosing of vancomycin.  CK low yesterday.
   - monitor cellulitis clnically
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia, likely
   secondary to pneumonia +/- CHF.  On vanco/zosyn for pneumonia.
   Tolerated SBT well with RSBI of 80 today, but patient remains to
   sedated for extubation.
   - lighten sedation and evaluate for extubation later
   - discuss with family re: decision to re-intubate if necessary
   - lasix diuresis (on home dose
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Improvement of agitation with IV haldol.  QTc of 444 on
   [**10-22**].   Too sedated for extubation today, so will lighten sedation and
   re-evaluate.
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - continue haldol
   - wean fentanyl/versed
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable.
   - continue metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Creatinine now at baseline of 1.2.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - continue home lasix
   - hold lisinopril

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors overnight. Still with
   fever spike to 101 overnight on vanc/zosyn with most likely cause of
   septic shock from pulmonary or cellulitic source. Sputum culture grew
   out sparse coag + staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE
   although now with increasing RLE erythema
   - restart low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with increased redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history
   of MRSA cellulitis.  Also with elevated WBC and fever.  Cellulitis is
   covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Currently no concern for necrotizing
   fascitis or myositis, but mark area and follow exam
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - mark area of erythema
   - add on CK
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia and respiratory
   failure.  Initially on 100% FIO2 with PEEP 15 and o2 sats in low 90s.
   Now weaning down with RISB in Am of 61, then 100.  Likely secondary to
   PNA. Sputum culture pending.  BNP significantly elevated as well, so
   may have a component of CHF as well.
   - RISB and wean down to CPAP from AC
   - continue vanco/zosyn for severe community acquired pneumonia, f/u
   cultures
   - IV lasix for diuresis if no self-diuresis
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient started on IV haldol overnight and able to wean
   down on sedation, although still on fentanyl boluses.  QTc of 444 on
   [**10-22**].
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - change haldol to standing, continue wean down on fentanyl
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable
   - restart metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Baseline Cr of 1.3.  Continues to decrease, 1.4 this AM.
   Urine lytes suggest patient is pre-renal.  S/p 6L IVF.
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - hold lisinopril
   - hold lasix
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. He has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he is experiencing atrial fibrillation. His fluid balance shows a negative balance of 840 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV ventilation with set Vt of 650 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 20, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 84. His blood gases indicate PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 197. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and slightly elevated Cr levels. His glucose levels have been within normal range. The patient's neurological status is not assessed due to sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics, suggesting an ongoing infection. It is important to monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, increased WBC count, or changes in vital signs.
2. Fluid Balance: The negative fluid balance indicates ongoing losses, which need to be carefully managed to prevent dehydration.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits now off
   pressors but still intubated, with plan for family meeting today.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors and has been Afebrile
   for 72 hours on vanco/zosyn.   Sputum culture grew out sparse coag +
   staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE.  Cellulitis is improved
   on antibiotics.
   - continue low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn (day#4 today) for coverage of CAP and cellulitis
   in a diabetic patient. Will recheck vanc trough tomorrow
   - f/u culture data
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Bilateral cellulitis slightly improved overnight.
   Vanc/zosyn appropriate coverage as patient has h/o MRSA cellulitis and
   is a diabetic. BCx NGTD so far
   - continue vanc/zosyn
   - monitor cellulitis clinically
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia (day 3$ today),
   likely secondary to pneumonia +/- CHF.  Patient with good diuresis
   overnight on home diuretics dose. On vanco/zosyn for pneumonia.
   Tolerated SBT well with RSBI of 80 today, but has been difficult to
   wean patient completely off sedation as he becomes agitated. Is also
   more tachypneic today.
   - family meeting planned to discuss larger goals of care today,
   including extubation. Patient may need non-invasives but may be
   difficult to tolerate given history of agitation
   - continue with diuresis
 has had good output to home PO diuretics.
   Goal 1-2L out overnight. Will give IV dose if necessary.
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Patient is now on propofol for comfort while still
   intubated. s/p versed/fentanyl drips. Has history of paranoia,
   agitation at home and we will have to deal with these issues when
   patient is more awake
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - continue propofol as needed
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  BP controlled overnight on low dose metoprolol.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable.
   - continue metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.  INR 3.1 yesterday,
   pending level for today
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Creatinine now at baseline of 1.2.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - continue home lasix
   - hold lisinopril

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 512**] is a 73 yo male with CAD with preserved EF, type 2
   DM, HTN, HL, h/o CVA, s/p mechanical AVR on coumadin, admitted with
   septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and RLE cellulits.
   .
   1.Septic shock.  Patient weaned off of pressors and has been Afebrile
   for 48 hours on vanco/zosyn.   Sputum culture grew out sparse coag +
   staph. Patient with h/o MRSA cellulitis in LLE.  Cellulitis appears
   unchaged, but with low vanco trough, may be secondary to under-dosing.
   - continue low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   - increase vancomycin dose due to low vanco trough
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history of MRSA
   cellulitis.  Cellulitis is covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Exam appears
   unchanged from yesterday, but little improvement.  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to
   under-dosing of vancomycin.  CK low yesterday.
   - monitor cellulitis clnically
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia, likely
   secondary to pneumonia +/- CHF.  On vanco/zosyn for pneumonia.
   Tolerated SBT well with RSBI of 80 today, but patient remains to
   sedated for extubation.
   - lighten sedation and evaluate for extubation later
   - discuss with family re: decision to re-intubate if necessary
   - lasix diuresis (on home dose
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Improvement of agitation with IV haldol.  QTc of 444 on
   [**10-22**].   Too sedated for extubation today, so will lighten sedation and
   re-evaluate.
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - continue haldol
   - wean fentanyl/versed
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable.
   - continue metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Creatinine now at baseline of 1.2.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - continue home lasix
   - hold lisinopril

   unchaged, but with low vanco trough, may be secondary to under-dosing.
   - continue low dose metoprolol for rate control, watching BP closely
   - continue vanc/zosyn for coverage of CAP and cellulitis in a diabetic
   patient
   - f/u culture data
   - increase vancomycin dose due to low vanco trough
   .
   2.  Cellulitis.  Patient has history of LLE cellulitis and now presents
   with redness, warmth, and pain in RLE.  Patient has history of MRSA
   cellulitis.  Cellulitis is covered with vancomycin/zosyn.  Exam appears
   unchanged from yesterday, but little improvement.  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to
   under-dosing of vancomycin.  CK low yesterday.
   - monitor cellulitis clnically
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for hypoxia, likely
   secondary to pneumonia +/- CHF.  On vanco/zosyn for pneumonia.
   Tolerated SBT well with RSBI of 80 today, but patient remains to
   sedated for extubation.
   - lighten sedation and evaluate for extubation later
   - discuss with family re: decision to re-intubate if necessary
   - lasix diuresis (on home dose
   .
   4.   Sedation.  Improvement of agitation with IV haldol.  QTc of 444 on
   [**10-22**].   Too sedated for extubation today, so will lighten sedation and
   re-evaluate.
   - monitor mental status as patient with h/o agitation/hallucinations
   - continue haldol
   - wean fentanyl/versed
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  Patient had tachycardia after vasopressin weaned off.
   Patient on 100mg TID of metoprolol at home. BP has been stable.
   - continue metoprolol at low dose and titrate up as tolerated for HR
   control
   .
   6.  Anticoagulation.  Anticoagulated for A. fib and mechanical aortic
   valve.  Will hold coumadin for now and monitor INR.
   - daily INR
   - consider bridging with coumadin when INR lower than 2.5
   - hold coumadin
   .
   7.  ARF.  Creatinine now at baseline of 1.2.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow uop and Cr
   .
   8.  Type 2 DM.  Last HgA1C of 6.1.
   - hold glyburide
   - ISS
   - follow fingersticks
   .
   9.  CAD.  s/p CABG x 4.  EF 60%.
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin, ezetemide
   - continue home lasix
   - hold lisinopril
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, preserved ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of cerebrovascular accident, and mechanical aortic valve replacement. He was admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and right lower extremity cellulitis. The patient has been weaned off pressors and has been afebrile for 48 hours on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. His sputum culture grew out sparse coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The patient has a history of MRSA cellulitis in the left lower extremity. The cellulitis appears unchanged, but with low vancomycin trough, it may be secondary to under-dosing. The patient is currently on low-dose metoprolol for rate control, and his blood pressure is being closely monitored.

The patient's respiratory failure is due to hypoxia, likely secondary to pneumonia and/or congestive heart failure. He is intubated and receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for pneumonia. The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial well with a respiratory severity index (RSBI) of 80 today, but remains sedated for extubation. The family has not made a final decision regarding whether they would want to re-intubate if necessary. The patient is also being diures"
