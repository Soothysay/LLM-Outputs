   # Hypotension/shock:  Patient with basline SBPs in the 70s-80s, however
   documented noninvasive SBPs as low as the 50s in ED and in ICU with e/o
   end organ ischemia given elevated lactate, newly elevated
   transaminases, and elevated trop.  Did provide h/o poor PO and
   continued aggressive volume off at HD, but hypotensive unresponsive to
   fluid back.  in the setting of poor PO intake, likely due to
   hypovolemia, but we will rule out septic, cardiac etiologies. Currently
   requiring small dose of levophed to maintain her BP near her baseline
   of systolic 80s. Her lactate was 2.8 today.
   - small IVF boluses
   - wean levophed
   - monitor on tele
   - TTE to eval for pericardial effusion, wall motion abnormalities
   - blood cx pending, urine cx cannot be obtaine(not make urine), CXR and
   CT w/o evidence of PNA
   - received broad spectrum ABx in ED
   - if hypotension resolves w/IVF, plan to hold tomorrow

   # Hypercalcemia: in the setting of diffuse, recurrent MM c/b
   amyloidosis
   - IV pamidronate now
   - calcitonin x 1 dose now
   - IVF w/close monitoring for sx of fluid overload
   - continue HD

   # Respiratory: has chronic oxygen requirement due to amyloidosis
   involvement of the lungs. Also has h/o PEs and is s/p pleurodesis. CTA
   was negative for PE. CT and CXR w/stable chronic findings, no
   suggesition of PNA at this point.
   - wean oxygen as tolerated to home level 2-3 L
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Pt initially presented supratherapeutic at prior
   admission, had been subtherapeutic on discharge, Coumadin dose was
   increased. She has an extensive h/o thromobosis of unclear etiology.
   - hold coumadin, give vitamin K 1 dose
   .
   # Positive cardiac biomarkers: in the setting of worsening renal
   failure. TNI and CK elevated, MB fraction flat.
   - continue ROMI protocol
   - monitor on tele

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple myeloma and systemic amyloidosis who has been admitted to the ICU. She has a history of recurrent disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and a recent hospitalization for hypercalcemia and supratherapeutic INR.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:
1. Hypotension/shock: The patient has been hypotensive, with documented noninvasive systolic blood pressures as low as 50s in the emergency department and ICU. This has resulted in end organ ischemia, as indicated by elevated lactate levels, newly elevated transaminases, and elevated troponin. The patient is requiring a small dose of levophed to maintain her blood pressure near her baseline of systolic 80s. Further evaluation is needed to rule out septic, cardiac etiologies.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has positive cardiac biomarkers, including elevated troponin levels, suggesting acute myocardial injury. This could be related to her hypotension and worsening renal failure.
3. Elevated transaminases: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may be due to her hypotension and end organ ischemia or other underlying causes.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, likely secondary to her recurrent multiple myeloma and associated amyloidosis.
5. Respiratory issues: The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple myeloma, recurrent disease, and systemic amyloidosis who is on hemodialysis. She presents with diffuse bone pain, persistent fatigue, and hypotension requiring levophed. She also has a history of hypercalcemia and supratherapeutic INR. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 104/51 to 137/63 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. The patient's troponin T level continues to rise, indicating a possible NSTEMI. She has wide complex tachycardia, likely ventricular tachycardia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's renal function is worsening, and she is on hemodialysis. She has a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, wide complex tachycardia, NSTEMI, elevated transaminases, hypercalcemia, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is persistently hypotensive, requiring levophed. This may indicate shock,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma, systemic amyloidosis, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. She presents with diffuse bone pain, persistent fatigue, and hypotension requiring vasopressor support.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypotension/ shock: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. This could be due to end-organ ischemia, underlying pneumonia, or cardiogenic causes such as cardiac amyloid and diastolic dysfunction. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) between 50-55 mmHg, and the patient will continue on neo (vasopressor) for now.

2. Wide complex tachycardia: The patient experienced an episode of sustained wide complex tachycardia, which is likely ventricular tachycardia (VT) given the absence of known history of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias or atrial fibrillation. Given her cardiac amyloidosis, VT is a concern, and she has been started on amiodarone loading.

3. NSTEMI: Troponin levels continue to rise, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's hypotension and possible previously unrecognized asymptomatic tachyarrhythmias may contribute to ischemia and acute coronary syndrome. Aspirin has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   64yo woman with multiple myeloma, s/p allogeneic transplant [**2143**] with
   recurrent disease and with systemic amyloidosis(cardiac), ESRD on
   hemodialysis s/p recent hospitalization for hypercalcemia and
   supratherapeutic INR who represents for the same issues as well as
   hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension/shock:  Patient with baseline SBPs in the 70s-80s,
   however documented noninvasive SBPs as low as the 50s in ED and in ICU
   with e/o end organ ischemia given elevated lactate, newly elevated
   transaminases, and elevated trop.  Did provide h/o poor PO and
   continued aggressive volume off at HD, but hypotension unresponsive to
   fluid back.  Other possible cause include underlying pneumonia (good
   specimen sputum is showing GPCs); she is without other clear source of
   infection currently.  Cardiogenic is certainly possible given h/o
   cardiac amyloid and known diastolic dysfunction as well as in setting
   of MI, however echo largely unchanged from prior and without
   significant WMA. Random cortisol appropriately elevated.  Levophed
   changed to neo following wide complex tachycardia.
   - continue neo for now with goal MAPs 50-55
   - monitor on tele
   - continue levofloxacin/vanco
   - checking central venous O2 sat
   .
   # Wide complex tachycardia:  Does not have known h/o SVT, a.
   fib/flutter to suggest SVT with aberrancy.  Given known cardiac
   amyloid, suspect VT and EKG with e/o AV dissociation.  It was slightly
   irregular, but ?
warm up
 phase of VT.  Experienced only small dip in
   BP during episode and was asymptomatic.
   - amiodarone loading now given second episode of sustained stable
   (probable) VT
   .
   # NSTEMI:  Trop continues to rise (negative CK, -MB).  Suspect in the
   setting of demand from hypotension and probable previously
   unrecognized/asymptomatic tachyarrhythmias.  Think less likely VT is
   d/t ischemia and ACS/acute plaque rupture.  TTE yesterday without noted
   WMA.
   -Continue aspirin
   -Continue to trend CEs awaiting trop peak
   .
   # Elevated transaminases:  Continue to rise and suspect d/t shock
   liver.  AP only very mildly elevated and t.bili normal so no e/o
   cholestatic process.  She is also without abdominal pain so as not to
   suggest cholangitis or cholecystitis as underlying cause of infection.
   - continue to monitor LFTs
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: in the setting of diffuse, recurrent MM c/b
   amyloidosis.  Improved s/p IV pamidronate, calcitonin.
   -continue HD
   -continue to monitor levels
   .
   # Increasing oxygen requirement: has chronic oxygen requirement due to
   amyloidosis involvement of the lungs. Also has h/o PEs and is s/p
   pleurodesis. CTA was negative for PE.   Did have some increased
   perihilar opacity on right on CT chest when compared with prior and,
   although not producing much sputum, did produce good specimen which
   shows GPCs.
   -wean oxygen as tolerated to home level 2-3 L
   -continue vanco/zosyn pending senses on GPCs
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Pt initially presented supratherapeutic at prior
   admission, had been subtherapeutic on discharge, Coumadin dose was
   increased upon last discharge. She has an extensive h/o thromobosis of
   unclear etiology.  INR supratherapeutic again on this presentation,
   improved after 1mg PO vitamin K x1.
   - hold coumadin, continue to monitor coags
   .
   # Multiple myeloma: Recurrent; c/b hypercalcemia and amyloidosis
   - heme/onc involved, appreciate their input
   - Continue decadron 20mg daily x5 days (day 1 is [**1-16**])
   - d/w hem/onc possibility of revlimid causing any of the presenting
   issues as above; otherwise plan per hem/onc is to restart revlimid
   .
   # Bone pain:  Given time course, most likely in the setting of
   bisphosphonate during last admission, now s/p additional dose on this
   presentation.  She remains quite uncomfortable.
   - morphine IV prn
   .
   # ESRD on HD: HD today. Pt does not make urine.
   - renal following appreciate their recs
   .
   # h/o PE/DVTs: thought to be due to med effect
   - currently supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # Contrast infiltration: in SC tissues, ~45cc.
   -f/u plastics recs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple myeloma, systemic amyloidosis, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. She presents with hypotension, wide complex tachycardia, and elevated troponin levels indicating a possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Other potential complications include hypercalcemia, elevated transaminases, and chronic oxygen requirement due to lung involvement from amyloidosis.

The patient has a history of recurrent multiple myeloma, cardiac amyloidosis, and previous hospitalization for hypercalcemia. She also has an extensive history of thrombosis of unclear etiology.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/51 mmHg to 137/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. Her physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds bibasilar, no wheezes or rhonchi, right upper extremity with forearm swelling after IV contrast extravasation, and moderate pericardial effusion on echocardiogram.

Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, platelet count of 263 K/uL, creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL, and elevated troponin T levels. Other notable lab values include elevated liver enzymes, hypercalcemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's plan includes continuing neo for hypotension with the goal of maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) between 50-55 mmHg, monitoring on tele, and administering levofloxacin and vancomycin. She is also being given amiodarone for wide complex tachycardia, aspirin for NSTEMI, and vitamin K for coagulopathy. The patient's multiple myeloma treatment will be discussed with the hematology/oncology team, and her bone pain will be managed with morphine IV prn. The patient is on hemodialysis due to end-stage renal disease and has a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis."

   adrenal insufficiency given cortisol of 23. Titrate neo to MAP of 55,
   check cv02, plan to keep volume even with HD. TTE yesterday with
   relatively little change, but with stable ventricular arrhythmia today.
   No evidence of ischemic changes on admission EKG so suspect etiology is
   d/t conduction abnormality from amyloid in context of infection. Will

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a medical history of multiple myeloma and [**Doctor Last Name **] amyloid. She presents with sub-acute progressive dyspnea, hypotension, and refractory hypercalcemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on high-flow oxygen therapy due to decreased oxygen saturation. She has a positive sputum culture indicating new pneumonia and decreased systemic vascular resistance. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/53 to 137/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with elevated levels of creatinine, troponin T, lactate, calcium, and magnesium. The ECG shows ventricular tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypotension, decreased oxygen saturation, and positive sputum culture suggest a risk of respiratory failure due to pneumonia.

2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The presence of ventricular tachycardia on the ECG indicates an existing cardiac arrhythmia. This increases the risk of further arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.

3. Renal Dysfunction: The"

   with e/o end organ ischemia given elevated lactate, newly elevated
   transaminases, and elevated trop.  Did provide h/o poor PO and
   continued aggressive volume off at HD, but hypotension unresponsive to
   fluid back.  Other possible cause include underlying pneumonia (good
   specimen sputum is showing GPCs); she is without other clear source of
   infection currently.  Cardiogenic is certainly possible given h/o
   cardiac amyloid and known diastolic dysfunction as well as in setting

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma, systemic amyloidosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She presents with hypotension, wide complex tachycardia, and elevated troponin levels, suggestive of possible NSTEMI. The patient also has elevated transaminases and an increasing oxygen requirement. She has a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Her INR is supratherapeutic, and she is on Coumadin. The patient has been treated with various medications including amiodarone, levofloxacin, vancomycin, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/ Shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and elevated lactate levels indicate possible end organ ischemia. This could be due to cardiogenic causes such as cardiac amyloidosis, myocardial infarction, or septic shock. Other possible causes include volume depletion or underlying infection.

2. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient experienced a wide complex tachycardia, which could be ventricular tachycardia (VT) or supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. Given her history of cardiac amyloidosis, VT is suspected. Amiodarone was loaded to control the arrhythmia.

3. NSTEMI: The patient's rising troponin levels suggest"
