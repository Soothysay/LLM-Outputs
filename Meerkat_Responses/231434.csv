","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD, and a myeloproliferative disorder. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening hypoxemia and respiratory distress. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 96/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high flow nasal cannula. She is currently being treated for pneumonia and her atrial fibrillation with medications such as lasix, lopressor, and heparin. The patient's labs show leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and elevated troponin levels. A CT angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism, but revealed left lower lobe collapse and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate a risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, there is a potential for recurrent arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring should be performed.
3. Thromboembolic Events: Despite the negative CT angiogram, the patient's elevated troponin levels suggest possible myocardial injury. Regular monitoring for signs of deep vein thrombosis"

   to have a worsening oxygen requirement and afib with RVR.
   .
   1. Hypoxia:  CTA shows bilateral effusions with LLL collapse.  No clear
   infection and no pulmonary edema.  Effusions may be secondary to heart
   failure vs. malignancy given mediastinal lymphadenopathy also seen on
   CT.  She responded to Lasix last evening.  Given pulmonary nodules,
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy and liver lesion, lung malignancy is also
   in the differential.  Pulmonary edema may be causing her hypoxia but
   this is not prominent on CTA.  Infection may be contributing given her
   elevated WBC and low-grade temp on admission. Has pulmonary nodules on
   CT which could represent malignancy
 this has not yet been discussed
   with patient.
   - Lasix 40mg IV X 1
 hold further for now given hypotension
   - F/U echo results
   - Add on BNP
   - ipratropium nebs standing
   - Vanc/Zosyn for HCAP coverage
   - will defer thoracentesis given that this is likely CHF
   - if no improvement, consider bronchoscopy to open collapsed lung
   - ipratropium nebs - will hold on albuterol given tachycardia
   - incentive spirometer
   .
   2. Afib with RVR: may be precipitated by lung etiology given hypoxia.
   Blood pressure is currently stable.  Currently on Diltiazem and
   Metoprolol (Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO BID currently).
   - will give additional PO Metoprolol as tolerated by blood pressure
   - if not controlled by Metoprolol, could consider esmolol if blood
   pressure does not tolerate; could change to 75 TID for more frequent
   dosing
   - echo today
   - continue to hold coumadin given history of falls
   - Continue long-acting diltiazem
   .
   3. Extensive Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: Differential includes
   infection vs. malignancy.  Malignancy may include lung primary, liver,
   breast, colon or lymphoma.  Patient reports negative mammograms and
   recent colonoscopy [**8-31**] with a benign tumor removed at [**Hospital 237**]
   Hospital.  No current signs of infection although patient has low-grade
   temp of 100.9.  Leukocytosis is chronic.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Cancer diagnosis is not likely to be useful in this patient given her
   age and comorbidities but can have the discussion with her family
   .
   4. Leukocytosis: Chronic per records, has not been seen by hematology.
   WBC is up to 30 today.  Pt with low grade temp of 100.9 on admission.
   - consider infectious etiology with blood cultures, repeat UA and
   culture, C. Diff
   - Antibiotics with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   5. Thrombocytosis: continue Hydroxyurea
   .
   6. Hx of Cellulitis: d/c Keflex given antibiotics above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted after falling and experiencing worsening oxygen requirements and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 96/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen.

She has decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, more on the left side, and no crackles or wheezes. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, with bowel sounds present. No rebound tenderness or guarding is observed. The patient has a Foley catheter in place.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 33.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, platelet count of 702, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose of 121 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.04. Other lab values are within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of atrial fibrillation, who was admitted to the ICU for suspected cardiac ischemia. The patient's condition has been unstable, with ongoing tachycardia and hypotension despite multiple interventions. The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has evidence of right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's history of suspected cardiac ischemia, right ventricular dysfunction, and ongoing hypotension, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and recent antibiotic administration suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection, which could lead to septic shock.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory failure and elevated pulmonary artery pressure on echocardiogram may indicate the development of pulmonary edema.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent tachycardia episodes increase the risk of further arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest potential renal dysfunction or failure.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and testing would be necessary to confirm these"

   to have a worsening oxygen requirement and afib with RVR.
   .
   1. Hypoxia:  CTA shows bilateral effusions with LLL collapse.  No clear
   infection and no pulmonary edema.  Effusions may be secondary to heart
   failure vs. malignancy given mediastinal lymphadenopathy also seen on
   CT.  She responded to Lasix last evening.  Given pulmonary nodules,
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy and liver lesion, lung malignancy is also
   in the differential.  Pulmonary edema may be causing her hypoxia but
   this is not prominent on CTA.  Infection may be contributing given her
   elevated WBC and low-grade temp on admission. Has pulmonary nodules on
   CT which could represent malignancy
 this has not yet been discussed
   with patient.  Echo shows diastolic dysfxn
 unknown duration. If
   recently worsened (e.g. from ischemic event) could contribute to
   current sx. BNP markedly elevated to 10K. CE currently flat. WBC count
   trending down on Abx; afebrile. Markedly increased opacity in L lung
   today, still appears atelectasis of lower lobe with ? infiltrate vs.
   fluid in upper lobe.
   - Consider further diuresis if resp status deteriorates
   - ipratropium nebs standing
   - Vanc/Zosyn for HCAP coverage
   - will defer thoracentesis given that this is likely CHF
   - if no improvement, consider bronchoscopy to open collapsed lung
   - ipratropium nebs - will hold on albuterol given tachycardia
   - incentive spirometer
   - Address pulmonary findings with son/patient today
   .
   2. Afib with RVR: may be precipitated by lung etiology given hypoxia.
   Blood pressure is currently stable.  Currently on Metoprolol
   (Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID currently). RVR to 160s overnight
   with minimal response to IV metoprolol x 2 and IV dilt x 1.
   Long-acting dilt stopped for better dose control. Would begin with Q6H
   PO dilt titrated to best rate control that pressures will allow.
   Received 0.25 mg digoxin earlier (due for 2^nd dose given still
   tachycardic)
 this has helped with RVR during prior admission.
   - Will give additional PO Metoprolol as tolerated by blood pressure
   - if not controlled by Metoprolol, could consider esmolol if blood
   pressure does not tolerate
   - Would continue digoxin at 0.125 daily for now
   - Continue to hold coumadin given history of falls
   - Would start dilt 60 PO Q6H and titrate PRN
   .
   3. Extensive Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: Differential includes
   infection vs. malignancy.  Malignancy may include lung primary, liver,
   breast, colon or lymphoma.  Patient reports negative mammograms and
   recent colonoscopy [**8-31**] with a benign tumor removed at [**Hospital 237**]
   Hospital.  No current signs of infection although patient has low-grade
   temp of 100.9.  Leukocytosis is chronic; nearly back to baseline.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Cancer diagnosis is not likely to be useful in this patient given her
   age and comorbidities but should have the discussion with her family
   .
   4. Leukocytosis: Chronic per records, has not been seen by hematology.
   WBC down to 17 today (near baseline).  Pt with low grade temp of 100.9
   on admission, afebrile yesterday.
   - F/U blood, urine cx
   - Antibiotics with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   5. Thrombocytosis: continue Hydroxyurea
   6. Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 1.3 today. Patient may be
   intravascularly dry. Had decreased UOP yesterday with urine lytes in
   pre-renal [**Doctor Last Name 12139**] (FeNa ~0.2%).
   - Consider additional IVF, though would be cautious given increased
   fluid on CXR
   - Monitor volume status, UOP

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 92-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted after a fall and presented with worsening oxygen requirement and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate in the 130s-140s bpm, blood pressure ranging from the 80s to 100s mmHg, respiratory rate of 35-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87% on high-flow nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed bilateral effusions with left lower lobe collapse, but no clear infection or pulmonary edema. There were also mediastinal lymphadenopathies seen on CT scan, which may be secondary to heart failure or malignancy. The echocardiogram showed diastolic dysfunction of unknown duration. The B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was markedly elevated at 10,550.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated blood glucose, and mildly elevated liver enzymes. Her kidney function was noted to be worsening, with a creatinine level of 1.3.

The patient has been started on various medications including metoprolol, diltiazem, Lasix, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 323**]yo F w/hx of afib, MR, TR, COPD who was admitted s/p fall and found
   to have a worsening oxygen requirement and afib with RVR.
   .
   1. Hypoxia:  CTA shows bilateral effusions with LLL collapse.  No clear
   infection and no pulmonary edema.  Effusions may be secondary to heart
   failure vs. malignancy given mediastinal lymphadenopathy also seen on
   CT.  She responded to Lasix last evening.  Given pulmonary nodules,
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy and liver lesion, lung malignancy is also
   in the differential.  Pulmonary edema may be causing her hypoxia but
   this is not prominent on CTA.  Infection may be contributing given her
   elevated WBC and low-grade temp on admission. Has pulmonary nodules on
   CT which could represent malignancy
 this has not yet been discussed
   with patient.  Echo shows diastolic dysfxn
 unknown duration.  BNP
   markedly elevated to 10K. CE currently flat. WBC count trending down on
   Abx; afebrile. Markedly increased opacity in L lung today, still
   appears atelectasis of lower lobe with ? infiltrate vs. fluid in upper
   lobe.
   - 10mg IV lasix and consider lasix gtt based on response
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn
   - ipratropium nebs standing
   - will defer thoracentesis given that this is likely CHF
   - if no improvement, consider bronchoscopy to open collapsed lung
   - incentive spirometer
   - Address pulmonary findings with son/patient today
   .
   2. Afib with RVR: may be precipitated by lung etiology given hypoxia.
   Blood pressure is currently stable.  Currently on Metoprolol
   (Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID currently). RVR to 160s overnight,
   initially 75 mg metoprolol PO x 2, 500 cc NS bolus, with minimal
   response, then IV metoprolol x 2 and IV dilt x 1 still with minimal
   response.  Long-acting dilt stopped for better dose control. Would
   begin with Q6H PO dilt titrated to best rate control that pressures
   will allow.
   - Load with digoxin (0.5 now then 0.5 in divided doses over next 24
   hours), given marginal blood pressure
   - continue metoprolol and diltiazem as tolerated by blood pressure
   - if not controlled by Metoprolol, could consider esmolol if blood
   pressure does not tolerate
   - Continue to hold coumadin given history of falls
   .
   3. Extensive Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: Differential includes
   infection vs. malignancy.  Malignancy may include lung primary, liver,
   breast, colon or lymphoma.  Patient reports negative mammograms and
   recent colonoscopy [**8-31**] with a benign tumor removed at [**Hospital 237**]
   Hospital.  No current signs of infection although patient has low-grade
   temp of 100.9.  Leukocytosis is chronic; nearly back to baseline.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Cancer diagnosis is not likely to be useful in this patient given her
   age and comorbidities but should have the discussion with her family
   .
   4. Leukocytosis: Chronic per records, has not been seen by hematology.
   WBC down to 17 today (near baseline).  Pt with low grade temp of 100.9
   on admission, afebrile yesterday.
   - F/U blood, urine cx
   - Antibiotics with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   5. Thrombocytosis: continue Hydroxyurea
   6. Acute renal failure: Creatinine up to 1.3 today. Patient may be
   intravascularly dry. Had decreased UOP yesterday with urine lytes in
   pre-renal [**Doctor Last Name 12139**] (FeNa ~0.2%).
   - Consider additional IVF, though would be cautious given increased
   fluid on CXR
   - Monitor volume status, UOP
   .
   7. Hx of Cellulitis: d/c Keflex given antibiotics above. 3 lesions on
   LLE unchanged per nursing.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted after falling and experiencing worsening oxygen requirements and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate in the 130s, blood pressure in the 80s, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87% on high-flow nasal cannula. 

Her physical examination findings include mild dryness of the mouth, jugular venous distention at the upper limit of normal, tachycardia, decreased breath sounds at the left base with rales in the left mid-field, soft abdomen without notable tenderness or distension, and no significant peripheral edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and decreased hemoglobin levels. The patient also has an elevated troponin T level, which indicates possible cardiac damage. 

The patient's imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusions, left lower lobe collapse, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 

The patient's current plan includes continued administration of vancomycin and piperacillin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with respiratory distress, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. She has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient was previously hypotensive but became more tachycardic and hypertensive overnight, prompting the addition of digoxin. Her heart rate is currently in the 120s.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including a transesophageal echo, administration of antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin), and various medications such as heparin sodium, metoprolol, and diltiazem.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/53 mmHg to 111/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and has an ABG result of ///27/. The physical examination reveals crackles in both lungs, JVP >10 cm, right and left radial pulses not assessed, right and left DP pulses not assessed, right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, warm skin, and oriented but with limited neurological assessment.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct), normal plate"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 323**]yo F w/hx of afib, MR, TR, COPD who was admitted s/p fall and found
   to have a worsening oxygen requirement and afib with RVR.
   .
   1. Hypoxia:  CTA shows bilateral effusions with LLL collapse.  No clear
   infection and no pulmonary edema.  Effusions may be secondary to heart
   failure vs. malignancy given mediastinal lymphadenopathy also seen on
   CT.  She responded to Lasix last evening.  Given pulmonary nodules,
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy and liver lesion, lung malignancy is also
   in the differential.  Pulmonary edema may be causing her hypoxia but
   this is not prominent on CTA.  Infection may be contributing given her
   elevated WBC and low-grade temp on admission. Has pulmonary nodules on
   CT which could represent malignancy
 this has not yet been discussed
   with patient.  Echo shows diastolic dysfxn
 unknown duration.  BNP
   markedly elevated to 10K. CE currently flat. WBC count trending down on
   Abx; afebrile. Continues with fluid in lungs on CXR although net fluid
   balance negative. Good response to IV Lasix this AM.
   -  Continue IV Lasix 20 [**Hospital1 **] standing to goal net negative ~1L daily
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn for
   - ipratropium nebs standing
   - incentive spirometer
   - Address pulmonary findings with son/patient today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on Lasix
   .
   2. Afib with RVR: may be precipitated by lung etiology given hypoxia.
   Blood pressure is currently stable.  Currently on Metoprolol
   (Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID currently). RVR to 160s [**5-5**],
   initially 75 mg metoprolol PO x 2, 500 cc NS bolus, with minimal
   response, then IV metoprolol x 2 and IV dilt x 1 still with minimal
   response.  Long-acting dilt stopped for better dose control.  Currently
   rate in 80s with SBPs 100-110s.
   - Continue current dosing of dilt, metoprolol, digoxin (appears
   appropriately loaded, will trend level).
   - continue metoprolol and diltiazem as tolerated by blood pressure
   - Continue to hold coumadin given history of falls
   .
   3. Extensive Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: Differential includes
   infection vs. malignancy.  Malignancy may include lung primary, liver,
   breast, colon or lymphoma.  Patient reports negative mammograms and
   recent colonoscopy [**8-31**] with a benign tumor removed at [**Hospital 237**]
   Hospital.  No current signs of infection although patient has low-grade
   temp of 100.9.  Leukocytosis is chronic; nearly back to baseline.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Cancer diagnosis is not likely to be useful in this patient given her
   age and comorbidities but should have the discussion with her family
   .
   4. Leukocytosis: Chronic per records, has not been seen by hematology.
   WBC down to 17 today (near baseline).  Pt with low grade temp of 100.9
   on admission, afebrile yesterday.
   - F/U blood, urine cx
   - Antibiotics with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   5. Thrombocytosis: continue Hydroxyurea 3 days per week
   6. Acute renal failure: Back at baseline today with improved UOP since
   starting Lasix IV.
   - Monitor volume status, UOP
   .
   7. Hx of Cellulitis: d/c Keflex given antibiotics above. 3 lesions on
   LLE unchanged per nursing.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, mitral regurgitation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a fall and worsening oxygen requirement. The patient has several medical complications and potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note.

1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to bilateral effusions with left lower lobe collapse seen on CT scan. This could be secondary to heart failure or malignancy. The patient responded well to Lasix, which suggests that fluid overload was contributing to her hypoxia. However, the presence of pulmonary nodules and liver lesion raises the possibility of lung malignancy.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient's irregular heart rhythm with a rate around 90s is consistent with AFib. It is likely precipitated by the lung etiology given the hypoxia. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and she is currently on metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control. Digoxin has been started and is being monitored.

3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy: The extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy could be due to infection or malignancy. Malignancy may include lung primary, liver, breast, colon, or lymphoma. The patient has negative mammograms and a recent colonoscopy"

   1. Hypoxia:  CTA shows bilateral effusions with LLL collapse.  No clear
   infection and no pulmonary edema.  Effusions may be secondary to heart
   failure vs. malignancy given mediastinal lymphadenopathy also seen on
   CT.  She responded to Lasix last evening.  Given pulmonary nodules,
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy and liver lesion, lung malignancy is also
   in the differential.  Pulmonary edema may be causing her hypoxia but
   this is not prominent on CTA.  Infection may be contributing given her
   elevated WBC and low-grade temp on admission. Has pulmonary nodules on
   CT which could represent malignancy
 this has not yet been discussed
   with patient.  Echo shows diastolic dysfxn
 unknown duration.  BNP
   markedly elevated to 10K. CE currently flat. WBC count trending down on
   Abx; afebrile. Continues with fluid in lungs on CXR although net fluid
   balance negative. Good response to IV Lasix this AM.
   -  Continue IV Lasix PRN to goal net negative ~1L daily

   2. Afib with RVR: may be precipitated by lung etiology given hypoxia.
   Blood pressure is currently stable.  Currently on Metoprolol
   (Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID currently). RVR to 160s [**5-5**],
   initially 75 mg metoprolol PO x 2, 500 cc NS bolus, with minimal
   response, then IV metoprolol x 2 and IV dilt x 1 still with minimal
   response.  Long-acting dilt stopped for better dose control.  Currently
   rate in 80s with SBPs 100-110s.
   - Continue current dosing of dilt, metoprolol, digoxin (appears
   appropriately loaded, will trend level).
   - continue metoprolol and diltiazem as tolerated by blood pressure
   - Continue to hold coumadin given history of falls
   .
   3. Extensive Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: Differential includes
   infection vs. malignancy.  Malignancy may include lung primary, liver,
   breast, colon or lymphoma.  Patient reports negative mammograms and
   recent colonoscopy [**8-31**] with a benign tumor removed at [**Hospital 237**]
   Hospital.  No current signs of infection although patient has low-grade

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted after a fall and found to have worsening oxygen requirement and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient responded to Lasix treatment overnight and showed improvement in respiratory status. Her current medications include digoxin, metoprolol, diltiazem, heparin sodium, and furosemide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be due to bilateral effusions with left lower lobe collapse, possibly secondary to heart failure or malignancy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
2. Pulmonary Edema: Although not prominent on the computed tomography angiography (CTA), pulmonary edema may be contributing to the patient's hypoxia. Fluid management should be closely monitored.
3. Lung Malignancy: The presence of pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy raises the possibility of lung malignancy. This needs to be discussed with the patient and her family, considering her age and comorbidities.
4. Diastolic Dysfunction: The echocardiogram shows diastolic dysfunction of unknown duration. Close monitoring of cardiac function and consideration of additional interventions may be necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of heart failure and recent hospital admission for septic shock. He was diagnosed with right ventricular dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is currently receiving digoxin, metoprolol, diltiazem, lasix, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. He has been improving with controlled heart rate, improved respiratory status, and reduced fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right ventricular dysfunction: The patient's right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis, indicating impaired right ventricular function. This can lead to poor oxygenation and hypotension.
2. Moderate mitral regurgitation: The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation, which can result in volume overload in the left atrium and ventricle, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath and edema.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which can cause right ventricular strain and further deterioration of cardiac function.
4. Fluid overload: Despite the administration of lasix, the patient still has fluid overload, which can increase the risk of pulmonary edema and worsening heart failure.
5. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's platelet count has been decreasing over the course of treatment with heparin sodium, which can lead to HIT, a potentially life-threatening complication characterized by low platelet counts and increased risk of clot formation.
6. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or other infections is crucial.
7. Medication side effects: The patient is on multiple medications, including digoxin and diltiazem, which can have side effects such as arrhythmias, bradycardia, and hypotension. Monitoring for these side effects is important.

These potential medical complications should be closely monitored and managed to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 323**]yo F w/hx of afib, MR, TR, COPD who was admitted s/p fall and found
   to have a worsening oxygen requirement and afib with RVR.
   .
   1. Hypoxia:  CTA shows bilateral effusions with LLL collapse.  No clear
   infection and no pulmonary edema.  Effusions may be secondary to heart
   failure vs. malignancy given mediastinal lymphadenopathy also seen on
   CT.  She responded to Lasix last evening.  Given pulmonary nodules,
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy and liver lesion, lung malignancy is also
   in the differential.  Pulmonary edema may be causing her hypoxia but
   this is not prominent on CTA.  Infection may be contributing given her
   elevated WBC and low-grade temp on admission. Has pulmonary nodules on
   CT which could represent malignancy
 this has not yet been discussed
   with patient.  Echo shows diastolic dysfxn
 unknown duration.  BNP
   markedly elevated to 10K. CE currently flat. WBC count trending down on
   Abx; afebrile. Continues with fluid in lungs on CXR although net fluid
   balance negative. Good response to IV Lasix this AM.
   -  Continue IV Lasix PRN to goal net negative ~1L daily
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn
   - ipratropium nebs standing
   - incentive spirometer
   - Address pulmonary findings with son/patient today
   .
   2. Afib with RVR: may be precipitated by lung etiology given hypoxia.
   Blood pressure is currently stable.  Currently on Metoprolol
   (Metoprolol increased to 75mg PO TID currently). RVR to 160s [**5-5**],
   initially 75 mg metoprolol PO x 2, 500 cc NS bolus, with minimal
   response, then IV metoprolol x 2 and IV dilt x 1 still with minimal
   response.  Long-acting dilt stopped for better dose control.  Currently
   rate in 80s with SBPs 100-110s.
   - Continue current dosing of dilt, metoprolol, digoxin (appears
   appropriately loaded, will trend level).
   - continue metoprolol and diltiazem as tolerated by blood pressure
   - Continue to hold coumadin given history of falls
   .
   3. Extensive Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: Differential includes
   infection vs. malignancy.  Malignancy may include lung primary, liver,
   breast, colon or lymphoma.  Patient reports negative mammograms and
   recent colonoscopy [**8-31**] with a benign tumor removed at [**Hospital 237**]
   Hospital.  No current signs of infection although patient has low-grade
   temp of 100.9.  Leukocytosis is chronic; nearly back to baseline.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Cancer diagnosis is not likely to be useful in this patient given her
   age and comorbidities but should have the discussion with her family
   .
   4. Leukocytosis: Chronic per records, has not been seen by hematology.
   WBC down to 17 today (near baseline).  Pt with low grade temp of 100.9
   on admission, afebrile yesterday.
   - F/U blood, urine cx
   - Antibiotics with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   5. Thrombocytosis: continue Hydroxyurea 3 days per week
   6. Acute renal failure: Back at baseline today with improved UOP since
   starting Lasix IV.
   - Monitor volume status, UOP
   .
   7. Hx of Cellulitis: d/c Keflex given antibiotics above. 3 lesions on
   LLE unchanged per nursing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted after falling and experiencing worsening oxygen requirements and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has been treated with various medications including digoxin, metoprolol, diltiazem, and Lasix. She also received antibiotics for an infection. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she continues to experience hypoxia and respiratory issues. Imaging tests reveal bilateral effusions with left lower lobe collapse, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a liver lesion. The differential diagnosis includes heart failure, malignancy, pulmonary edema, infection, and lung malignancy. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has leukocytosis. There is also evidence of thrombocytosis and acute renal failure, which has improved with Lasix therapy. The patient has a history of cellulitis, and her code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) but okay to intubate. The patient is currently in the ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate a potential respiratory issue, which can be caused by pulmonary edema, infection, or lung malignancy.
2. Atrial fibrillation with"
