   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with coffee ground
   emesis.
   Septic Shock: Patient with significant white count . WBC on [**10-31**] 10.2.
   on levophed. GI likely given mesenteric ischemia, lung source possible
   given emesis and aspiration, necrotic toes as well, dont appear
   infected right now. Lactate trending down
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now in setting of multiple
   drug resident organisms with vancomycin with HD, zosyn, gentamycin,
   azithromycin. (day 1: [**11-4**])
   - f/u  blood cultures
   - stool for c diff, and treat empirically for now with PO vanc and IV
   flagyl
   - sputum culture
   - lactates trending down
   - wean levophed as tolerated, 0.14 this AM.
   - Use vigileo to assess stroke volume variation and fluid status. As of
   this afternoon, SVV 11, so appears euvolemic. Will hold off further
   boluses.
   Ischemic Bowel: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on CT scan. Surgery is
   following, do not recommend surgery at this time
   - fluid recuscutation, broad spectrum abx
   - Lactate trending down
   - will have ongoing discussions with the family.
   - NPO
   - morphine for pain control
   Upper GI bleed: coffee ground emesis, lavage still coffee ground.
   currently hct is stable,  but blood pressure is trending down.
   Considering ulcer, gastritis, GI malignancy given has hx of colon CA,
   AVM, [**Doctor First Name 1856**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] in setting of emesis.
   - GI consult appreciated: will wait until stable to scope
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - NPO
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline. now responsive
   to noxious stimuli. per aide in room she usually moves extremities.
   differential includes old stroke, current infection, hypernatremia,
   morphine and ativan given in the ED
   - Hypernatremia: resolved
   - Infection: abx
   - Medications: will hold narcotics for now
   COPD/Respiratory : On AC for now. will wean off when mental status
   improves. oxygenating well. Has underlying COPD
   - follow gasses
   - albuterol, atrovent, fluticasone inhalers.
   ESRD: last HD was Monday. MWF. etiology is likely HTN. currently
   appears euvolemic.
   - indication for acute dialysis or CVVH is volume overload. Since
   electrolytes normal, will put on dialysis vs CVVH if overloaded
   tomorrow.
   Metabolic Alkalosis: Bicarb 29 on admission likely in setting of
   emesis, now normalized to 22.
   - will  monitor
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, now is 36, likely hemoconcentrated. MCV
   >100. on thiamine folate at home
   - will check Hct [**Hospital1 **] today
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   - check TSH
   Access: Right femoral line and left arm a line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and coffee ground emesis. She was admitted with septic shock, evidence of mesenteric ischemia, and ischemic bowel on CT scan. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and her lactate levels are trending down. She is also being evaluated for potential upper GI bleed, with a history of colon cancer and arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The patient's mental status is responsive to noxious stimuli, and she has a history of COPD, hypernatremia, and hypothyroidism. She is currently euvolemic with stable hemodynamics. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and dialysis catheter, and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The family does not currently want to discuss palliative care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic bowel: The patient's CT scan shows findings highly concerning for mesenteric ischemia and ischemic bowel in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) territory. Surgical consultation is recommended, and the patient is currently receiving fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Upper GI bleed: The patient has coffee ground emesis, indicating possible ongoing bleeding from the upper GI tract"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock, suspected ischemic bowel, and a recent GI bleed. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic bowel: The patient has pneumotosis bowel on CT scan, which indicates compromised blood flow to the intestines. Surgery is being planned to address this issue. The patient is at risk for further bowel ischemia and potential necrosis.
2. GI bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleeds, and the recent coffee ground emesis suggests ongoing upper GI bleeding. She may require endoscopic intervention once stabilized.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, high lactate levels, and positive findings on blood cultures indicate a systemic infection. There is a concern for multi-drug resistant organisms, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a history of hypernatremia, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient has underlying COPD, and her mental status changes could be attributed to hypercapnia. Oxygenation and"

   2. Small amount of ascites.
   3. Bilateral small pleural effusion, left lower lobe collapse.
   4. Cholelithiasis; gallbladder distention can be related to the fasting
   state.
   CT head: prelim report with no acute findings\
   CXR with retrocardiac opacity.
   Assessment and Plan
   72-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure in the
   setting of a complicated prior medical history.  CT strongly suggests
   mesenteric ischemia, but with resuscitation she has improved.
   Septic shock
   Ischemic bowel with translocation is most likely, though she may have
   multiple etiologies.
   Antibiotics
          High risk for MRSA
 vancomycin IV
          High risk for C diff and quite ill
 vancomycin enteral;
   Flagyl IV
          Known resistant GNRs
 gentamicin + Zosyn (culture data
   reviewed)
          High risk for anaerobic trasnolaction
 Flagyl
          Some risk for atypicals (either as coinfection or primary
   CAP pathogen), given PNA findings on
            CT
  azithro
         Likely begin tapering tomorrow
   Hemodynamics
         Appears adequately volume resuscitated
         Continue levophed; wean as tolerated
         Decreasing lactate is reassuring
          Steroids only if vasopressor-resistant hypotension
          GI bleed makes risks of drotrecogin greater than benefits
   GI bleed
   This seems to have stopped at present and may be due to ischemia.  Will
   give PPI and blood product support as needed
   Respiratory failure
   Leave supported while in shock state
   Very difficult vascular access
   We placed a right femoral CVL with single attempt.  As noted in exam
   above, the typical sites were not amenable to percutaneous placement.
   Also performed ultrasound exam of axillary veins (anteriorly).  These
   appeared quite small and not easily approachable.  Left radial arterial
   line was placed by ultrasound
   Mental status
   Somewhat improved today.
   ESRD on HD
   Dialysis per renal; will likely need CVVHD
   Other issues as per the ICU team note from today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure. She has a complicated medical history and is currently critically ill. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 109/43 to 61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 96%. 

The patient has been on various medications including norepinephrine, heparin sodium, vancomycin, azithromycin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and flagyl IV, among others. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, increased creatinine, elevated troponin T, and other abnormalities in kidney and liver function tests. 

Imaging studies reveal findings highly concerning for mesenteric ischemia and ischemic bowel in the superior mesenteric artery territory. There is also a small amount of ascites, bilateral small pleural effusion, left lower lobe collapse, and cholelithiasis. 

The assessment and plan include treating septic shock, ischemic bowel, and respiratory failure. Antibiotics have been adjusted based on culture data and resistance patterns. The patient is adequately volume resuscitated, and vasopressor support will"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Findings highly concerning for mesenteric ischemia and ischemic
   bowel in
   the SMA territory.
   2. Small amount of ascites.
   3. Bilateral small pleural effusion, left lower lobe collapse.
   4. Cholelithiasis; gallbladder distention can be related to the fasting
   state.
   CT head: prelim report with no acute findings\
   CXR with retrocardiac opacity.
   Assessment and Plan
   72-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure in the
   setting of a complicated prior medical history.  CT strongly suggests
   mesenteric ischemia, but with resuscitation she has improved.
   Septic shock
   Ischemic bowel with translocation is most likely
   Antibiotics
          High risk for MRSA
 vancomycin IV
          High risk for C diff and quite ill
 vancomycin enteral;
   Flagyl IV
          Known resistant GNRs
 gentamicin + Zosyn (culture data
   reviewed)
          Some risk for atypicals (either as coinfection or primary
   CAP pathogen)
 azithromycing
   Hemodynamics
          EGDT as feasible through a femoral CVL (CVP > 12, MAP >
   60-65, etc.)
          Steroids only if vasopressor-resistant hypotension
          GI bleed makes risks of drotrecogin greater than benefits
   Diagnostics
          Follow cultures including sputum, blood, urine cx and
   Legionella urinary Ag if she makes urine.
          KUB and upright chest.  CT abdomen given abnormal exam, once
   hemodynamics stabilized
   GI bleed
   This seems to have stopped at present.  We will give PPI and blood
   product support as needed.  Will consult GI as she may warrant EGD
   before discharge, but unless she shows [**Year (4 digits) **] bleeding I would not
   pursue until hemodynamics improved.
   Respiratory failure
   Put on triggered mode to reduce WOB.  Seems likely secondary to
   aspiration and shock state.
   Very difficult vascular access
   We placed a right femoral CVL with single attempt.  As noted in exam
   above, the typical sites were not amenable to percutaneous placement.
   Also performed ultrasound exam of axillary veins (anteriorly).  These
   appeared quite small and not easily approachable.
   Left radial arterial line placed by me with single pass under real-time
   ultrasound guidance, using full barrier precautions.  Prior attempts by
   housestaff unsuccessful.
   Mental status
   Eye findings are concerning and not previously documented.  Response to
   noxious stimuli suggests that non-convulsive status is unlikely.  [**Month (only) 60**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure. The note details her medical history, physical examination findings, laboratory results, imaging studies, and the plan of care. 

From the note, several potential medical complications can be identified:

1. Mesenteric ischemia and ischemic bowel: The CT scan findings are highly concerning for mesenteric ischemia in the SMA (superior mesenteric artery) territory. This condition involves reduced blood flow to the intestines, which can lead to tissue damage and necrosis.

2. Bilateral small pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse: The CT scan also reveals the presence of a small amount of fluid in the pleural space around the lungs, as well as collapse of the left lower lobe. These findings suggest a possible infection or fluid accumulation that may require further evaluation and treatment.

3. Cholelithiasis: The CT scan shows gallbladder distention, which may be related to the fasting state. Cholelithiasis refers to the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder, which can cause pain and complications if they obstruct the bile ducts.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is on ventilatory support due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to aspiration and shock state. This indicates a significant impairment in lung function and the need for mechanical ventilation to support breathing.

5. Septic shock: The patient is diagnosed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and has positive blood cultures for gram-positive bacilli. She has necrotic toes but no signs of infection at the moment. Her lactate levels are trending down.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for gram-positive bacilli, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further speciation and specific antibiotic therapy will be tailored accordingly.
2. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient's CT scan shows evidence of pneumotosis bowel, suggesting mesenteric ischemia. Surgery is being followed, but no surgery is recommended at this time. Fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which has resolved. It should be monitored carefully to prevent its recurrence.
4. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status is altered, with verbal responsiveness only. Differential diagnoses include old stroke, current infection, hypernatremia, morphine, and ativan given in the ED. Medications will be used cautiously.
5. COPD/Respiratory: The patient has underlying COPD"

   Assessment and Plan
   72F with ESRD p/w mesenteric ischemia, septic shock, and respiratory
   failure.
   1) Septic Shock:  Secondary to mesenteric ischemia and pneumonia.
       -Continue broad spectrum abx for now with specific coverage for
   possible C. perfrigens bacteremia.
       -SVV indicates adequate preload currently so likely would not
   benefit from additional fluid challenge.
       -Wean pressors as tolerated, MAP>65.
   2) Mesenteric ischemia:
      -Maintain adequate perfusion
      -D/w surgery and GI if any role of anticoagulation.
   3) Respiratory Failure:
      -Continue current ventilator settings until shock/mesenteric
   ischemia improves.
      -Recheck ABG
   4) Renal failure:
      -Metabolic acidosis>>begin CVVH.
      -Run CVVH at fluid goal of even.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with mesenteric ischemia, septic shock, and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being weaned off pressors as tolerated, with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65. The patient's mesenteric ischemia is being managed by maintaining adequate perfusion, and there is consideration for surgery and gastrointestinal consultation regarding anticoagulation.

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed by continuing current ventilator settings until improvement in shock and mesenteric ischemia. The patient's renal failure is being managed by initiating continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to address metabolic acidosis and fluid overload.

In terms of ICU care, the patient will begin total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and will have a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines, including a dialysis catheter, multi-lumen catheter, and arterial line.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Further deterioration of renal function
2. Development of multi-drug resistant infections due to broad-spectrum antibiotic use
3. Complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
4. Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, due to the stress of septic shock and underlying"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. She has been diagnosed with Corynebacterium diptheroids sepsis and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock due to Corynebacterium diptheroids sepsis. This condition can lead to hypotension, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient has evidence of mesenteric ischemia, which can lead to bowel necrosis and perforation. Surgery is being considered to address this issue.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation and has underlying COPD. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging, and there is a risk of respiratory failure.
4. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeds, and it is difficult to determine the exact source. Continued monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent further bleeding.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD is likely contributing to her current condition. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been initiated, but the patient's BUN levels are increasing, indicating ongoing renal dysfunction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. The patient's current condition includes septic shock with a high white blood cell count, GI source likely due to mesenteric ischemia, lung source possible due to emesis and aspiration, and necrotic toes. The patient also has hypotension, dilated loops of bowel on imaging, and an elevated lactate level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a severe infection causing systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Immediate management includes administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and supportive care.

2. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient has evidence of mesenteric ischemia, which is a condition where there is reduced blood flow to the intestines. This can lead to bowel necrosis and perforation if not promptly treated. Surgical intervention may be necessary, but the risks may outweigh the benefits in this patient's case.

3. Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation: The patient has been on prolonged mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory complications. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and implementing daily wake"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diphtheroids, likely originating from a GI source due to mesenteric ischemia and possible lung source due to emesis and aspiration. The patient has been on levophed, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and flagyl 500mg IV q8. Her lactate levels are trending up. She also has atrial fibrillation, which has been present since November 7th. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to infection, hypernatremia, morphine, and ativan. She has a history of COPD, upper GI bleed, anemia, hypothyroidism, and is currently NPO. Her access includes right femoral line and left arm a-line. Code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she is on TPN without lipids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
2. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient's condition indicates mesenteric ischemia, which can result in bowel necrosis and perforation if not promptly addressed.
3. Pneumonia: Aspiration during altered mental status can lead to pneumonia, a common complication in critically ill patients.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged ventilator use increases the risk of developing VAP.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can predispose the patient to developing DVT.
6. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and sepsis can cause stress ulcers in the stomach, leading to GI bleeding.
7. Renal failure: Due to ESRD and potential complications from sepsis and mesenteric ischemia, the patient may experience worsening renal function or acute kidney injury.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and prolonged ventilator dependence increase the risk of respiratory failure.
9. Malnutrition: Being NPO for several days, the patient is at risk of malnutrition, which can impair healing and recovery.

Please note that the patient's condition may change rapidly, and this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided at the time of the progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She presented with septic shock due to Corynebacterium diptheroids sepsis. The patient has several medical complications including atrial fibrillation, COPD, anemia, hypothyroidism, and is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death if not promptly treated.
2. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient has evidence of mesenteric ischemia, which can result in bowel necrosis and perforation.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke.
4. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeds, which can recur and lead to significant blood loss and anemia.
5. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has underlying COPD, and her respiratory status may deteriorate further, potentially requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
6. Infection: Given her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay, the patient is at risk of developing additional infections.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's pre-existing E"

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Septic Shock: The patient is suffering from Corynebacterium diphtheriae sepsis, leading to septic shock. The source of infection is likely from the GI tract due to mesenteric ischemia and the lungs due to emesis and aspiration. She has had two episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the 50s-60s. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, Zosyn, gentamicin, and Flagyl.

2. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient has evidence of mesenteric ischemia, as shown by pneumotosis intestinalis on a CT scan. Surgery is considering re-imagining the abdomen with a CT angiography of the superior mesenteric artery if the patient remains stable without escalating pressors. A Dopplerable pulse was present on admission, and the mottled appearance is improving.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation since November 7th. She has a history of atrial fibrillation in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities. She is"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and elevated lactate levels. The microbiology report indicates the presence of gram-negative rods, gram-positive rods, and gram-positive cocci in pairs. 

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, COPD, hypernatremia, ESRD, and a history of colon cancer with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, digoxin for atrial fibrillation, and stress dose steroids. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Infection: The patient has septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and there is evidence of multiple drug-resistant organisms. It is crucial to monitor the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. She is currently in the ICU due to septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae infection, and is on mechanical ventilation. She has several medical complications including atrial fibrillation, COPD, anemia, hypothyroidism, and hypernatremia. She also has a history of colon cancer, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and is on chronic anticoagulation therapy with heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SVC Syndrome: The patient has concerns for superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome due to the presence of a dialysis catheter not withdrawing properly, leading to facial and upper extremity edema. This condition occurs when there is obstruction of the SVC, resulting in impaired blood flow from the head, neck, and upper extremities back to the heart.

2. Clot in the Dialysis Catheter: The patient's dialysis catheter has a fibrin clot at the end, which may affect the effectiveness of dialysis and increase the risk of infection.

3. Stenosis of Right Subclavian Vein: The patient has stenosis of the right subclavian vein at the junction, which can further worsen"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Concern for SVC syndrome given dialysis catheter not withdrawing,
   increasing facial and upper extremity edema, so CT chest obtained:
   question of fibrin at end of catheter, clot in common jugular
   (appearing old), and stenosis of right subclavian vein at junction.
   - CT abdomen obtained while patient getting CT chest--demonstrated
   illeus, no other new acute findings
   - Upon return from CT, tachycardic to 150's-160's. Gave digoxin 0.0625
   mg IV, small dose of morphine for pain, HR improved to 80-90's, was
   briefly off levophed, then started back at lower dose (0.1mg/kg/min)
   - IR consulted, planning to change dialysis line today, possibly take
   out fibrin clot if possible; IR team spoke with son with plan, son
   requesting mucomyst if possible prior to procedure.
   - Plan to re-start CVVH after line exchanged.
   - Added sensitivities to pseudomonas and corynebacterium given
   corynebacterium was intermediate to gentamicin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis and septic shock. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, gentamicin, metronidazole, and piperacillin. The patient has a history of SVC syndrome, and a CT scan revealed a fibrin clot at the end of the dialysis catheter, an old clot in the common jugular vein, and stenosis of the right subclavian vein at the junction. The IR team plans to change the dialysis line today, possibly remove the fibrin clot if possible. The patient also has an ileus and is receiving CVVH.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SVC Syndrome: The patient's pre-existing SVC syndrome could worsen if the fibrin clot at the end of the dialysis catheter is not addressed. Stenosis of the right subclavian vein may also contribute to the obstruction of blood flow.
2. Clot in Common Jugular Vein: The presence of an old clot in the common jugular vein indicates a risk of further clot formation and potential embolization.
3. Dialysis Catheter Issues: The fibrin clot at the end of the dialysis catheter may interfere with adequate dialysis function, leading to inadequate clearance of toxins and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Ileus: The patient's current ileus may delay bowel"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Concern for SVC syndrome given dialysis catheter not withdrawing,
   increasing facial and upper extremity edema, so CT chest obtained:
   question of fibrin at end of catheter, clot in common jugular
   (appearing old), and stenosis of right subclavian vein at junction.
   - CT abdomen obtained while patient getting CT chest--demonstrated
   illeus, no other new acute findings
   - Upon return from CT, tachycardic to 150's-160's. Gave digoxin 0.0625
   mg IV, small dose of morphine for pain, HR improved to 80-90's, was
   briefly off levophed, then started back at lower dose (0.1mg/kg/min)
   - IR consulted, planning to change dialysis line today, possibly take
   out fibrin clot if possible; IR team spoke with son with plan, son
   requesting mucomyst if possible prior to procedure.
   - Plan to re-start CVVH after line exchanged.
   - Added sensitivities to pseudomonas and corynebacterium given
   corynebacterium was intermediate to gentamicin.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. The patient's current condition includes septic shock due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, pneumonia, and GI bleed. 

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for the suspected multi-drug resistant gram-negative infection. The source of infection is likely from the GI tract or lungs. Blood cultures have grown Diptheria, sensitive to vancomycin, and sputum has grown Pseudomonas sensitive to gentamicin. Surveillance cultures will be followed up.

The patient also has mesenteric ischemia with evidence of pneumotosis bowel on initial CT scan, but none now. Surgery is planned, and the utility of surgery will be re-evaluated daily with the family. Heparin therapy for mesenteric ischemia is contraindicated in this case.

Other conditions include atrial fibrillation since November 7th, COPD, hypernatremia (resolved), anemia (likely due to chronic kidney disease), hypothyroidism (on levothyroxine), and a history of colon cancer, arteriovenous malformation (AVM).

The patient is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for COPD exacerbation. The plan"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to severe sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient underwent PEG tube insertion, arterial line placement, and received multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, gentamicin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), metronidazole, and piperacillin. The patient is on various infusions including norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), and potassium chloride (CRRT). He is also receiving prophylactic heparin sodium, pantoprazole (Protonix), and morphine sulfate.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/62 mmHg to 106/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is mechanically ventilated with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, set with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 168, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 11 L/min.

The patient's blood work reveals elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.5 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hct) of 21.6%, slightly low platelet count (Plt) of 264 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 28 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.8 mg/dL, total bilirubin (T Bili) of 2.4 mg/dL, and low albumin level of 2.6 g/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are as follows: sodium (Na+) of 138 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 3.8 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 101 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 8.9 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.3 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) of 2.4 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and fluid overload due to excessive fluid administration. Additionally, the patient's low platelet count and elevated creatinine levels indicate possible organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to manage these potential complications and optimize the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here mesenteric ischemia
   and septic shock
   Septic Shock: Corynbacterium dipthroid sepsis. On levophed, transiently
   off. GI source likely given mesenteric ischemia, lung source possible
   given emesis and aspiration.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now in setting of multiple
   drug resident organisms with vancomycin (risk of MRSA), zosyn and
   gentamycin (for hx of resistent gram -), and flagyl 500mg IV q8.  (day
   1: [**11-4**]).
   - treat for 2 week course for Bacteremia and VAP
   - Diptheria Bacteremia: blood culture from [**11-4**] , vancomycin (day 1:
   [**11-4**])
   - VAP: pseudomonas sensitive to gent and Zosyn(day 1L [**11-4**])
   - f/u surveillence cultures
   - ID consult appreciated, they signed off, will call back with
   questions ([**Location (un) **])
   - stool for c diff
   - wean levophed as tolerated, use as needed to take off volume with
   CVVH
   - stress dose steroids, hydrocort 50mg IV q6h. (day 1: [**11-8**]), will stop
   once off pressors
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan yesterday. Now making STOOL
   - fluid recuscutation, broad spectrum abx
   - on TPN
   - morphine for pain control
   - daily KUB: no free air so far
   - GI replaced PEG
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving.
   - minimize use of levophed, lowers blood flow to LE
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - On digoxin with some improvement, will check  level and dose prn
   ESRD: last HD was Monday. MWF. CVVH catheter replaced10/6, back on
   CVVH.
   - will try to take fluid off today given significant edema.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. per aide in room she usually
   moves extremities.
   - Hypernatremia: resolved
   - Infection: abx
   - Medications: will use narcotics with caution
   COPD/Respiratory : On AC for now. will wean off when mental status
   improves. oxygenating well. Has underlying COPD. Peak pressures have
   been high, so decreased tV to 55o, and increased rate.  Will continue
   at this rate, not ovebreathing vent PC)2 48.
   - follow gasses
   - albuterol, atrovent, fluticasone inhalers.
   Upper GI bleed: resolved. Admitted with coffee ground emesis. Pulled
   out foley in peg tract [**11-10**]. No obvious active bleeding.
   - GI consult appreciated: will wait until stable to scope
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, now is 36, likely hemoconcentrated. MCV
   >100. on thiamine folate at home
   - will check Hct daily
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
    FEN: TPN
   Access: Right femoral line and new R radial a-line, L tunneled HD

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an attenuated appearance of the right brachiocephalic vein and eccentric clot in the common right jugular vein, indicating possible stenosis. The patient has patent left brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava (SVC), with a central venous catheter in place. Other findings include ascites, bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis, and ileus without evidence of obstruction or pneumotosis. The patient is on multiple antibiotics, including cefepime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, meropenem, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tobramycin. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and has a multi-lumen central venous line, dialysis catheter, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Venous thrombosis/stenosis due to the eccentric clot in the right jugular vein.
2. Infection due to prolonged central venous catheterization and antibiotic usage.
3. Respiratory distress/failure due to bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
4. Hepatic dysfunction/choledoch"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. The patient is currently admitted with septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diptheriae in the blood and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum. 

The patient's current medications include broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin), Flagyl, diptheria bacteremia treatment (vancomycin), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treatment (gentamicin and Zosyn), and stress dose steroids.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7 C (98.1 F)
- Heart rate: 86 bpm (83-127 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 57/43 mmHg (50/47-83/63 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (12-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on ventilator

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 16.1 K/uL (22.6 K/uL - 24.0 K/uL)
- Hematocrit: 22.3% (23.2% - 27"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here mesenteric ischemia
   and septic shock
   Septic Shock: Corynbacterium dipthroid in blood, pseudomonas in sputum.
   back on levophed. GI source likely given mesenteric ischemia.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics for now in setting of multiple
   drug resident organisms with vancomycin (risk of MRSA), zosyn and
   gentamycin (for hx of resistent gram -), and flagyl 500mg IV q8.  (day
   1: [**11-4**]).
   - treat for 2 week course for Bacteremia and VAP
   - Diptheria Bacteremia: blood culture from [**11-4**] , vancomycin (day 1:
   [**11-4**])
   - VAP: pseudomonas sensitive to gent and Zosyn(day 1L [**11-4**])
   - f/u surveillence cultures
   - ID consult appreciated, they signed off, will call back with
   questions ([**Location (un) **])
   - stool for c diff negative
   - wean levophed as tolerated, use as needed to take off volume with CVV
   - stress dose steroids, hydrocort 50mg IV q6h. (day 1: [**11-8**]), will stop
   once off pressors
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan yesterday. Now making STOOL
   - fluid recuscutation, broad spectrum abx
   - on TPN
   - morphine for pain control
   - daily KUB: no free air so far
   - GI replaced PEG
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving.
   - minimize use of levophed, lowers blood flow to LE
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - On digoxin with some improvement, will check  level and dose prn
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced10/6, back on CVVH.
   - will try to take fluid off today given significant edema.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. per aide in room she usually
   moves extremities.
   - Hypernatremia: resolved
   - Infection: abx
   - Medications: will use narcotics with caution
   COPD/Respiratory : On AC for now. will wean off when mental status
   improves. oxygenating well. Has underlying COPD. Peak pressures have
   been high, so decreased tV to 55o, and increased rate.  Will continue
   at this rate, not ovebreathing vent PCo2 48.
   - follow gasses
   - albuterol, atrovent, fluticasone inhalers.
   Upper GI bleed: resolved. Admitted with coffee ground emesis. Pulled
   out foley in peg tract [**11-10**]. No obvious active bleeding.
   - GI consult appreciated: will wait until stable to scope
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, now is 36, likely hemoconcentrated. MCV
   >100. on thiamine folate at [**Last Name (un) **]
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Septic Shock: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient has evidence of mesenteric ischemia, which is a condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the intestines. Surgery is being considered, and the patient is currently receiving fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots and stroke. The patient is on digoxin, and their medication level and dose need to be monitored.

4. ESRD (End-Stage Renal Disease): The patient has chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. They are currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

5. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status has fluctuated, and they are currently responsive only to noxious stimuli. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient initially had high levels of sodium in their blood, which has since resolved.

7. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including bacteremia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She presented with septic shock due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in her blood and sputum, respectively. The patient's white blood cell count has been trending up, and she is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and gentamicin. She also has a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, COPD, anemia, hypothyroidism, and is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen central venous catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's lab results show elevated fibrinogen, d-dimer, and FDP levels, indicating a possible early stage of DIC. DIC is a serious condition that can lead to multiple organ failure if not managed promptly.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing her risk for VAP. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been identified in her s"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae in the blood and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 30.0 K/uL, and she has a high fever. She is on multiple medications including antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole), sedatives (morphine), and cardiovascular drugs (norepinephrine, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe infection leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction. Immediate treatment is required to manage her vital signs, administer appropriate antibiotics, and support organ function.

2. Multi-Organ Dysfunction: Due to the severity of her infection and pre-existing comorbidities, the patient may develop multi-organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory values, and organ-specific functions (such as renal function, hepatic function, respiratory function) will be necessary to prevent or manage complications.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She presented with septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae in the blood and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atrial fibrillation, anemia, mental status changes, and upper GI bleed. She is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and hemodialysis. The patient's prognosis is poor, and she has been discussed in interdisciplinary rounds with a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection: The patient is already infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common cause of hospital-acquired infections and can lead to pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, she is at risk of developing VAP. This is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are receiving mechanical ventilation.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which is an abnormal heart rhythm that can increase the risk of blood"

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. She has been diagnosed with septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae in the blood and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 60/50 mmHg to 83/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and atrial fibrillation. 

The patient is currently receiving several medications including norepinephrine, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate. She is also on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to her inability to eat orally.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (28.2 K/uL), hemoglobin (8.3 g/dL), blood urea nitrogen (117 mg/dL), creatinine (1.1), glucose (141 mg/dL), and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 3764 ng/mL. Her blood cultures have grown Corynebacterium diphtheriae"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She was admitted with septic shock due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia, as well as pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has a history of atrial fibrillation, anemia, hypothyroidism, and upper GI bleed. The patient's current condition includes multi-lumen central venous catheter, right femoral line, radial arterial line, and tunneled hemodialysis catheter. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation. She is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a DNR code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has pseudomonas VAP, which requires continued treatment with meropenem and gentamicin.
2. Septic shock: The patient is still in septic shock and requires ongoing management with vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient's mesenteric ischemia requires further evaluation and potential surgery. She is at risk for bowel perforation and necrosis.
4. Dialysis catheter infection: The patient's dial"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   Septic Shock: Corynbacterium dipthroid in blood, pseudomonas in sputum.
   Still on levophed. GI source likely given mesenteric ischemia on
   admission. WBC count up.
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]) day 2, continue
   gentamycin (day 1 [**11-4**]): day 12
   - Pseudomonas not as sensitive to zosyn ([**Date range (1) 5933**])
   - Diptheria Bacteremia: blood culture from [**11-4**] , vancomycin (day 1:
   [**11-4**]) day 13
   - C. diff: PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, negative x2, but very high
   risk.
   - treat for 2 week course for Bacteremia and VAP
   - f/u surveillence cultures
   - ID consult appreciated
   - as wean levophed tolerated, use as needed to take off volume with
   CVVH
   - s/p stress dose steroids ([**Date range (1) 5922**])
   - gave 1 unit PRBCS [**11-14**], increasing pressor requirement and mottled
   feet.
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan yesterday. Was making stool, but
   getting less and having a lot of output from Gtube. Possibly
   obstructed, or still has ileus.
   - fluid recuscutation, broad spectrum abx
   - on TPN
   - morphine for pain control
   - daily KUB: no free air so far
   - GI replaced PEG
   COPD/Respiratory: On AC for now. will wean off when mental status
   improves. oxygenating well. Has underlying COPD.
   Currently stable AC 550/20/5/50%
   - SBT today
   - albuterol, atrovent inhalers.
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced10/6, back on CVVH.
   - Patient 2L negative from yesterday, will try to take fluid off today
   given significant edema as long as blood pressure tolerates.
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming
   - minimize use of levophed, lowers blood flow to LE
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Dig 0.125mg IV qOD
   - check levels daily
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transused yesterday.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   Upper GI bleed: resolved. Admitted with coffee ground emesis. Pulled
   out foley in peg tract [**11-10**]. No obvious active bleeding.
   - GI consult appreciated: will wait until stable to scope
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   FEN: TPN

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. The patient was admitted with septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae in the blood and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated with meropenem and gentamicin.
2. Diphtheria bacteremia: The patient is being treated with vancomycin.
3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff): The patient is at high risk for C. diff infection, and prophylaxis with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole is being given.
4. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient has evidence of mesenteric ischemia, which may require surgery. Heparin is contraindicated due to the risk of bleeding.
5. COPD/respiratory: The patient is on assisted controlled ventilation (AC) and will be weaned off when mental status improves. Oxygenation is good.
6. ESRD: The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).
7. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD): The patient has mott"

","The patient is a 25-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. He has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. The patient has a history of intravenous drug use and a recent episode of infective endocarditis. He presented with fever, chills, and hypotension, and was found to have widespread microthrombi in the small pulmonary arteries consistent with septic pulmonary emboli.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 89 bpm (within normal range), blood pressure of 69/53 mmHg (hypotensive), respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (elevated), oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2, and sinus rhythm on telemetry.

The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, gentamicin, meropenem, and metronidazole), anticoagulants (heparin sodium and warfarin), vasopressors (norepinephrine), sedatives (propofol and morphine sulfate), and other medications for glucose control, stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and sepsis management.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, D-dimer, and liver enzymes"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   Septic Shock: Corynbacterium dipthroid in blood, pseudomonas in sputum.
   Still on levophed. GI source likely given mesenteric ischemia on
   admission. WBC count up.
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]) day 2, continue
   gentamycin (day 1 [**11-4**]): day 12
   - Pseudomonas not as sensitive to zosyn ([**Date range (1) 5933**])
   - Diptheria Bacteremia: blood culture from [**11-4**] , vancomycin (day 1:
   [**11-4**]) day 13
   - C. diff: PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, negative x2, but very high
   risk.
   - treat for 2 week course for Bacteremia and VAP
   - f/u surveillence cultures
   - ID consult appreciated
   -  wean levophed tolerated- although making little progress, use as
   needed to take off volume with CVVH
   - s/p stress dose steroids ([**Date range (1) 5922**])
   - gave 1 unit PRBCS [**11-14**], increasing pressor requirement and mottled
   feet.
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin
   for mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air
   fluid levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan yesterday. Was making
   stool, but getting less and having a lot of output from Gtube. Possibly
   obstructed, or still has ileus.
   - fluid recuscutation, broad spectrum abx
   - on TPN
   - morphine for pain control
   - daily KUB: no free air so far
   - GI replaced PEG
   COPD/Respiratory: On AC for now. will wean off when mental status
   improves. oxygenating well. Has underlying COPD.
   Currently stable AC 550/20/5/50%
   - Hold on SBT today - failed strongly yesterday
   - albuterol, atrovent inhalers.
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced10/6, back on CVVH.
   - Patient 2L negative from yesterday, will try to take fluid off today
   given significant edema as long as blood pressure tolerates.
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming
   - minimize use of levophed, lowers blood flow to LE
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Dig 0.125mg IV qOD
   - check levels daily
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transused yesterday.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   Upper GI bleed: resolved. Admitted with coffee ground emesis. Pulled
   out foley in peg tract [**11-10**]. No obvious active bleeding.
   - GI consult appreciated: will wait until stable to scope
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and currently admitted for mesenteric ischemia and septic shock. The patient has several medical complications including septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diptheriae in the blood and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum, Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), diphtheria bacteremia, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, mesenteric ischemia, COPD/respiratory issues, atrial fibrillation, anemia, altered mental status, and upper GI bleed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of septic shock, progression of Pseudomonas VAP, development of further complications related to diphtheria bacteremia, recurrence of C. diff infection, potential need for surgical intervention for mesenteric ischemia, exacerbation of COPD/respiratory issues, worsening of atrial fibrillation, further decrease in hemoglobin levels leading to worsening anemia, continued altered mental status, and potential complications from the upper GI bleed.

It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's condition, adjust treatments accordingly, and provide appropriate interventions to manage these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. The patient was admitted with septic shock due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteremia and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum. She is currently on norepinephrine for blood pressure support and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient has several medical complications, including COPD, atrial fibrillation, anemia, hypothyroidism, and a history of upper GI bleed. She is also experiencing mesenteric ischemia, which is being managed conservatively at this time. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and she is responsive to noxious stimuli.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 46/39 mmHg, heart rate of 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27.7 K/u"

   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   Septic Shock: Corynbacterium dipthroid in blood, pseudomonas in sputum.
   Still on levophed. GI source likely given mesenteric ischemia on
   admission. WBC count up.
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]) day 4, continue
   gentamycin (day 1 [**11-4**]): day 14
   - Pseudomonas not as sensitive to zosyn ([**Date range (1) 5933**])
   - Diptheria Bacteremia: blood culture from [**11-4**] , vancomycin (day 1:
   [**11-4**]) day 14, will discontinue today, 14 day course complete.
   - C. diff: PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, negative x2, but very high
   risk.
   - treat for 2 week course for Bacteremia and VAP
   - f/u surveillence cultures
   - ID consult appreciated
   - as wean levophed tolerated, use as needed to take off volume with
   CVVH
   - s/p stress dose steroids ([**Date range (1) 5922**])
   - gave 1 unit PRBCS [**11-14**], increasing pressor requirement and mottled
   feet.
   - Continuing ALL abx for now as pt still in septic shock and not
   improving
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan yesterday. Was making stool, but
   getting less and having a lot of output from Gtube. Possibly
   obstructed, or still has ileus.
   - fluid recuscutation, broad spectrum abx
   - on TPN
   - morphine for pain control
   - daily KUB: no free air so far
   - GI replaced PEG
   COPD/Respiratory: On AC for now. will wean off when mental status
   improves. oxygenating well. Has underlying COPD.
   Currently stable AC 550/20/10/50%
   - Decrease PEEP to 8
   - albuterol, atrovent inhalers.
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH.
   - Patient 1L negative from yesterday, will try to take fluid off today
   given significant edema as long as blood pressure tolerates.
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming
   - minimize use of levophed, lowers blood flow to LE
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Dig 0.125mg IV qOD
   - check levels daily
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transfused yesterday.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   Upper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   - fu repeat TST

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilation dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. She has been admitted to the ICU with the following conditions:

1. Septic shock: Caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae in the blood and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum. The source of sepsis is likely from the GI tract due to mesenteric ischemia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient is currently on meropenem for treatment.
3. Diphtheria bacteremia: The patient has a blood culture positive for Corynebacterium diphtheriae. She is being treated with vancomycin for 14 days.
4. Clostridium difficile (C. diff): The patient is at high risk for C. diff infection, but surveillance cultures have been negative twice. She will continue to be monitored.
5. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient has evidence of bowel ischemia on initial CT scan, but no pneumotosis now. Surgery is following, and the utility of surgery is being re-evaluated daily. The patient is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, septic shock, COPD, atrial fibrillation, anemia, altered mental status, upper GI bleed, hypothyroidism, and other medical conditions. 

The patient is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications. The assessment and plan include treatment for septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae in the blood and pseudomonas in the sputum. Antibiotics have been prescribed for both infections. The patient also has a high risk for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, so treatment with PO vancomycin and IV Flagyl has been initiated. 

The patient's mesenteric ischemia is being managed with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and pain control with morphine.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   Septic Shock: Corynbacterium dipthroid in blood, pseudomonas in sputum.
   Still on levophed. GI source likely given mesenteric ischemia on
   admission. WBC count up.
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]) day 5, continue
   gentamycin (day 1 [**11-4**]): day 15
 will continue until 14 day course of
   meropenem is completed
   - Pseudomonas not as sensitive to zosyn ([**Date range (1) 5933**])
   - Diptheria Bacteremia: blood culture from [**11-4**] , s/p  vancomycin (9/30
 [**11-17**])
   - C. diff: PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, negative x2, but very high
   risk.
   - treat for 2 week course for Bacteremia and VAP
   - f/u surveillence cultures
   - ID consult appreciated
   - as wean levophed tolerated, use as needed to take off volume with
   CVVH
   - s/p stress dose steroids ([**Date range (1) 5922**])
   - gave 1 unit PRBCS [**11-14**], increasing pressor requirement and mottled
   feet
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan yesterday. Was making stool, but
   getting less and having a lot of output from Gtube. Possibly
   obstructed, or still has ileus.
   - fluid recuscutation, broad spectrum abx
   - on TPN
   - morphine for pain control
   - daily KUB: no free air so far
   - GI replaced PEG
 to intermittent suction
   COPD/Respiratory: On AC for now. will wean off when mental status
   improves. oxygenating well. Has underlying COPD.
   Currently stable AC 550/20/5/50%
   - Peep decreased to 5 from 10 yesterday. Will try SBT today.
   - albuterol, atrovent inhalers.
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH.
   - Patient 1L negative from yesterday, will try to take fluid off today
   given significant edema as long as blood pressure tolerates.
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming
   - minimize use of levophed, lowers blood flow to LE
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Dig 0.125mg IV qOD
   - check levels daily
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transfused yesterday.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   Upper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   - fu repeat TST
   Access: Right femoral line and R radial a-line, L tunneled HD line.
   Check placement of iliac stents to see if she may be able to get
   femoral aline for more accurate blood pressure monitoring.
   Code status: no shocks no compressions, only chemical code. confirmed

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She is currently admitted for septic shock caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae in the blood and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum.
- The patient has been receiving various treatments including vancomycin for diphtheria bacteremia, meropenem and gentamicin for Pseudomonas VAP, stress dose steroids, and morphine for pain control.
- She is still dependent on norepinephrine for hemodynamic support and is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 38/31 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 50% FiO2.
- Her mental status is altered, likely due to infection, and she is responsive only to noxious stimuli.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with digoxin.
- She has anemia with a baseline Hct in the low 30s and has received a blood transfusion.

   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   Septic Shock: Corynbacterium dipthroid in blood, pseudomonas in sputum.
   Still on levophed. GI source likely given mesenteric ischemia on
   admission. WBC count up.
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]) day 4, continue
   gentamycin (day 1 [**11-4**]): day 14
   - Pseudomonas not as sensitive to zosyn ([**Date range (1) 5933**])
   - Diptheria Bacteremia: blood culture from [**11-4**] , vancomycin (day 1:
   [**11-4**]) day 14, will discontinue today, 14 day course complete.
   - C. diff: PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, negative x2, but very high
   risk.
   - treat for 2 week course for Bacteremia and VAP
   - f/u surveillence cultures
   - ID consult appreciated
   - as wean levophed tolerated, use as needed to take off volume with
   CVVH
   - s/p stress dose steroids ([**Date range (1) 5922**])
   - gave 1 unit PRBCS [**11-14**], increasing pressor requirement and mottled
   feet.
   - Continuing ALL abx for now as pt still in septic shock and not
   improving
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan yesterday. Was making stool, but
   getting less and having a lot of output from Gtube. Possibly
   obstructed, or still has ileus.
   - fluid recuscutation, broad spectrum abx
   - on TPN
   - morphine for pain control
   - daily KUB: no free air so far
   - GI replaced PEG
   COPD/Respiratory: On AC for now. will wean off when mental status
   improves. oxygenating well. Has underlying COPD.
   Currently stable AC 550/20/10/50%
   - Decrease PEEP to 8
   - albuterol, atrovent inhalers.
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH.
   - Patient 1L negative from yesterday, will try to take fluid off today
   given significant edema as long as blood pressure tolerates.
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming
   - minimize use of levophed, lowers blood flow to LE
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Dig 0.125mg IV qOD

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. She has been diagnosed with Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteremia and pseudomonas aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support, CVVH for renal support, and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has undergone multiple interventions including stress dose steroids, red blood cell transfusion, and placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonas aeruginosa VAP. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and consider weaning off the ventilator if clinically stable.
2. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient has evidence of mesenteric ischemia, which may require surgical intervention. Close monitoring for signs of bowel obstruction or perforation is necessary.
3. Septic shock: The patient remains in septic shock despite receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. Continued hemodynamic support with norepinephrine infusion and CVVH is recommended.
4. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, which could be due to mesenteric ischemia. Close monitoring for"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   Septic Shock: Corynbacterium dipthroid in blood, pseudomonas in sputum.
   Still on levophed. GI source likely given mesenteric ischemia on
   admission. WBC count up.
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]) day 5, continue
   gentamycin (day 1 [**11-4**]): day 15
 will continue until 14 day course of
   meropenem is completed
   - Pseudomonas not as sensitive to zosyn ([**Date range (1) 5933**])
   - Diptheria Bacteremia: blood culture from [**11-4**] , s/p  vancomycin (9/30
 [**11-17**])
   - C. diff: PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, negative x2, but very high
   risk.
   - treat for 2 week course for Bacteremia and VAP
   - f/u surveillence cultures
   - ID consult appreciated
   - as wean levophed tolerated, use as needed to take off volume with
   CVVH
   - s/p stress dose steroids ([**Date range (1) 5922**])
   - gave 1 unit PRBCS [**11-14**], increasing pressor requirement and mottled
   feet
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan yesterday. Was making stool, but
   getting less and having a lot of output from Gtube. Possibly
   obstructed, or still has ileus.
   - fluid recuscutation, broad spectrum abx
   - on TPN
   - morphine for pain control
   - daily KUB: no free air so far
   - GI replaced PEG
 to intermittent suction
   COPD/Respiratory: On AC for now. will wean off when mental status
   improves. oxygenating well. Has underlying COPD.
   Currently stable AC 550/20/5/50%
   - Peep decreased to 5 from 10 yesterday. Will try SBT today.
   - albuterol, atrovent inhalers.
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH.
   - Patient 1L negative from yesterday, will try to take fluid off today
   given significant edema as long as blood pressure tolerates.
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming
   - minimize use of levophed, lowers blood flow to LE
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Dig 0.125mg IV qOD
   - check levels daily
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transfused yesterday.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   Upper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   - fu repeat TST
   Access: Right femoral line and R radial a-line, L tunneled HD line.
   Check placement of iliac stents to see if she may be able to get
   femoral aline for more accurate blood pressure monitoring.
   Code status: no shocks no compressions, only chemical code. confirmed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She was admitted with septic shock caused by Corynebacterium bacteremia and now has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient requires levophed support for mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

The patient has been on meropenem for pseudomonas VAP and gentamicin for Corynebacterium bacteremia. The gentamicin will continue until a 14-day course of meropenem is completed. 

The patient has a high risk of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, so vancomycin and IV Flagyl will be continued despite negative stool tests. 

Weaning attempts of levophed have been unsuccessful. 

Mesenteric ischemia is evident with evidence of pneumotosis bowel on initial CT scan, but there are no signs now. Surgery will follow and re-evaluate the utility of surgery with the family daily. Heparin is contraindicated in her case due to the risk of GI bleeding.

TPN is being held as the port may be clogged, and morphine is given for pain control. 

The patient's COPD/respiratory status did well with a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   Septic Shock: s/p Vanc for Corynbacterium Bacteremia, and now on
   Meropenem Pseudomonas VAP.  Still requiring levophed for MAP > 65/
   - Continue gentamycin (day 1 [**11-4**]): day 15
 will continue until 14 day
   course of meropenem is complete
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**])
   - C. diff: PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, negative x2, but very high
   risk
   - weaning attempts of Levophed have been unsuccessful
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan. Was making stool, but getting
   less and having a lot of output from Gtube without interval change on
   KUB from [**2188-11-19**].
   - fluid recuscutation
   - Continue broad spectrum abx
   - TPN being held as port may be clogged
   - morphine for pain control
   - GI replaced PEG
 to intermittent suction
   COPD/Respiratory:  Did well with SBT yesterday.  Currently on PSV 5/5.
   Will attempt another SBT today.
   - Continue inhalers.
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH.  Patient will require
   replacement of HD catheter, either on [**11-20**] or [**11-21**]
   - Euvolemic from yesterday, maintain euvolemia
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming and worse with hypotension
   - minimize use of levophed, lowers blood flow to LE
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - As per Pharmacy, continue Dig 0.125mg IV qOD
   - check levels daily
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transfused yesterday.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   Upper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   - repeat TST on [**11-17**] WNL
   Access: Right femoral line and R radial a-line, L tunneled HD line.
   Code status: no shocks no compressions, only chemical code. confirmed

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She is currently admitted with septic shock due to Corynebacterium bacteremia and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient requires continuous levophed for mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and ongoing management of her medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has been on meropenem for pseudomonas VAP, but there is a risk of treatment failure or development of antibiotic resistance.
2. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient has evidence of mesenteric ischemia, and surgery is being considered. There is a risk of complications related to surgery, such as bleeding or infection.
3. Heparin Use: The patient has contraindications for heparin use in the setting of mesenteric ischemia due to increased risk of bleeding.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension after initial Levophed wean indicates the need for close monitoring and potential adjustment of vasopressor therapy.
5. TPN Port Clog: The patient's TPN port may be clogged, leading to potential nutrition support issues.
6. GI Bleed: The patient has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   Septic Shock: s/p Vanc for Corynbacterium Bacteremia, and now on
   Meropenem Pseudomonas VAP.  Still requiring levophed for MAP > 65/
   - Continue gentamycin (day 1 [**11-4**]): day 15
 will continue until 14 day
   course of meropenem is complete
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**])
   - C. diff: PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, negative x2, but very high
   risk
   - weaning attempts of Levophed have been unsuccessful
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan. Was making stool, but getting
   less and having a lot of output from Gtube without interval change on
   KUB from [**2188-11-19**].
   - fluid recuscutation
   - Continue broad spectrum abx
   - TPN being held as port may be clogged
   - morphine for pain control
   - GI replaced PEG
 to intermittent suction
   COPD/Respiratory:  Did well with SBT yesterday.  Currently on PSV 5/5.
   Will attempt to put patient on trach mask this am.
   - Continue inhalers.
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH.
   - Euvolemic from yesterday, maintain euvolemia
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming and worse with hypotension
   - minimize use of levophed, lowers blood flow to LE
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - As per Pharmacy, continue Dig 0.125mg IV qOD rather than daily in
   order to avoid digoxin toxicity.
   - check levels daily
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transfused yesterday.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   Upper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   - repeat TST on [**11-17**] WNL
   Access: Right femoral line and R radial a-line, L tunneled HD line.
   Code status: no shocks no compressions, only chemical code. confirmed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. 

The patient is currently in the ICU for septic shock caused by Corynebacterium bacteremia and now has pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She requires levophed for mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient is on meropenem, but there is a risk of ongoing infection and potential resistance to the antibiotic.

2. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient has evidence of pneumotosis bowel on initial CT scan, which indicates compromised blood flow to the intestines. Surgery is being considered, but the risks and benefits need to be evaluated daily.

3. Heparin use: The patient has mottled appearance in the lower extremities, which may be related to poor blood flow. Heparin therapy is being avoided due to the risk of worsening mesenteric ischemia.

4. Anemia: The patient's baseline hemoglobin concentration is low, and she received a blood transfusion yesterday. Further transfusions will be given if her hemoglobin levels drop precipitously or if her blood pressure requirements increase.

5. Mental status changes: The patient is responsive"

   KUB from [**2188-11-19**].
   - continue recuscutation with volume/blood
   - Continue broad spectrum abx,  TPN, morphine for pain control
   COPD/Respiratory:  Did well with SBT yesterday.  Currently on PSV 5/5.
   Will attempt another SBT today.
   - Continue inhalers.
   - follow ABGs, may need vent adjustments
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH, but problem with line
   yesterday.
   - Hyperkalemia today give D50 + insulin 10 units IV and reinstate CVVH
   after return from line check in IR
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming and worse with hypotension
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - As per Pharmacy, reduced digoxin dose
   - check levels tomorrow
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transfused today.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, appearing as distributive shock. She has been treated with vancomycin for Corynebacterium bacteremia and is now on meropenem for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The sources of infection include VAP versus line infection versus abdominal infection.

The patient's medical plan includes adding vancomycin back to the regimen, continuing meropenem for pseudomonas VAP, and giving PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, despite negative tests due to high risk. The patient's blood pressure is still not weaning off from levophed, and vasopressin has been added. The patient also received a blood transfusion.

Regarding mesenteric ischemia, there is evidence of pneumotosis bowel on initial CT scan, but none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating the utility of surgery with the family daily. Heparin has been ruled out as a treatment option for mesenteric ischemia due to potential risks outweighing benefits.

The patient's respiratory condition is improving with COPD/respiratory disease. She did well with a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) 5/5. Another"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a history of pseudomonas infection, hyperkalemia, vascular access issues, and renal failure requiring dialysis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 110/40 mmHg and heart rate of 77 bpm. However, there are concerns about fluid balance, as the patient has received a total of 6,579 mL of fluid intake and lost 3,362 mL of fluid output. The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation. His oxygen saturation is at 100% with FiO2 set at 50%. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, high potassium levels, and abnormalities in other electrolytes. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is on multiple medications including vasopressin, norepinephrine, insulin, and antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an existing pseudomonas infection, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid intake exceeds his output, which can result in fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating a risk of hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion.
4. Electrolyte disturbances"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
                                                                      over
    Septic Shock:
   Appearing distributive shock. She is s/p Vanc for Corynbacterium
   Bacteremia, and on Meropenem for Pseudomonas VAP.
   Sources include VAP vs. line infection vs. abdominal.
   - add PO vancomycin today for empiric Cdiff coverage
   - vanc also to treat possible line infections
   - Cultures pending from a-line and Hd line
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]), Gent for 14 day
   planned course
   - C. diff: PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, negative x2, but very high
   risk
   - weaning attempts of Levophed have been unsuccessful, and we have
   added vasopressin today as levophed maxed. Also bolued 250cc x2 and
   given 2u pRBC.  Will attempt to wean levophed with Vasopressin on
   board.
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan. Was making stool, but getting
   less and having a lot of output from Gtube without interval change on
   KUB from [**2188-11-19**].
   - continue recuscutation with volume/blood
   - Continue broad spectrum abx,  TPN, morphine for pain control
   COPD/Respiratory:  has done well on PSV over the past couple days but
   was put back on CMV yesterday secondary to respiratory acidosis
   - Continue inhalers.
   - follow ABGs, may need vent adjustments
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH, but problem with line
   yesterday.
   -  Getting CVVH this am.
   - Team continue to trouble shoot with the HD line as needed
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming and worse with hypotension
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Continue Digoxin dosing
   - check levels daily
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transfused today.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   Upper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   - repeat TST on [**11-17**] WNL
   Access: Right femoral line [**11-20**] and R radial a-line, L tunneled HD
   line.
   Code status: no shocks no compressions, only chemical code. confirmed

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She was admitted with septic shock, likely due to a combination of sources including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), line infection, and abdominal infection. The patient has been treated with vancomycin for Corynebacterium bacteremia and meropenem for pseudomonas VAP.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Septic Shock: She is still in septic shock despite treatment and appears distributive. She has been given additional medications for coverage and cultures are pending.
2. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient has evidence of mesenteric ischemia, but no pneumotosis bowel on the CT scan. Surgery is being considered, and the utility of surgery will be re-evaluated daily. Heparin is not being used due to the patient's high risk of bleeding.
3. COPD/Respiratory: The patient has done well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but was put back on controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) due to respiratory acidosis. Inhalers are being continued, and adjustments to the ventilator settings may be necessary based on arterial blood gas (ABG) results.
4. ESRD: The patient's CVVH catheter was replaced on [**11-10**"

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including septic shock, respiratory failure, mesenteric ischemia, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypothyroidism. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several complications.

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock may be due to ischemic bowel with bacterial translocation, pneumonia, or cardiogenic shock. Her Levophed requirement has decreased with the addition of Vasopressin. Multiple organisms have been isolated during her admission, but the exact cause of the current decompensation is unclear. It is possible that septic thrombophlebitis with showering emboli occurred after the removal of the dialysis line.

2. Mesenteric Ischemia: There is evidence of mesenteric ischemia on the initial CT scan, which showed pneumotosis bowel. Subsequent scans have shown resolution. The patient's abdomen remains tender on examination.

3. COPD/Respiratory: The patient requires significant mechanical ventilation support.

4. ESRD: Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) has been restarted. Fluid removal may be limited due to borderline blood pressure.

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a complex medical history, including septic shock, respiratory failure, mesenteric ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypothyroidism. 

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, possibly due to ischemic bowel with bacterial translocation, although pneumonia and cardiogenic shock could also be contributing factors. She has been experiencing low blood pressure and requires vasopressor support. The patient's white blood cell count has been increasing, indicating an ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, targeting the most likely organisms based on previous cultures.

Mesenteric ischemia was initially suspected based on imaging findings of pneumatosis intestinalis, but subsequent scans showed resolution. The patient's abdomen remains tender on examination. 

The patient's respiratory status has worsened, requiring significant mechanical ventilation support. Efforts are being made to optimize oxygen delivery while minimizing ventilator-induced lung injury.

Continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) has been restarted after a new dialysis catheter was placed. Fluid removal may be limited due to the patient's borderline blood pressure.

The patient's peripheral circulation is poorly perfused, especially with systemic hypotension. Levophed, a vasopressor, is not optimal for peripheral perfusion but has been used."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of septic shock, respiratory failure, complicated medical history (PMHx), mesenteric ischemia, COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), atrial fibrillation, anemia, hypothyroidism, and febrile neutropenia. The patient underwent several interventions including dialysis line removal, vasopressin administration, blood product transfusion, and tracheostomy tube placement.

The patient's current condition includes difficulty drawing back after left internal jugular (IJ) line change, hyperkalemia (K+ 6), elevated blood glucose levels, and gram-negative rods in sputum. The patient is on multiple medications including vasopressin, insulin, dextrose, pantoprazole, morphine, levothyroxine, protonix, and others.

Vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has a fever of 37.6 degrees Celsius and is receiving mechanical ventilation support.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, D-dimer, and lactic acid levels. The patient has low albumin, potassium, and magnesium levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals general findings such as total body anasarca"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of septic shock, respiratory failure, and other medical conditions.
- She was previously on mechanical ventilation but now requires spontaneous breathing support.
- The patient has been diagnosed with mesenteric ischemia, which has improved clinically and radiographically.
- There are multiple organisms isolated during admission, but no clear culprit for the current decompensation.
- The patient's blood pressure is being supported with IV fluids and vasopressors, including levophed and vasopressin.
- The patient has a history of COPD, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypothyroidism.
- She is currently on various medications and treatments, including TPN (total parenteral nutrition) and digoxin.
- The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient has a history of septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection leading to systemic inflammation and organ failure.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis and acute kidney injury. He has a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's chief complaint is generalized weakness.

On review of systems, the patient reports diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a low-grade fever. His appetite has been poor since admission. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/40 mmHg to 140/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen of 50%, and respiratory system compliance of 36.

Physical examination reveals decreased bowel sounds in all quadrants, dry mucous membranes, and mild pitting edema bilaterally below the knees. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.2 x 10^9/L, elevated creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, decreased hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, elevated potassium of 6.4 mEq/L, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 123 mEq/L. Other labs include elevated lactate of 11.6 K/uL, elevated D-dimer of 3353 ng/mL, and elevated troponin-T of 0.46 ng/mL. Blood cultures from both the left femoral central line and the peripheral line are pending.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, fluconazole, gentamicin, meropenem, metronidazole, and pantoprazole. He is also receiving vasopressin, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate, and insulin via continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing hospital-acquired infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.

3. Cardiac complications: The patient has evidence of myocardial injury with elevated troponin-T levels, suggesting possible cardiac involvement. This puts him at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated D-dimer levels indicate a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of thromboembolic events like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may suggest gastrointestinal involvement, which could potentially lead to bleeding.

6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, with episodes of hypot"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   over
    Septic Shock:
   Appearing distributive shock. She is s/p Vanc for Corynbacterium
   Bacteremia, and on Meropenem for Pseudomonas VAP.
   Sources include VAP vs. line infection vs. abdominal.
   - add PO vancomycin today for empiric Cdiff coverage
   - vanc also to treat possible line infections
   - Cultures pending from a-line and Hd line
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]), Gent for 14 day
   planned course
   - C. diff: PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, negative x2, but very high
   risk
   - weaning attempts of Levophed have been unsuccessful, and we have
   added vasopressin today as levophed maxed. Also bolued 250cc x2 and
   given 2u pRBC.  Will attempt to wean levophed with Vasopressin on
   board.
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan. Was making stool, but getting
   less and having a lot of output from Gtube without interval change on
   KUB from [**2188-11-19**].
   - continue recuscutation with volume/blood
   - Continue broad spectrum abx,  TPN, morphine for pain control
   COPD/Respiratory:  has done well on PSV over the past couple days but
   was put back on CMV yesterday secondary to respiratory acidosis
   - Continue inhalers.
   - follow ABGs, may need vent adjustments
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH, but problem with line
   yesterday.
   -  Getting CVVH this am.
   - Team continue to trouble shoot with the HD line as needed
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming and worse with hypotension
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Continue Digoxin dosing
   - check levels daily
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transfused today.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   Upper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal

   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   over
    Septic Shock:
   Appearing distributive shock. She is s/p Vanc for Corynbacterium
   Bacteremia, and on Meropenem for Pseudomonas VAP.
   Sources include VAP vs. line infection vs. abdominal.
   - add PO vancomycin today for empiric Cdiff coverage
   - vanc also to treat possible line infections
   - Cultures pending from a-line and Hd line
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]), Gent for 14 day
   planned course
   - C. diff: PO vanc and IV Flagyl for C diff, negative x2, but very high
   risk
   - weaning attempts of Levophed have been unsuccessful, and we have
   added vasopressin today as levophed maxed. Also bolued 250cc x2 and
   given 2u pRBC.  Will attempt to wean levophed with Vasopressin on
   board.
   Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis no repeat scan. Was making stool, but getting
   less and having a lot of output from Gtube without interval change on
   KUB from [**2188-11-19**].
   - continue recuscutation with volume/blood
   - Continue broad spectrum abx,  TPN, morphine for pain control
   COPD/Respiratory:  has done well on PSV over the past couple days but
   was put back on CMV yesterday secondary to respiratory acidosis
   - Continue inhalers.
   - follow ABGs, may need vent adjustments
   ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH, but problem with line
   yesterday.
   -  Getting CVVH this am.
   - Team continue to trouble shoot with the HD line as needed
   PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming and worse with hypotension
   Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Continue Digoxin dosing
   - check levels daily
   Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transfused today.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   Upper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   - repeat TST on [**11-17**] WNL
   Access: Right femoral line [**11-20**] and R radial a-line, L tunneled HD
   line.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   # Hypotension: appears to be septic shock from multiple infectious
   sources, including transient bacteremia from gut bacteria in setting of
   mesenteric ischemia, line infectuion, VAP.  She is s/p Vanc for
   Corynbacterium Bacteremia, and on Meropenem/ gentamicin for Pseudomonas
   VAP.  Also on Vanc PO and flagyl for empiric C.Diff.  New episode of
   hypotension [**11-21**] occurred after IR re-sited HD line.
   - C.Diff has been negative, discontinue oral vanc, flagyl.
   -Blood culture has been negative x48hrs, will discontinue vancomycin
   [**11-23**]
   - Cultures pending from a-line and Hd line
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]), Gent for 14 day
   planned course
   - weaning attempts of Levophed have been unsuccessful, and we have
   added vasopressin [**11-21**]  as levophed maxed. Also bolused 250cc x2 and
   given 2u pRBC [**11-21**].  Will attempt to wean levophed with Vasopressin on
   board.
   -check ecg for ischemia, low voltage.
   #Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis on repeat scan. Was making stool, but getting
   less and having a lot of output from Gtube without interval change on
   KUB from [**2188-11-19**].
   - continue recuscutation with volume/blood
   - Continue broad spectrum abx,  TPN, morphine for pain control
   #COPD/Respiratory:  has done well on PSV over the past couple days but
   was put back on CMV yesterday secondary to respiratory acidosis
   - Continue inhalers.
   - follow ABGs, may need vent adjustments
   #ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH, but problem with line
   [**11-19**], IR replaced line [**11-21**].
   -  Getting CVVH this am.
   - Team continue to trouble shoot with the HD line as needed
   #PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming and worse with hypotension
   #Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Continue Digoxin dosing
   - check levels daily
   #Anemia: Hct baseline low 30s, transfused today.
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21
   - will give blood if pressor req goes up.
   #Mental status: Per [**Hospital **] rehab notes, a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per
   son. now responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   #Upper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   #Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   - repeat TST on [**11-17**] WNL
   #Access: Right femoral line [**11-20**], L tunneled HD line.
   Code status: no shocks no compressions, only chemical code. confirmed

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilatory dependence, multiple gastrointestinal bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. 

The patient has several medical complications that require close monitoring and management. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing recurrent episodes of hypotension, which may be due to septic shock from multiple infectious sources, including line infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient has evidence of mesenteric ischemia, likely contributing to her gastrointestinal bleeds. Surgical intervention has been considered, but the risks and benefits need to be evaluated further.

3. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has been diagnosed with Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia and is currently on meropenem and gentamicin for a planned 14-day course.

4. C. difficile infection: Although the patient was previously treated for C. difficile infection, it has been negative, and oral vancomycin and flagyl have been discontinued.

5. Anemia: The patient has a low baseline hematocrit (Hct) level in the 30s, and blood transfusion has been given today. Further management of anemia will depend on the patient's hemodynamic status and response to treatment.

6. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status is"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a complex medical history who has been admitted to the ICU with septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors including mesenteric ischemia, pneumonia, cardiogenic shock, and potential septic thrombophlebitis with emboli showering from the removal of the dialysis line.

The patient's current medical issues include COPD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient is on multiple medications including digoxin, levothyroxine, and various antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. The respiratory support is required, and the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate respiratory acidosis.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate levels, and D-dimer, suggesting an ongoing systemic inflammatory response and possible infection. The patient's renal function tests show impaired kidney function, while liver enzymes and electrolyte levels are within normal ranges.

The patient has experienced significant fluid loss due to presumed mesenteric ischemia and has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and continuous renal replacement"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of septic shock, respiratory failure, complicated medical history, and suspected mesenteric ischemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation support. She has shown improvement in both clinical and radiographic findings. However, she continues to experience episodes of hypotension and requires vasopressor support. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, anemia, hypothyroidism, and end-stage renal disease. She is currently receiving treatment with multiple medications including antibiotics, vasopressin, and dialysis. The patient's family wishes to continue aggressive care, but the prognosis is deteriorating, and the healthcare team is discussing end-of-life issues with the primary care physician.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's history of septic shock indicates a potential complication of systemic infection leading to cardiovascular collapse.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation suggests a potential complication of impaired respiratory function.
3. Mesenteric Ischemia: The evidence of pneumotosis bowel on CT scan indicates a potential complication of reduced blood flow to the intestines, which can lead to bowel necrosis and perforation.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection acquired during mechanical ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the [**Year (4 digits) **]
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with their
   note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and add the
   following points:
   72F with septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of a
   complicated PMHx.  CT strongly suggested mesenteric ischemia but she
   improved both clinically and radiographically.   Septic shock
   presumably due to ischemic bowel w/ bacterial translocation though
   pneumonia and cardiogenic shock could be contributory as well.
   Septic Shock:
   Levophed  requirement decreased with Vasopressin.  Several orgs
   isolated during admission (Corynbacterium dipthroid in blood,
   Pseudomonas mult species in sputum) but no clear culprit of current
   decompensation.  Of note, current decomp began shortly after removal of
   dialysis line - septic thromophlebitis with showering emboli on line
   removal is possibility.   WBC continued trend upward.  Pan cx

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a complicated medical history who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock and respiratory failure. The initial CT scan suggested mesenteric ischemia, but the patient showed clinical improvement and radiographic resolution. She required significant mechanical ventilation support due to COPD. The patient also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She was treated with various medications, including antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), vasopressin, and norepinephrine for hypotension. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, and the family is considering aggressive care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient initially had evidence of mesenteric ischemia on CT scan, which can cause bowel necrosis and lead to septic shock.
2. Septic shock: The patient presented with septic shock, likely due to ischemic bowel, but other causes such as pneumonia and cardiogenic shock could also be contributing factors.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient had isolated organisms in sputum samples, indicating a possible infection.
4. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease, which may require dialysis management.
5. PVD: The patient has peripheral vascular disease, leading to poorly perfused periphery, and worsening perfusion with systemic hypotension.
6. Hypotension"

   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   # Possible Line Infection:
   - IV Vancomycin, f/u cultures, mupirocin
   - Resite line if possible but d/w IR with plan to try and treat through
   line for now as tunnel does not appear infected at this time.
    # Hypotension: appears to be septic shock from multiple infectious
   sources, including transient bacteremia from gut bacteria in setting of
   mesenteric ischemia, line infectuion, VAP.  She is s/p Vanc for
   Corynbacterium Bacteremia, and on Meropenem/ gentamicin for Pseudomonas
   VAP
   - C.Diff has been negative, discontinue oral vanc, flagyl.
    -Blood culture has been negative x48hrs, will discontinue vancomycin
   [**11-23**]
   - weaning attempts of Levophed have been unsuccessful, and we have
   added vasopressin [**11-21**]  as levophed maxed. Also
   # Resistant Pseudomonal VAP
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]), Gent for 14 day
   planned course
   - ID Consult placed for today to determine best approach for P.A. that
   is sensitive only to gent with MIC of 4.
   #Mesenteric Ischemia: No chance in plan
   - continue Resuscitation with volume/blood
   - Continue broad spectrum abx,  TPN, morphine for pain control
   #COPD/Respiratory:  on AC given illness
   - Continue inhalers.
   - follow [**Last Name (LF) 6088**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need vent adjustments
   #ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH, but problem with line
   [**11-19**], IR replaced line [**11-21**].
   -  Getting CVVH this am.
   - Team continue to trouble shoot with the HD line as needed
   #PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming and worse with hypotension
   #Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Continue Digoxin dosing, level wnl without signs of toxicity.
   #Anemia:
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21 or if pressor req goes
   up.
   #Mental status: Per [**Hospital1 723**], a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per son. now
   responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
   #Bpper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   #Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   - repeat TST on [**11-17**] WNL

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and currently admitted for mesenteric ischemia and septic shock. She has several medical complications including possible line infection, hypotension due to septic shock from multiple infectious sources, resistant Pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), mesenteric ischemia, COPD/respiratory issues, ESRD, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), atrial fibrillation, anemia, altered mental status, hypothyroidism, and access issues.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/55 to 116/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheostomy tube with assisted ventilation. The patient is also receiving multiple medications including vasopressin, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, heparin, morphine sulfate, and others.

   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   #Line Infection:
   - IV Vancomycin
   - Resite line if possible
    # Hypotension: appears to be septic shock from multiple infectious
   sources, including transient bacteremia from gut bacteria in setting of
   mesenteric ischemia, line infectuion, VAP.  She is s/p Vanc for
   Corynbacterium Bacteremia, and on Meropenem/ gentamicin for Pseudomonas
   VAP.  Also on Vanc PO and flagyl for empiric C.Diff.  New episode of
   hypotension [**11-21**] occurred after IR re-sited HD line.
    - C.Diff has been negative, discontinue oral vanc, flagyl.
    -Blood culture has been negative x48hrs, will discontinue vancomycin

   added vasopressin [**11-21**]  as levophed maxed. Also
       bolused 250cc x2 and given 2u pRBC [**11-21**].  Will attempt to wean
   levophed with Vasopressin on board.
    -check ecg for ischemia, low voltage.
   #Mesenteric Ischemia: Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT
   scan, none now. Surgery is following, and re-evaluating utility of
   surgery with the family daily. Per [**Doctor First Name **] and GI, risks of heparin for
   mesenteric ischemia outway benefits in her case. CT a/p with air fluid
   levels, no pneumotosis on repeat scan. Was making stool, but getting
   less and having a lot of output from Gtube without interval change on
   KUB from [**2188-11-19**].
   - continue recuscutation with volume/blood

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence, multiple gastrointestinal bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including a line infection, hypotension, Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, anemia, altered mental status, upper gastrointestinal bleed, hypothyroidism, and poor peripheral perfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has a history of line infections, including a recent central venous catheter infection that required replacement.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience episodes of hypotension, which may be due to septic shock from multiple infectious sources, including transient bacteremia from gut bacteria, line infections, and VAP.
3. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient is currently on meropenem and gentamicin for Pseudomonas VAP. The sensitivity report indicates that Tobramycin is sensitive, so a change to Tobramycin may be considered.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has been treated empirically for Clostridium difficile infection with vancomycin and flagyl. However, cultures have been negative, so these medications may be discontinued.
5. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to severe sepsis and multi-organ failure. He has been on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) since admission. The patient's condition remains critical, with persistent left retrocardiac opacity and pulmonary vascular markings consistent with mild fluid overload. He is currently on multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem, and gentamicin, but the recent sputum culture showed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to most antibiotics except for tobramycin and gentamicin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of acquiring additional infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory status, is essential.

2. Antibiotic resistance: The presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to many commonly used antibiotics, poses a significant challenge in treating the patient's infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy must be initiated promptly to prevent further complications.

3. Fluid overload: The patient's imaging shows signs of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory function. Monitoring fluid balance and adjusting fluid intake and output accordingly is crucial.

4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are unstable, indicating ongoing hem"

   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   # Possible Line Infection:
   - IV Vancomycin, f/u cultures, mupirocin
   - Resite line if possible but d/w IR with plan to try and treat through
   line for now as tunnel does not appear infected at this time.
    # Hypotension: appears to be septic shock from multiple infectious
   sources, including transient bacteremia from gut bacteria in setting of
   mesenteric ischemia, line infectuion, VAP.  She is s/p Vanc for
   Corynbacterium Bacteremia, and on Meropenem/ gentamicin for Pseudomonas
   VAP
   - C.Diff has been negative, discontinue oral vanc, flagyl.
    -Blood culture has been negative x48hrs, will discontinue vancomycin
   [**11-23**]
   - weaning attempts of Levophed have been unsuccessful, and we have
   added vasopressin [**11-21**]  as levophed maxed. Also
   # Resistant Pseudomonal VAP
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]), Gent for 14 day
   planned course
   - ID Consult placed for today to determine best approach for P.A. that
   is sensitive only to gent with MIC of 4.
   #Mesenteric Ischemia: No chance in plan
   - continue Resuscitation with volume/blood
   - Continue broad spectrum abx,  TPN, morphine for pain control
   #COPD/Respiratory:  on AC given illness
   - Continue inhalers.
   - follow [**Last Name (LF) 6088**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need vent adjustments
   #ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH, but problem with line
   [**11-19**], IR replaced line [**11-21**].
   -  Getting CVVH this am.
   - Team continue to trouble shoot with the HD line as needed
   #PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming and worse with hypotension
   #Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Continue Digoxin dosing, level wnl without signs of toxicity.
   #Anemia:
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21 or if pressor req goes
   up.
   # Mental status: Per [**Hospital1 723**], a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per son. now
   responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
    #Bpper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   #Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   - repeat TST on [**11-17**] WNL
   #Access: Right femoral line [**11-20**], L tunneled HD line.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia.
- The patient is currently admitted with septic shock due to multiple infectious sources, including line infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and gentamicin, based on the sensitivity of the identified pathogens.
- The patient's condition is complicated by resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa VAP, for which an infectious disease (ID) consult has been obtained to determine the best approach.
- The patient also has anemia, mental status changes likely due to infection, hypothyroidism, and a history of atrial fibrillation.
- The patient's vital signs are unstable, with persistent hypotension requiring vasopressor support.
- The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and altered kidney function tests.
- Imaging studies reveal evidence of mesenteric ischemia and chest X-ray findings suggestive of VAP.
- The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, including a right femoral line and a tunneled hemodialysis catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters, which increases the risk of"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and currently admitted with mesenteric ischemia and septic shock. The patient has several potential medical complications based on the information provided.

1. Possible line infection: The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC) which may be infected. Antibiotics such as vancomycin have been initiated, and cultures are pending. Mupirocin ointment is being applied to the line site.

2. Hypotension: The patient appears to be in septic shock due to multiple infectious sources including transient bacteremia from gut bacteria in the setting of mesenteric ischemia, line infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Vasopressin has been added to the current vasopressor regimen, but the patient remains unable to wean off of Levophed.

3. Resistant Pseudomonal VAP: The patient has developed resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa VAP. Meropenem and gentamicin are being continued for a planned 14-day course. An infectious disease (ID) consult has been placed to determine the best approach for treating Pseudomonas that is sensitive only to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4. Sensitivity testing for other antibiotics such as colistin, amik"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with their
   notes, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and add the
   following points:
   72F with septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of a
   complicated PMHx.  CT strongly suggested mesenteric ischemia but she
   improved both clinically and radiographically.   Septic shock
   presumably due to ischemic bowel w/ bacterial translocation though
   pneumonia and cardiogenic shock could be contributory as well.
   Septic Shock:
   - Continues to require Levophed and vasopressin for bp support
   - Wean vasopressors as tolerated
 has essentially required both
   continuously since line last line replacement septic thromophlebitis
   with showering emboli on line removal is possibility.
   - New strain of PSA isolated in sputum
 resistant to panel except for
   aminogylcosides
   - Cont meropenem & gent.
   - await ID thoughts regarding potential second [**Doctor Last Name **] vs. PSA to prevent
   development of AG resistance
   - WBC trend is stable
   Mesenteric Ischemia:
   - Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT scan, subsequent show
   resolution.
   - Abd remains tender on exam
   - cont bowel rest
   ? Tunnel line infection
   - purulent material from line entry point
   - Standard of care dictates placement of another line at new site
   - pt has h/o significant vascular access issues and therefore limited
   access options
   - Given above, IR assessing feasibility of alternate sites
   - In meantime, topical treatment initiated. Though likelihood of
   clearing infection is not high, it is possible that trying to treat
   through it could become only option if IR unable to secure alternate
   access.  Currently BCx remain negative and evidence c/w tunnel
   infection and not IV line infection.  GS from site show polys but no
   organisms

   - COPD/Respiratory:  cont require significant mech vent support.
   - Cont to rest resp system while hemodyn unstable

   - CVVH
   - Fluid removal as able

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a complicated medical history who is currently in septic shock and respiratory failure. The note mentions several potential medical complications that could arise.

1. Septic Shock: The patient continues to require vasopressor support with levophed and vasopressin. There is a possibility of septic thrombophlebitis with embolic showering on line removal.

2. Mesenteric Ischemia: Although the patient initially showed evidence of mesenteric ischemia with pneumotosis bowel on the CT scan, subsequent scans have shown resolution. However, the patient's abdomen remains tender on examination.

3. Tunnel Line Infection: The patient has purulent material from the line entry point, indicating a potential tunnel line infection. Standard care dictates placement of another line at a new site. However, due to the patient's history of significant vascular access issues, alternate access options are limited. In the meantime, topical treatment has been initiated.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require significant mechanical ventilation support due to COPD/respiratory issues. The respiratory system needs to be rested while the patient is hemodynamically unstable.

5. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) with fluid removal as able.

6. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient's periphery is"

   Assessment and Plan
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with their
   notes, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and add the
   following points:
   72F with septic shock and respiratory failure in the setting of a
   complicated PMHx.  CT strongly suggested mesenteric ischemia but she
   improved both clinically and radiographically.   Septic shock
   presumably due to ischemic bowel w/ bacterial translocation though
   pneumonia and cardiogenic shock could be contributory as well.
   Septic Shock:
   - Continues to require Levophed and vasopressin for bp support
   - Wean vasopressors as tolerated
   - New strain of PSA isolated in sputum
 resistant to panel except for
   aminogylcosides
   - Cont meropenem & gent.
   - d/w ID regarding 2nd [**Doctor Last Name **] for PSA if possible to prevent development
   of AG resistance
   - Current decomp began shortly after removal of dialysis line - septic
   thromophlebitis with showering emboli on line removal is possibility.
   - WBC trend is downward
   Mesenteric Ischemia:
   - Evidence with pneumotosis bowel on initial CT scan, subsequent show
   resolution.
   - Abd remains tender on exam
   - cont bowel rest
   ? Tunnel line infection
   - purulent material from entry point
   - pt has h/o vascular access issues
   - IR assessing for alternate site for line
   - In meantime, trying topical abx treatment
   Resp failure:
   - COPD/Respiratory:  cont require significant mech vent support.
   - Cont to rest resp system while hemodyn unstable
   ESRD:
   - CVVH
   - Fluid removal as able
   PVD:
   - poorly perfused periphery
 sig worsening with systemic hypotension
   - Levophed not optimal for periph perfusion but have been forced to use
   it.
   Atrial Fibrillation:
   - On dig
   Anemia:
   - Hct drifting downward
   - Loss presumed sec mesenteric ischemia
   Hypothyroidism:
   - on levothyoxine
   FEN:
   - TPN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with septic shock and respiratory failure. She has a complicated medical history including ESRD, COPD, PVD, atrial fibrillation, anemia, hypothyroidism, and FEN. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires multiple organ support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Tunnel line infection: The patient has purulent material from the entry point of the dialysis line, and there is a history of vascular access issues. There is a possibility of a tunnel line infection, which may require alternative site placement for the line.

2. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient initially had evidence of pneumotosis bowel on the CT scan, indicating possible mesenteric ischemia. Although the subsequent scans showed resolution, the patient's abdominal tenderness suggests ongoing issues with bowel ischemia. This could lead to further complications such as bowel necrosis or perforation.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient requires significant mechanical ventilation support due to COPD and respiratory failure. If the patient's respiratory status deteriorates, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections.

4. Septic shock: The patient continues to require vasopressor support for blood pressure management. There is a concern for ongoing sepsis due to the presence of a new strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) in the s"

   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   # Possible Line Infection:
   - IV Vancomycin, f/u cultures, mupirocin on line changes
   - Attempt to defer resiting line given limited other options.
    # Hypotension: appears to be septic shock from multiple infectious
   sources, including transient bacteremia from gut bacteria in setting of
   mesenteric ischemia, line infectuion, VAP.  She is s/p Vanc for
   Corynbacterium Bacteremia, and on Meropenem/ gentamicin for Pseudomonas
   VAP
   - Consider echo for change in pump function contributing to hypotension
   - Keep on vancomycin empirically for now to cover entry site infection
   - may need to add neosynephrine
    # Resistant Pseudomonal VAP
   -          No e/o infection on yesterday
s CT scan.
   -          Stop [**Last Name (un) 430**]/gent for now given no e/o ongoing pulm infection
   #Mesenteric Ischemia: No chance in plan
   - continue Resuscitation with volume/blood
   - Continue TPN, start tube feeds given no colonic inflammation on
   recent CT scan
    #COPD/Respiratory:  on AC given illness
   - Continue inhalers.
   - follow [**Last Name (LF) 6088**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need vent adjustments
    #ESRD:
   -  Continuing CVVH through line
    #PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming and worse with hypotension
   #Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Continue Digoxin dosing, level wnl without signs of toxicity.
   #Anemia:
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21 or if pressor req goes
   up.
    # Mental status: Per [**Hospital1 723**], a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per son. now
   responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
     #Bpper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
    #Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   #Access: Right femoral line [**11-20**], L tunneled HD line.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with septic shock from multiple infectious sources, including transient bacteremia from gut bacteria in the setting of mesenteric ischemia, line infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has been treated with various medications, including IV vancomycin for Corynebacterium bacteremia and meropenem/gentamicin for Pseudomonas VAP. The medical team is considering an echocardiogram to assess any change in pump function contributing to hypotension. They have decided to keep the patient on vancomycin empirically to cover the entry site infection and may need to add neosynephrine.

The patient also has resistant Pseudomonal VAP, and the medical team has stopped gentamicin for now due to no evidence of ongoing pulmonary infection. The patient's mesenteric ischemia plan remains unchanged, and they will continue resuscitation with volume/blood. Tube feeds have been started as there is no colonic inflammation on recent CT scan.

The patient's COPD/respiratory condition is being managed with inhalers, and they are following up with a specialist for vent adjustments"

   Pt is a 72 y/o F with a history of ESRD on HD, prolonged vent
   dependence ([**Date range (1) 5713**]), multiple GI bleeds, here with mesenteric
   ischemia and septic shock
   # Possible Line Infection:
   - IV Vancomycin, f/u cultures, mupirocin on line changes
   - Resite line if possible but d/w IR with plan to try and treat through
   line for now as tunnel does not appear infected at this time.
    # Hypotension: appears to be septic shock from multiple infectious
   sources, including transient bacteremia from gut bacteria in setting of
   mesenteric ischemia, line infectuion, VAP.  She is s/p Vanc for
   Corynbacterium Bacteremia, and on Meropenem/ gentamicin for Pseudomonas
   VAP
   - C.Diff has been negative, discontinue oral vanc, flagyl.
    -Blood culture has been negative x48hrs, will discontinue vancomycin
   [**11-23**]
   - weaning attempts of Levophed have been unsuccessful, and we have
   added vasopressin [**11-21**] but unable to titrate off of levophed. Aim for
   MAPS >55-60
    # Resistant Pseudomonal VAP
   - Pseudomonas VAP: Continue Meropenem (day1: [**11-14**]), Gent for 14 day
   planned course
   - ID Consult placed for today to determine best approach for P.A. that
   is sensitive only to gent with MIC of 4.
   - Sensis pending for colistin, amikacin, polymicin
   #Mesenteric Ischemia: No chance in plan
   - continue Resuscitation with volume/blood
   - Continue broad spectrum abx,  TPN, morphine for pain control
    #COPD/Respiratory:  on AC given illness
   - Continue inhalers.
   - follow [**Last Name (LF) 6088**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need vent adjustments
    #ESRD: CVVH catheter replaced [**11-10**], back on CVVH, but problem with
   line [**11-19**], IR replaced line [**11-21**].
   -  Continuing CVVH.
   - Team continue to trouble shoot with the HD line as needed
    #PVD: patient with dopplerable pulses on admission, mottled appearance
   is improving with warming and worse with hypotension
   #Atrial Fibrillation: since [**2188-11-7**] AM, she has had atrial fibrillation
   in the past in the setting of infection and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Continue Digoxin dosing, level wnl without signs of toxicity.
   #Anemia:
   - will transfuse for precipitous drop or hct <21 or if pressor req goes
   up.
    # Mental status: Per [**Hospital1 723**], a&Ox1 baseline, but verbal per son. now
   responsive to noxious stimuli. Likely in setting of infection
     #Bpper GI bleed: likely from mesenteric ischemia, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
    #Hypothyroidism: on 200mcg levothyoxine at home, TSH normal
   - will give 100mcg IV for now
   #Access: Right femoral line [**11-20**], L tunneled HD line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), prolonged ventilator dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, mesenteric ischemia, and septic shock. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Possible Line Infection: The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC) with signs of local inflammation, suggesting a potential line infection. This can be treated with appropriate antibiotics and consideration of removing or replacing the line if necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite vasopressor support, indicating possible septic shock from multiple infectious sources. This requires careful monitoring and management of fluid balance and blood pressure.

3. Resistant Pseudomonal Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP caused by a multidrug-resistant organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Treatment involves using broad-spectrum antibiotics such as meropenem and gentamicin for a planned course. Additionally, an infectious disease consultation has been requested to determine the best approach for treating the resistant pathogen.

4. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient has mesenteric ischemia, which can lead to bowel necrosis and perforation. Continuous monitoring of the patient's vital signs and prompt resusc"

The patient has been diagnosed with various medical conditions including line infection, hypotension, resistant pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), mesenteric ischemia, COPD/respiratory issues, atrial fibrillation, anemia, mental status changes, upper GI bleed, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line Infection: There is a possible line infection, but the lumen of the line does not appear infected given negative blood cultures. The line site was swabbed and polys were seen, but no organism was grown from the site. The decision has been made not to attempt to replace the line due to poor alternate access locations.

2. Hypotension: The patient appears to be in septic shock from multiple infectious sources, including transient bacteremia from gut bacteria in the setting of mesenteric ischemia, line infection, and VAP. She is currently on vancomycin for Corynebacterium bacteremia and on meropenem/gentamicin for Pseudomonas VAP. It may be necessary to add norepinephrine to manage hypotension.

3. Resistant Pseudomonal VAP:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prolonged mechanical ventilation dependence, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds, and mesenteric ischemia. She is currently admitted with septic shock due to multiple infectious sources, including transient bacteremia from gut bacteria in the setting of mesenteric ischemia, line infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has resistant Pseudomonal VAP and is being treated with meropenem and gentamicin. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, anemia, mental status changes, hypothyroidism, and a history of GI bleed. She is receiving various medications and interventions, including vasopressin, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, heparin, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line Infection: The patient's right femoral line and other lines should be monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, redness, swelling, or purulent drainage. Cultures should be obtained if there is suspicion of line infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic shock from multiple infectious sources. It is important to closely monitor her blood pressure and administer appropriate fluids and vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has resistant Pseudom"

The patient is a 69-year-old male with an unknown chief complaint. The patient is currently on comfort measures only (CMO) status. The patient's allergies include caffeine, butalbital, barbiturates, xanthines, and an unknown allergy. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2188-11-25**] at 09:17 AM (Vancomycin), 09:00 PM (Gentamicin), and 04:00 AM (Meropenem).

The patient is receiving several infusions, including calcium gluconate (CRRT) at 1.4 grams/hour and morphine sulfate at 2 mg/hour. In the ICU, the patient is also receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and morphine sulfate. Other medications include TPN with lipids at 59 mL/hour.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 36.7 to 36.2 Celsius, heart rate between 72 and 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 56/25 to 137/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight has increased from 62.4 kg at admission to 79.4 kg currently. The total fluid intake is 8,325 mL, with 1,547 mL being IV fluids. The total fluid output is 7,952 mL, with 1,643 mL being urine output.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. The ventilator settings include a set tidal volume of 550 mL, set respiratory rate of 26, peak inspiratory pressure of 32 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O, and compliance of 32.4 cmH2O/mL. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.05, PaCO2 of 91, PaO2 of 62, and HCO3- of 26 mEq/L.

Physical examination findings include absent peripheral pulses, unassessed skin, and unassessed neurologic status.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 25.4%, platelet count (Plt) of 116, creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 111 to 179 mg/dL, and elevated D-dimer levels of 3353 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition via TPN with lipids, glycemic control, lines management, dialysis catheter placement, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is comfort measures only, and the disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation, indwelling lines, and immunosuppression. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased WBC count, and changes in vital signs is crucial.

2. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid, resulting in a weight gain from 62.4 kg to 79.4 kg. Close monitoring of fluid balance and urine output is necessary to prevent fluid overload and subsequent pulmonary edema.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to septic shock or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and prompt intervention with fluids or vasopressors are necessary.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 62 and low respiratory rate. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is required to ensure adequate gas exchange. Tracheostomy tube displacement or blockage should be considered, and appropriate measures should be taken to optimize ventilation.

5. Renal dysfunction: Elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction. Monitoring kidney function through repeated laboratory tests and adjusting fluid and medication management accordingly is important.

6. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for DVT and pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures such as heparin sodium infusion and early mobil"
