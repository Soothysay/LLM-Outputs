   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ h/o congenital deafness, HTN, DM, CAD, osteoarthritis and L
   subclavian steal syndrome admitted s/p ERCP for cholangitis c/b ARF and
   respiratory failure.  Stable and transferred to floor
 now readmitted
   intubated s/p hypoxic respiratory arrest in the setting of aspiration.
   Also with worsening leukocytosis and severe gastric dilatation
   concerning for obstruction.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Aspirated on [**2123-1-2**] in setting of
   ileus and gastric distention.  Bronch showed bilious purulence in major
   airways.  CXR evolution with bilateral effusions consistent with ARDS.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be aggravated by volume overload from IVF to manage sepsis.  Meets
   ARDS criteria.
   - ARDSnet protocol
   - F/U sputum culture
   - Broad antibiotic coverage for aspiration PNA
   (meropenem/gent/vanco/flagyl/fluconazole)
   - Consider vancomycin PR for empiric treatment of c. diff despite neg
   c. diff studies
   # Shock:  Likely secondary to bacterial sepsis and aggravated by
   third-spacing secondary to pancreatitis.
   - continue to balance CVP and hypotension goals with pulmonary edema
   and hypoxia given high ventilator requirement
   - attempt to wean levophed, vasopressin
   - check CVO2
   - antibiotics as above
   - Cycle enzymes and EKGs to r/o cardiac event (or demand ischemia)
   # Pancreatitis:  Pt noted to have cholangitis and pancreatitis on ERCP
   examination; two stones were extracted from the ampulla and common
   hepatic duct and a sphincterotomy was performed [**12-19**].  Now has areas of
   necrosis, ileus, and gastric dilatation with bilious vomiting.  Surgery
   following and state there is no indication for surgery at this time.
   - continue supportive care
   - OGT to suction
   - F/U surgery recs
   #Leukocytosis: Initially thought due to c. diff colitis, and although
   c. diff negative, had started resolving with PO vanc.  Now rising again
   (with bandemia) in setting of aspiration and hypotension.  Unclear
   source, although PNA or abdominal sources are likely.
   - Pan culture
   - restart flagyl and consider PR vanco
   - ID following
   # DIC:  Mild coagulopathy; will check DIC labs q12h.
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD:  Renal following, appreciate reccs.  Will restart CVVH
   for hyperkalemia (K 6.3 w/o EKG changes).
   - renally dose meds
   - continue CVVH for now
   # ?Pulmonary embolism:  Unclear if patient actually has PE.
   - will hold heparin for now given low suspicion for PE at this point

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was admitted for cholangitis and respiratory failure, but now readmitted intubated due to hypoxic respiratory arrest caused by aspiration. The patient also has worsening leukocytosis and severe gastric dilatation concerning for obstruction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient experienced hypoxic respiratory arrest in the setting of aspiration, leading to bilateral effusions consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient meets ARDS criteria and is being managed with ARDSnet protocol, broad antibiotic coverage, and consideration for vancomycin per rectum for empirical treatment of Clostridium difficile despite negative studies.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock secondary to bacterial sepsis and aggravated by third-spacing secondary to pancreatitis. The goal is to balance central venous pressure (CVP) and hypotension goals with pulmonary edema and hypoxia given high ventilator requirement. Levophed and vasopressin weaning attempts will be made, along with checking CVO2, antibiotics as above, and monitoring for cardiac events or ischemia.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has cholangitis and pancreatitis on ERCP examination, with two stones extracted from the ampulla and common hepatic duct"

   respiratory failure.  Stable and transferred to floor
 now readmitted
   intubated s/p hypoxic respiratory arrest in the setting of aspiration.
   Also with worsening leukocytosis and severe gastric dilatation
   concerning for obstruction.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  This is in the setting of worsening
   tachypnea over the last few days.  This is likely due to intermittent
   aspiration with a large-volume aspiration event this am.  Bronch showed
   bilious pus in major airways.  Meets ARDS criteria.
   - ARDSnet protocol
   - F/U sputum culture
   - Broad antibiotic coverage for aspiration PNA (meropenem/vanco/flagyl)
 per ID
   - After multiple failed a.line attempts
 will need femoral a. line
   later today
   #Hypotension: Likely due to sepsis, althought hemorrhagic conversion of
   his pancreatitis cannot be excluded.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. The patient was initially admitted for cholangitis and acute respiratory failure, and was stable enough to be transferred to the floor. However, the patient experienced a hypoxic respiratory arrest due to aspiration and was readmitted to the ICU. The patient also has worsening leukocytosis and severe gastric dilatation, which is concerning for obstruction.

24-hour events include the start of invasive ventilation, multi-lumen insertion, dialysis catheter insertion, bronchoscopy, and arterial line insertion.

The patient has multiple medical issues, including hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, gastric dilatation with bilious vomiting, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, leukocytosis, pancreatitis/cholangitis, and potential pulmonary embolism.

Assessment and plan include addressing the hypoxic respiratory failure with ARDSnet protocol, broad antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia, and consideration of femoral arterial line placement. The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis or hemorrhagic conversion of pancreatitis. Gastric dilatation with bilious vomiting raises concerns for bowel obstruction possibly due to phlegmon or pseudocyst formation, requiring consultation with surgery. Chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis needs coordination of IV contrast and planning for continuous veno"

   intubated s/p hypoxic respiratory arrest in the setting of aspiration
   [**12-21**] bowel obstruction from head of pancreas.  Has severe septic shock
   and ARDS.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS:  This is in the setting of
   worsening tachypnea over the last few days.  This is likely due to
   intermittent aspiration with a large-volume aspiration event this am.
   Bronch showed bilious pus in major airways.  Meets ARDS criteria.
   - ARDSnet protocol
   - F/U bronchial washings
   - Broad antibiotic coverage for aspiration PNA

   - Follow CVP, cVO2 sat and titrate IVF
   - Cycle enzymes and EKGs to r/o cardiac event (or demand ischemia)
   # Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: Pt noted to have cholangitis and
   pancreatitis on ERCP examination, two stones were extracted from the
   ampulla and common hepatic duct, a sphincterotomy was performed [**12-19**].
   Now with bowel obstruction [**12-21**] pancreatic head: Not a surgical
   candidate at this time.
   - Follow-up final CT read
   - F/U surgery recs
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Persistent renal failure on HD (got this am) [**12-21**] to ATN,
   now s/p contrast load for CT.
   - CVVHD to start this am
   - F/U renal recs
   #Leukocytosis: Initially thought due to c. diff colitis, and although
   c. diff negative, had started resolving with PO vanc.  Now rising again
   in setting of aspiration and hypotension.  6%bands.  Unclear source,
   although PNA or abdominal sources are likely.
   - Pan culture

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient has worsening tachypnea and a recent large-volume aspiration event, along with bilious pus in major airways seen during bronchoscopic examination. These findings suggest intermittent aspiration leading to ARDS. The patient meets ARDS criteria and requires ARDSnet protocol management.

2. Septic shock: The patient has severe septic shock, likely due to aspiration pneumonia (PNA), pancreatitis, and bowel microperforation. Broad antibiotic coverage is necessary, and the pressors (norepinephrine and vasopressin) should be weaned as tolerated.

3. Pancreatitis/cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis and pancreatitis, as indicated by the ERCP examination and extraction of stones from the ampulla and common hepatic duct. However, there is now a bowel obstruction caused by the pancreatic head, making the patient a non-surgical candidate at this time.

4. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient has persistent renal failure, initially attributed to ATN but now worsened by contrast load for CT. CVVHD should be started, and renal recommendations should be followed up.

5. Leukocytosis: Initially thought to be due to c. diff colitis, leukocytosis is now rising again in the setting of aspiration and hypotension. Pan culture, ID"

   [**12-21**] bowel obstruction from head of pancreas.  Has severe septic shock
   and ARDS.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS:  This is in the setting of
   worsening tachypnea over the last few days.  This is likely due to
   intermittent aspiration with a large-volume aspiration event this am.
   Bronch showed bilious pus in major airways.  Meets ARDS criteria.
   - ARDSnet protocol; will place esophageal balloon to guide PEEP
   - F/U bronchial washings
   - Broad antibiotic coverage for aspiration PNA

   potential sources.  On 2 pressors.
   - F/U cx
   - Continue vanc/gent/[**Last Name (un) 614**]/fluc and follow-up with ID consult team
   - Consider changing to caspo if clear evidence of bowel perforation
   - Wean norepi then vasopressin as tolerated
   - Follow CVP, cVO2 sat and titrate IVF
   - Cycle enzymes and EKGs to r/o cardiac event (or demand ischemia)
   # Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: Pt noted to have cholangitis and
   pancreatitis on ERCP examination, two stones were extracted from the
   ampulla and common hepatic duct, a sphincterotomy was performed [**12-19**].
   Now with bowel obstruction [**12-21**] pancreatic head: Not a surgical
   candidate at this time.

   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Persistent renal failure on HD (got this am) [**12-21**] to ATN,
   now s/p contrast load for CT.
   - CVVHD to start this am
   - F/U renal recs
   #Leukocytosis: Initially thought due to c. diff colitis, and although
   c. diff negative, had started resolving with PO vanc.  Now rising again

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. The patient was initially admitted for cholangitis and acute respiratory failure, but is now readmitted due to hypoxic respiratory arrest in the setting of aspiration and bowel obstruction caused by the head of the pancreas. The patient has severe septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's worsening tachypnea and intermittent aspiration events suggest ongoing hypoxia and potential deterioration in lung function. Close monitoring and adherence to ARDSnet protocol, including placement of an esophageal balloon to guide PEEP, are recommended.

2. Septic shock: The patient is on two pressors and has multiple potential sources of infection including aspiration pneumonia, pancreatitis, and bowel microperforation. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage should be continued, and consideration should be given to changing antibiotics if evidence of bowel perforation is present. Pressor medications should be weaned as tolerated, and cardiac events should be ruled out.

3. Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: The patient had cholangitis and pancreatitis on ERCP examination, and two stones were extracted from the ampulla and common hepatic duct. However, the patient now has bowel obstruction caused by the pancreatic head and is not a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was initially admitted for cholangitis and respiratory failure after an ERCP procedure. He was later readmitted due to hypoxic respiratory arrest caused by aspiration and bowel obstruction from the head of the pancreas. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has severe septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's worsening tachypnea over the last few days is likely due to intermittent aspiration with a large-volume aspiration event this morning. Bronchoscopy showed bilious pus in major airways, meeting the criteria for ARDS. The plan includes following the ARDSnet protocol, obtaining follow-up bronchial washings, and initiating broad antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia.

2. Septic shock: The patient has septic shock caused by aspiration pneumonia, pancreatitis, and bowel microperfusion. He is currently on two pressors (norepinephrine and vasopressin) to maintain blood pressure. The plan includes following up with culture results, continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, and consulting with the ID team.

3. Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: The patient has pancreatitis and cholangitis based on the ERCP examination. Two stones were extracted from the"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ h/o congenital deafness, HTN, DM, CAD, osteoarthritis and L
   subclavian steal syndrome admitted s/p ERCP for cholangitis c/b ARF and
   respiratory failure.  Stable and transferred to floor
 now readmitted
   intubated s/p hypoxic respiratory arrest in the setting of aspiration
   [**12-21**] bowel obstruction from head of pancreas.  Has severe septic shock
   and ARDS.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS:  This is in the setting of
   worsening tachypnea over the last few days.  This is likely due to
   intermittent aspiration with a large-volume aspiration event this am.
   Bronch showed bilious pus in major airways.  Meets ARDS criteria.
   - ARDSnet protocol
   - F/U bronchial washings
   - Broad antibiotic coverage for aspiration PNA
 vanc/zosyn/gent/fluc
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated
   #Septic shock: Aspiration PNA, pancreatitis, bowel microperf are
   potential sources.  On 2 pressors.
   - F/U cx
   - Continue vanc/gent/zosyn/fluc and follow-up with ID consult team
   - Wean norepi then vasopressin as tolerated
   - Follow CVP, cVO2 sat and titrate IVF
   - Cycle enzymes and EKGs to r/o cardiac event (or demand ischemia)
   # Pancreatitis/Cholangitis: Pt noted to have cholangitis and
   pancreatitis on ERCP examination, two stones were extracted from the
   ampulla and common hepatic duct, a sphincterotomy was performed [**12-19**].
   Now with bowel obstruction [**12-21**] pancreatic head: Not a surgical
   candidate at this time.
   - Follow-up final CT read
   - F/U surgery recs
   # [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: Persistent renal failure on HD (got this am) [**12-21**] to ATN,
   now s/p contrast load for CT.
   - CVVHD to start this am
   - F/U renal recs
   #Leukocytosis: Initially thought due to c. diff colitis, and although
   c. diff negative, had started resolving with PO vanc.  Now rising again
   in setting of aspiration and hypotension.  6%bands.  Unclear source,
   although PNA or abdominal sources are likely.
   - Pan culture
   - ID following
   - Abx as above
   - Continue c.diff PO vanc/ IV flagyl
   #Coagulopathy: Likely consistent with early DIC
   - F/U DIC labs q12 hours
   # ?Pulmonary embolism:  Unclear if patient actually has PE
 unable to
   get CTA at this time due to lack of PIV access.
   - Hold heparin in the interim given possibility of needing surgery and
   concerns for hemorrhagic conversion of pancreatitis.
   All other systems as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of congenital deafness, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, osteoarthritis, and left subclavian steal syndrome. He was initially admitted for cholangitis and respiratory failure after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Now readmitted, he is intubated following a hypoxic respiratory arrest caused by aspiration and bowel obstruction from the head of the pancreas. The patient also has severe septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure/ARDS: The patient's worsening tachypnea and intermittent aspiration events suggest ongoing respiratory distress. This condition may progress to further hypoxia and respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely due to aspiration pneumonia, pancreatitis, and bowel microperfusion. Continued monitoring for signs of sepsis and appropriate antibiotic coverage are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Pancreatitis/cholangitis: The patient's pancreatitis and cholangitis require ongoing management. The presence of stones in the ampulla and common hepatic duct indicates a potential ongoing source of inflammation. Regular follow-up and evaluation are needed to monitor the progress and address any complications.

4. Bowel obstruction: The patient's bowel obstruction caused by the pancreatic head may require surgical intervention. Close"
