   ICU for altered mental status.
   1)Neuro- DDx - seizures, tox/metabolic- infection, etoh or benzo
   withdrawal.
   Pancultured, on abx for bacterial infection and acyclovir for possible
   HSV encephalitis given RBC in CSF, and now being treated with Keppra.
   CIWA scale. EEG monitoring starting now.
   Subdural hematoma- will try to keep INR<2.0.
   2)ID- low grade fevers, workup and treatment as above. Staph in urine
   covered. consider tapping effusion if no improvement but likely low
   yield.
   3)Pulm- try to extubate today if mental status improved.
   4)FEN- beriberi, continue repletion. Continue Lasix for generalized
   edema. on TFs
   5)Heme- coagulopathy, likely nutritional/hepatic dysfunction.

   Disposition :
   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of alcoholism and beriberi weakness. He was initially admitted and treated for beriberi weakness but was readmitted to the ICU for altered mental status. 

The patient's condition has continued to deteriorate, with worsening mental status, intermittent seizures, fever, and respiratory acidosis. He was intubated upon arrival to the ICU. A head CT revealed a 4mm subdural hematoma, which was not present on a previous CT scan from 3/21. The patient received fresh frozen plasma for coagulopathy. 

His vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/71 mmHg to 141/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's lab results show anemia, coagulopathy, elevated white blood cell count, increased lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging studies reveal a subdural hematoma and non-specific periventricular white matter changes on an MRI. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, antiepileptics, and others. He is also receiving nutritional support and has been given thiamine supplementation due to beriberi.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with 25 years of heavy alcohol abuse, presents with several
   months of progressive distal to proximal weakness, now thought to be
   due to wet beri beri, sent to the ICU with worsening MS, fevers, and
   concern for seizure.
   .
   ## AMS: This is worsened in past 2 days. Etiology broad and could
   include infectious, bleed/stroke, metabolic, withdrawal (less likely
   given in hospital for 7 days, though had 65mg diazepam on 13th and 14th
   as well as 10mg diazepam on 15th, 2mg ativan on 15th, and 1mg ativan on
   the 16th, none since). Pt has involuntary shaking and documented eye
   deviation to the left.   These are better today after keppra started.
   LP done [**3-24**] showing no signs of infection at this point, but multiple
   RBCs.  While the tap was traumatic, this is concerning for HSV in
   addition to subarachnoid hemorrhage.  CT on [**3-25**] shows 4mm subdural new
   from [**3-21**].  He also has a UCx from [**3-23**] growing staph, already on
   vanc.  Aspiration pna was also a concern despite CT chest showing no
   consolidation (does show bilateral pleural effusions).  He was started
   on vanc/zosyn/cipro.  Less likely but possible is hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - acyclovir empirically for HSV encephalitis
   - cont infectious workup - f/u cultures, consider tapping pleural
   effusions.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics

   - lactulose 30 TID
   .
   # Fever/tachycardia: Together these symptoms are concerning for PE
   especially with episode of hypoxia, however CTA was negative for PE.
   Other concerns include SIRS from infection.  LP NTD from [**3-24**], though
   blood concerning for HSV.  Only cultured source thus far is
   staphylococcus in urine, though other potential sources could be HCV
   encephalitis, pleural effusions.  Withdrawal could also contribute to
   tachycardia, though he is 1 week out from admission (though had 65mg
   diazepam on 13th and 14th as well as 10mg diazepam on 15th, 2mg ativan
   on 15th, and 1mg ativan on the 16th, none since).  Unlikely NMS given
   only had .5 of haldol and 10mg of olanzapine during entire stay.
   - cont antibiotics as above
   - f/u cultures
   - consider tapping pleural effusions
   - CIWA
   - consider CT abd for GI source if no improvement

   ## Respiratory acidosis: likely [**3-7**] sedation from keppra given nl pH
   earlier today.  s/p intubation.
   - wean as tolerated.

   ## subdural hemorrhage: small, 4mm with no midline shift, though could
   contribute to focus for seizure.  Also with coagulopathy, concern is
   for ongoing bleeding.  This is new since the 16th given not evident on
   MRI from [**3-21**].  vit k 10mg IV and FFP given with improvement in INR.
   - repeat CT if changes in mental status, o/w, f/u for resolution in [**4-6**]
   weeks.
   .
   ## pleural effusions: likely compressive atelectasis vs parapneumonic
   effusions, most likely compressive atelectasis with effusions represent
   total body edema.  Still could be infected and source of fevers.
   - consider thoracentesis
   .
   ## Beriberi: Weakness intially improved with thiamine repletion. He has
   components of both wet and dry Beriberi - heart failure, edema and
   weakness.
   - Continue Thiamine, B complex, Multivitamin, folate

   ## Volume status: Peripheral edema, likely due to capillary leak
   syndrome secondary to Beriberi. Also many liters positive over
   admission for tachycardia.  Known pleural effusions.
   - lasix

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse presenting with several months of progressive weakness, now thought to be due to wet beri beri. He was sent to the ICU with worsening mental status, fevers, and concern for seizure. 

The patient has a subdural hemorrhage of 4mm, which is new since the 16th and not evident on an MRI from the 21st. There is concern for ongoing bleeding, especially with the coagulopathy. The patient received vit K 10mg IV and FFP with improvement in INR.

The patient also has pleural effusions, which are likely compressive atelectasis versus parapneumonic effusions. These effusions represent total body edema. There is a concern for infection, and a thoracentesis may be considered.

Additionally, the patient has signs of beriberi, with components of both wet and dry beriberi - heart failure, edema, and weakness. The patient's weakness initially improved with thiamine repletion, so it is recommended to continue thiamine, B complex, multivitamin, and folate.

The patient has volume status issues with peripheral edema and positive liters over admission for tachycardia. Known pleural effusions are also present. Lasix may be considered to address the volume status.

There are concerns about GI bleed with maroon stools during his stay, but hematocrit is stable. Gu"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU with progressive weakness, fevers, and concern for seizure. He has been diagnosed with wet beriberi, and his condition has been improving after receiving thiamine repletion. Other medical complications include respiratory acidosis, subdural hemorrhage, anemia, pleural effusions, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver dysfunction, elevated lipase levels, electrolyte imbalances, and code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient is at risk for seizures due to the diagnosis of AMS (altered mental status) and the administration of anticonvulsant medication (Kendra).
2. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a potential ongoing infection. Further workup and cultures are needed to identify the causative organism.
3. Subdural Hemorrhage: The patient has a small subdural hemorrhage that could contribute to seizure activity. There is a concern for ongoing bleeding due to coagulopathy, and the patient requires close monitoring.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and is at risk for bleeding. Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma have been administered to improve coagulation parameters.
5. Pleural Effusions: The patient has pleural effusions likely due to compressive atelectasis or par"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with 25 years of heavy alcohol abuse, presents with several
   months of progressive distal to proximal weakness, now thought to be
   due to wet beri beri, sent to the ICU with worsening MS, fevers, and
   concern for seizure.
   .
   ## AMS: This is worsened in past 2 days. Etiology broad and could
   include infectious, bleed/stroke, metabolic, withdrawal (less likely
   given in hospital for 7 days, though had 65mg diazepam on 13th and 14th
   as well as 10mg diazepam on 15th, 2mg ativan on 15th, and 1mg ativan on
   the 16th, none since). Pt has involuntary shaking and documented eye
   deviation to the left.   These are better today after keppra started.
   LP done [**3-24**] showing no signs of infection at this point, but multiple
   RBCs.  While the tap was traumatic, this is concerning for HSV in
   addition to subarachnoid hemorrhage.  CT on [**3-25**] shows 4mm subdural new
   from [**3-21**].  He also has a UCx from [**3-23**] growing staph, already on
   vanc.  Aspiration pna was also a concern despite CT chest showing no
   consolidation (does show bilateral pleural effusions).  He was started
   on vanc/zosyn/cipro.  Less likely but possible is hepatic
   encephalopathy.
   - acyclovir empirically for HSV encephalitis
   - cont infectious workup - f/u cultures, consider tapping pleural
   effusions.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - continuous EEG per neuro
   - s/p keppra load, continuing [**Hospital1 7**] keppra dosing
   - conservative CIWA
   - check CK given possible persistent seizures, ? rhabdo (Cr stable)
   - lactulose 30 TID
   .
   # Fever/tachycardia: Together these symptoms are concerning for PE
   especially with episode of hypoxia, however CTA was negative for PE.
   Other concerns include SIRS from infection.  LP NTD from [**3-24**], though
   blood concerning for HSV.  Only cultured source thus far is
   staphylococcus in urine, though other potential sources could be HCV
   encephalitis, pleural effusions.  Withdrawal could also contribute to
   tachycardia, though he is 1 week out from admission (though had 65mg
   diazepam on 13th and 14th as well as 10mg diazepam on 15th, 2mg ativan
   on 15th, and 1mg ativan on the 16th, none since).  Unlikely NMS given
   only had .5 of haldol and 10mg of olanzapine during entire stay.
   - cont antibiotics as above
   - f/u cultures
   - consider tapping pleural effusions
   - CIWA
   - consider CT abd for GI source if no improvement
   .
   ## Respiratory acidosis: likely [**3-7**] sedation from keppra given nl pH
   earlier today.  s/p intubation.
   - wean as tolerated.
   .
   ## subdural hemorrhage: small, 4mm with no midline shift, though could
   contribute to focus for seizure.  Also with coagulopathy, concern is
   for ongoing bleeding.  This is new since the 16th given not evident on
   MRI from [**3-21**].  vit k 10mg IV and FFP given with improvement in INR.
   - repeat CT if changes in mental status, o/w, f/u for resolution in [**4-6**]
   weeks.
   .
   ## pleural effusions: likely compressive atelectasis vs parapneumonic
   effusions, most likely compressive atelectasis with effusions represent
   total body edema.  Still could be infected and source of fevers.
   - consider thoracentesis
   .
   ## Beriberi: Weakness intially improved with thiamine repletion. He has
   components of both wet and dry Beriberi - heart failure, edema and
   weakness.
   - Continue Thiamine, B complex, Multivitamin, folate
   .
   ## Volume status: Peripheral edema, likely due to capillary leak
   syndrome secondary to Beriberi. Also many liters positive over
   admission for tachycardia.  Known pleural effusions.
   - lasix
   - goal negative
   .
   ## GI bleed: Marroon stools during his stay, hematocrit stable.
   - Guaiac, and monitor Hct.
   .
   ## Coagulopathy:? hepatic contribution, possible component of DIC
   (fibrinogen not low on [**3-21**])  Improvement after FFP and vit k
   - Monitor HCT and transfuse prn Hct <21 (has now gotten 5U RBCs and 2U
   FFP, none since [**2191-3-20**])
   - fibrinogen not suspicious for DIC, ddimer elevated nonspecific
   .
   ## LFT abnormalities: Leading diagnosis is alcoholic hepatitis.  Never
   given steroids.  Stable, not improving.
   - Liver recs (appreciate input)
   - HBV, HIV, HSV, EBV, CMV neg
   - abd u/s to assess for ascites
   - Lactulose as above
   .
   ## Elevated lipase: Trending down after peak 808. Likely etoh related
   subclinical pancreatitis.
   - follow
   - consider CT abd to eval for inflammation/pseudocyst
   .

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse who presented with several months of progressive distal to proximal weakness, thought to be due to wet beriberi. He was admitted to the ICU with worsening myasthenia syndrome, fevers, and concern for seizure.

AMS (acute mental status change) has worsened over the past two days, and the etiology is broad, including infectious, bleed/stroke, metabolic, withdrawal (less likely given in-hospital stay for 7 days). The patient has involuntary shaking and documented eye deviation to the left. These symptoms improved after starting Kendra (levetiracetam).

A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed on 03/24 showing no signs of infection at this point but multiple red blood cells. While the tap was traumatic, this is concerning for HSV (herpes simplex virus) in addition to subarachnoid hemorrhage. A CT scan on 03/25 showed a 4mm subdural hematoma new from 03/21. He also has urinary catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UCx) from 03/23 growing Staphylococcus, already on vancomycin.

   withdrawal. Seems to have significant improvement now, making seizure
   more likely.
   Pancultured, on abx for bacterial infection and acyclovir for possible
   HSV encephalitis given RBC in CSF, and now being treated with Keppra.
   Subdural hematoma- will d/c EEG for MRI today per neuro. will try to
   keep INR<2.0.
    2)ID- low grade fevers, workup and treatment as above. Staph in urine
   covered. consider tapping effusions if no improvement but likely low

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with 25 years of heavy alcohol abuse, presents with several
   months of progressive distal to proximal weakness, now thought to be
   due to wet beri beri, sent to the ICU with worsening MS, fevers, and
   concern for seizure.
   .
   ## AMS: now improved after keppra dosing,  making seizure more likely.
   Still could be contribution from infection, subdural noted.
   - acyclovir empirically for HSV encephalitis
 d/w with neuro re: d/c
   acyclovir
   - cont infectious workup - f/u cultures, consider tapping pleural
   effusions.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - continuous EEG per neuro
 discuss stopping continuous EEG
   - s/p keppra load, continuing [**Hospital1 7**] keppra dosing
   - conservative CIWA
 not requiring
   - d/c lactulose
   .
   # Fever/tachycardia: fever low grade, trended down.  CTA negative for
   PE.
   - cont antibiotics as above
   - f/u cultures
   - consider tapping pleural effusions
   - consider CT abd for GI source if no improvement
   .
   ## Respiratory acidosis: improved after intubations, no successfully
   weaned.
   - extubate
   .
   ## subdural hemorrhage: small, 4mm with no midline shift, though could
   contribute to focus for seizure.  Also with coagulopathy, concern is
   for ongoing bleeding.  This is new since the 16th given not evident on
   MRI from [**3-21**].  vit k 10mg IV and FFP given with improvement in INR.
   - MRI per neuro
 difficulty given continuous EEG.  Leads are
   compatible, but staff unable to disconnect from box.  Either d/c
   continuous EEG as above or need EEG nurse to help with disconnecting
   box from leads
   - f/u MRI
   .
   ## Anemia: up and down since admission. Likely at least partially from
   nutritional issues including b12 deficiency (MCV 101) though also had
   maroon guaiac pos stools during this admission.  No grossly bloody
   stools at this point.
   - guaiac stools
   - recheck in PM
   - further workup if still down this afternoon
   - cont b vitamin supplementation
   ## pleural effusions: likely compressive atelectasis vs parapneumonic
   effusions, most likely compressive atelectasis with effusions represent
   total body edema.  Still could be infected and source of fevers.  Has
   not seemed to directly effect respiratory status
   - consider thoracentesis if no further improvement
   .
   ## Beriberi: Weakness intially improved with thiamine repletion. He has
   components of both wet and dry Beriberi - heart failure, edema and
   weakness.
   - Continue Thiamine, B complex, Multivitamin, folate
   .
   ## Volume status: Peripheral edema, likely due to capillary leak
   syndrome secondary to Beriberi. Also many liters positive over
   admission for tachycardia.  Known pleural effusions.
   - lasix
   - goal negative
   .
   ## GI bleed: Marroon stools during his stay.
   - Guaiac, and monitor Hct.
   .
   ## Coagulopathy:? hepatic contribution, possible component of DIC
   (fibrinogen not low on [**3-21**])  Improvement after FFP and vit k
   - Monitor HCT and transfuse prn Hct <21 (has now gotten 5U RBCs and 2U
   FFP, none since [**2191-3-20**])
   - fibrinogen not suspicious for DIC, ddimer elevated nonspecific
   - guaiac stools
   .
   ## LFT abnormalities: Leading diagnosis is alcoholic hepatitis.  Never
   given steroids.  Stable, not improving.  Slight increased echogenicity
   on RUQ, + ascites, mild splenomegaly.  Has GB sludge.
   - Liver recs (appreciate input)
   - HBV, HIV, HSV, EBV, CMV neg
   - Lactulose discontinued as above
   .
   ## Elevated lipase: Trending down after peak 808. Likely etoh related
   subclinical pancreatitis.
   - follow
   - consider CT abd to eval for inflammation/pseudocyst
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes: Tube feeds, replete lytes prn
   .
   ## Prophylaxis: sc heparin, ppi
   .

","The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse presenting with progressive weakness, now thought to be due to wet beriberi. He was sent to the ICU with worsening MS, fevers, and concern for seizure. The patient's condition has improved after receiving Keptra dosing, but there is still a possibility of seizure due to infection or subdural hematoma.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Respiratory acidosis: The patient was successfully extubated but remains on supplemental oxygen. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.

2. Subdural hemorrhage: The patient has a small subdural hemorrhage with no midline shift, which could contribute to seizure activity. There is concern for ongoing bleeding due to coagulopathy. Close monitoring and repeat imaging may be required.

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to nutritional issues, including vitamin B12 deficiency (MCV 101) and gastrointestinal bleeding. Further workup and supplementation are needed.

4. Pleural effusions: The patient has pleural effusions that are likely compressive atelectasis rather than parapneumonic effusions. These effusions represent total body edema and could be a source of fevers. Thoracentesis may be considered if there is no further improvement.

5. Beriberi: The patient exhibits components of both wet and dry beriberi - heart failure, ed"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 yo male with 25 years of heavy alcohol abuse, presents with several
   months of progressive distal to proximal weakness, now thought to be
   due to wet beri beri, sent to the ICU with worsening MS, fevers, and
   concern for seizure.
   .
   ## AMS: now improved after keppra dosing, making seizure more likely.
   Still could be contribution from infection, subdural noted.
   - acyclovir d/c
d given HSV PCR negative in CSF
   - cont infectious workup - f/u cultures, consider tapping pleural
   effusions.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - continue [**Hospital1 7**] keppra dosing
   - conservative CIWA
 not requiring
   - cont Lactulose/rifaximin per liver
   .
   # Fever/tachycardia: fever low grade, trended down.  CTA negative for
   PE.  Other causes for fever that are noninfectious could include
   atelectasis, pleural effusions, and dvt.
   - cont antibiotics as above
   - f/u cultures
   - consider tapping pleural effusions
   - consider CT abd for GI source if no improvement
   - reimage RUQ given sludge
   .
   ## Differential UE edema: possible DVT
   - LUE u/s
   .
   ## Respiratory acidosis: improved after intubations, no successfully
   weaned and extubated.
   .
   ## subdural hemorrhage: small, 4mm by CT with no midline shift, though
   could contribute to focus for seizure.  s/p vit k 10mg IV and FFP given
   with improvement in INR. Repeat MRI shows no hemorrhage but increase in
   an extra axial nonhemorrhage fluid collection which per radiology could
   indicate meningitis.  She has negative LP for bacterial meningitis on
   [**3-24**] with improvement since.
   - MRI per neuro
 difficulty given continuous EEG.  Leads are
   compatible, but staff unable to disconnect from box.  Either d/c
   continuous EEG as above or need EEG nurse to help with disconnecting
   box from leads
   - f/u MRI
   .
   ## Anemia: up and down since admission. Likely at least partially from
   nutritional issues including b12 deficiency (MCV 101) though also had
   maroon guaiac pos stools during this admission.  No grossly bloody
   stools at this point.
   - guaiac stools
   - recheck in PM
   - further workup if still down this afternoon
   - cont b vitamin supplementation
   ## pleural effusions: likely compressive atelectasis vs parapneumonic
   effusions, most likely compressive atelectasis with effusions represent
   total body edema.  Still could be infected and source of fevers.  Has
   not seemed to directly effect respiratory status
   - consider thoracentesis if no further improvement
   .
   ## Beriberi: Weakness intially improved with thiamine repletion. He has
   components of both wet and dry Beriberi - heart failure, edema and
   weakness.
   - Continue Thiamine, B complex, Multivitamin, folate.  Change thiamine
   to PO.
   .
   ## Volume status: Peripheral edema, likely due to capillary leak
   syndrome secondary to Beriberi. Also many liters positive over
   admission for tachycardia.  Known pleural effusions.
   - lasix
   - goal negative
   .
   ## GI bleed: Marroon stools during his stay.  Guaiac negative in ICU.
   - Guaiac, and monitor Hct.
   .
   ## Coagulopathy:? hepatic contribution, possible component of DIC
   (fibrinogen not low on [**3-21**])  Improvement after FFP and vit k
   - Monitor HCT and transfuse prn Hct <21 (has now gotten 5U RBCs and 2U
   FFP, none since [**2191-3-20**])
   - fibrinogen not suspicious for DIC, ddimer elevated nonspecific
   - guaiac stools
   .
   ## LFT abnormalities: Leading diagnosis is alcoholic hepatitis.  Never
   given steroids.  Stable, not improving.  Slight increased echogenicity
   on RUQ, + ascites, mild splenomegaly.  Has GB sludge.
   - Liver recs (appreciate input)
   - HBV, HIV, HSV, EBV, CMV neg
   - Lactulose and rifaximin
   .
   ## Elevated lipase: Trending down after peak 808. Likely etoh related
   subclinical pancreatitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 39-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU with worsening muscle strength (MS), fevers, and concern for seizure. The patient's condition has been improving, but there are several ongoing medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Autonomic Dysfunction (AMS): The patient experienced confusion and hallucinations after extubation, which may indicate autonomic dysfunction. This has improved with the use of Kendra (levetiracetam) dosing.

2. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers, and there is concern for an ongoing infection. A broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen is being continued, and further infectious workup is needed, including cultures and consideration of tapping pleural effusions.

3. Subdural Hemorrhage: A small subdural hemorrhage was identified on CT scan, but it is not causing any midline shift. The patient received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and a repeat MRI showed no hemorrhage but an increase in an extra-axial nonhemorrhagic fluid collection, which could indicate meningitis. Further imaging and evaluation are required.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been fluctuating throughout his admission. Nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin B12 deficiency, may contribute to the anemia. Further evaluation and supplementation are recommended.

5. Pleural Effusions: The patient has pleural effusions,"
