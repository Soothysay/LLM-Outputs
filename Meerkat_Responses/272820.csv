   Assessment and Plan
   Shock, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pulmonary infiltrates
   (L>>R)
   HYPOTENSION -- concerns include hypovolemia (blood loss), and possibly
   advanced sepsis.  No evidence for cardiogenic shock, or neurologic
   shock.  Doubt pulmonary embolism, but at risk for thromboembolic
   disease (IVC filter.  Plan support BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Wean
   vasopressors.
   OLIGURIA -- hypovolemic likely; Plan resussitation, monitor UO, BUN,
   creatinine.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- suspect aspiration Left lung.
   HEMATURIA -- suspect related to placement & attempts for nephrostomy
   tubes.  Underlying bladder source.  Concern for retroperitoneal
   bleed/dissection.  Monitor serial Hct.  Transfuse plts if <50k.
   PROSTATE CA -- advanced.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia in part.  Continue iv fluids to CVP>8.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 55 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and remains intubated. The presence of pulmonary infiltrates suggests possible aspiration pneumonia.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to hypovolemia (blood loss) or advanced sepsis. There is no evidence of cardiogenic shock or neurogenic shock.

3. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, as indicated by rising serum lactic acid levels and other abnormal lab results.

4. Prostate Cancer: The patient has a history of advanced prostate cancer.

5. Oliguria: The patient is producing low urine output, which could be due to hypovolemia or kidney dysfunction.

6. Hematuria: There is evidence of blood in the urine, possibly related to the placement and attempts for nephrostomy tubes. Underlying bladder source is suspected, and there is concern for retroperitoneal bleed/dissection.

7. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has hypovolemia and requires continued IV fluids to maintain CVP (central venous pressure) above 8.

It is important to note that these are potential complications based on the information provided in the progress note, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary for the patient's well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   Shock, respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pulmonary infiltrates
   (L>>R).  Continue to maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  F/U
   CXR.
   HYPOTENSION -- concerns include hypovolemia (blood loss), and possibly
   advanced sepsis.  No evidence for cardiogenic shock, or neurologic
   shock.  Doubt pulmonary embolism, but at risk for thromboembolic
   disease (IVC filter.  Plan support BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.  Wean
   vasopressors as tolerated.
   OLIGURIA -- hypovolemic +/- septic shock likely; Plan resussitation,
   monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- suspect aspiration Left lung.
   HEMATURIA -- suspect related to placement & attempts for nephrostomy
   tubes.  Underlying bladder source.  Concern for retroperitoneal
   bleed/dissection.  Monitor serial Hct.  Transfuse plts if <50k.
   PROSTATE CA -- advanced.  No further treatment planned.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia in part.  Continue iv fluids to CVP>8.
   SEPSIS
 Evidence for polymicrobial sepsis (+ blood culture);  continue
   support, vasopresors, montoring, empirical antimicrobials.  Possible
   sources include lungs, urinary tract.
   HEMATURIA
 attributed in part to bladder erosion, but also to recent
   instrumentation.
   ECCHYMOSIS
 concern for retroperitoneal bleeding (recent
   instrumentation).  Plan torso CT to assess for bleed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several ongoing medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and has pulmonary infiltrates, suggesting respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, including aspiration.

2. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive despite receiving vasopressors, which indicates a concern for hypovolemia (blood loss) and possibly advanced sepsis. There is no evidence for cardiogenic shock or neurogenic shock.

3. Oliguria: The patient is experiencing reduced urine output, which may be due to hypovolemic shock or septic shock. It is important to monitor urine output, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels.

4. Pulmonary infiltrates: The patient has pulmonary infiltrates, primarily in the left lung, which are suggestive of aspiration. This can contribute to ongoing respiratory distress.

5. Hematuria: The patient has hematuria, which is likely related to the placement and attempts for nephrostomy tubes. There is also concern for a possible retroperitoneal bleed/dissection. Serial hemoglobin monitoring and platelet transfusion if necessary should be considered.

6. Prostate cancer: The patient has advanced prostate cancer, but no further treatment is planned.

7. Fluid management: The patient has hypovolemia and requires continued intravenous fluids to maintain a central venous pressure (C"

   Assessment and Plan:
   Assessment and Plan: 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to
   bone and liver, h/o DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI
   from radiation cystits, being transferred to the MICU for close
   monitoring given his hemodynamic instability s/p IR placement of a R
   nephrostomy tube.  Unclear etiology of his hemodynamic compromise at
   this time.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities.  Overnight, most likely etiology thought to be hypovolemic
   shock in the setting of significant post-procedure bleed.  However, Hct
   responded well to PRBC transfusions. Other possible etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock (unlikely given no acute changes on EKG, negative
   initial CK and troponin, normal mixed venous O2 saturation), sepsis,
   adrenal insufficiency, pulmonary embolus (still at risk even with IVC
   filter).  Elevated lactate suggests tissue hypoxia
 though may be
   somewhat iatrogenic in the setting of vasopressors.
   - S/p 3 L of fluid in the OR and 4 L of fluid in the ICU, still with
   poor urine output
   - Wean pressors to goal MAP of >60, wean phenylephrine first
   - Trend CVP, Lactates, Mixed Venous O2 Sat, urine output
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25-30%
   - Complete r/o with cardiac enzymes
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test
   - Vancomycin and Zosyn for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage,
   follow-up cultures
   - Guiac stools (concern for mesenteric ischemia, though no significant
   pain on exam)
   - Consider abdominal imaging (CT) if stable, if not stable, renal
   ultrasound to eval for possible hematoma
   #Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology at this point. CXR with possible
   L sided PNA.  Currently stable on PSV. Received large amounts of fluid,
   at risk for pulmonary edema.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   ##Radiation cystitis: Pt has gross hematuria from radiation cystitis.
   Per urology, urine is clearer s/p formalin instillation to bladder on
   [**2170-10-19**]. Hct has been stable.
   - trend Hct  q6hrs
   - Nephrostomy tube in place, catheter care as per IR, follow output. IR
   to look at tube today.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Appreciate Urology input
   - continue Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms
   .
   ## Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden). Given
   minimal utility of trending LFTs, will stop monitoring daily LFTs at
   this point. Asterixis noted on exam previously.
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  when off sedation
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.
   - Hct bumped appropriately s/p 4 units PRBCs
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <25 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding
   .
   ## Chronic Pain:Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer, currently
   on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   -resume Methadone 10 mg PO BID
   -continue Morpine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   -continue oxybutynin, belladona, gabapentin
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of dilaudid,
   oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI given his
   ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes: Cardiac diet, replete lytes prn
   .
   ## Access: Had triple lumen RIGHT IJ placed [**2170-10-15**]; RIGHT PICC placed
   by [**2170-10-31**]
   .
   ## Code status: DNR (discussed with family)
   .
   ## Communication: [**Doctor First Name 16**]-Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5836**]. [**Doctor First Name 16**] was called given his
   significant hypotension overnight, and the family arrived around
   4:30am.  Multiple discussions with the family re: directions of care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, who presented to the ICU with shock and respiratory failure after undergoing nephrostomy tube placement. He has been experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, and poor urine output. The cause of his hemodynamic instability is unclear, but possible etiologies include hypovolemic shock due to a significant post-procedure bleed, cardiogenic shock, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or pulmonary embolism. He has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has been on various vasopressors, including levo, neo, and vasopressin. His lactate levels are elevated, indicating tissue hypoxia.

The patient's respiratory failure may be due to an unclear etiology, with a possible left-sided pneumonia seen on a chest X-ray. He is currently stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV). Due to the large amounts of fluid administered, there is a concern for pulmonary edema. His laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, likely secondary to hepatic involvement of prostate cancer. He also has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which could be related to his underlying malignancy, bony involvement, and acute blood loss during the IR procedure.

Other issues include radiation cystitis, for which he has received formalin instillation to the bladder, and transaminitis, which is expected to be related to his hepatic"

   Assessment and Plan:
   Assessment and Plan: 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to
   bone and liver, h/o DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI
   from radiation cystits, being transferred to the MICU for close
   monitoring given his hemodynamic instability s/p IR placement of a R
   nephrostomy tube.  Unclear etiology of his hemodynamic compromise at
   this time.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities.  Overnight, most likely etiology thought to be hypovolemic
   shock in the setting of significant post-procedure bleed.  However, Hct
   responded well to PRBC transfusions. Other possible etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock (unlikely given no acute changes on EKG, negative
   initial CK and troponin, normal mixed venous O2 saturation), sepsis,
   adrenal insufficiency, pulmonary embolus (still at risk even with IVC
   filter).  Elevated lactate suggests tissue hypoxia
 though may be
   somewhat iatrogenic in the setting of vasopressors.
   - S/p 3 L of fluid in the OR and 4 L of fluid in the ICU, still with
   poor urine output
   - Wean pressors to goal MAP of >60, wean phenylephrine first
   - Trend CVP, Lactates, Mixed Venous O2 Sat, urine output
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25-30%
   - Complete r/o with cardiac enzymes
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test
   - Vancomycin and Zosyn for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage,
   follow-up cultures
   - Guiac stools (concern for mesenteric ischemia, though no significant
   pain on exam)
   - Consider abdominal imaging (CT) if stable, if not stable, renal
   ultrasound to eval for possible hematoma
   #Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology at this point. CXR with possible
   L sided PNA.  Currently stable on PSV. Received large amounts of fluid,
   at risk for pulmonary edema.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   ##Radiation cystitis: Pt has gross hematuria from radiation cystitis.
   Per urology, urine is clearer s/p formalin instillation to bladder on
   [**2170-10-19**]. Hct has been stable.
   - trend Hct  q6hrs
   - Nephrostomy tube in place, catheter care as per IR, follow output. IR
   to look at tube today.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Appreciate Urology input
   - continue Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms
   .
   ## Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden). Given
   minimal utility of trending LFTs, will stop monitoring daily LFTs at
   this point. Asterixis noted on exam previously.
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  when off sedation
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.
   - Hct bumped appropriately s/p 4 units PRBCs
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <25 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding
   .
   ## Chronic Pain:Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer, currently
   on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   -resume Methadone 10 mg PO BID
   -continue Morpine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   -continue oxybutynin, belladona, gabapentin
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of dilaudid,
   oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI given his
   ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes: Cardiac diet, replete lytes prn
   .
   ## Access: Had triple lumen RIGHT IJ placed [**2170-10-15**]; RIGHT PICC placed
   by [**2170-10-31**]
   .
   ## Code status: DNR (discussed with family)
   .
   ## Communication: [**Doctor First Name 16**]-Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5836**]. [**Doctor First Name 16**] was called given his
   significant hypotension overnight, and the family arrived around
   4:30am.  Multiple discussions with the family re: directions of care.
   .
   ## Dispo: Pending clinical improvement  or decisions about direction of
   care

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, who presented to the ICU with shock and respiratory failure following the placement of a right nephrostomy tube. He is hypotensive, tachycardic, and has cool extremities. His hemodynamic status has been unstable, and he has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and approximately 4 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) boluses. He is currently on vasopressors, including levo, neo, and vasopressin, and his heart rate has improved from the 140s to the 100s overnight. The patient also has a history of radiation cystitis, which is causing gross hematuria, and he is being managed with formalin instillation to the bladder.

Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient is experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, suggesting possible hypovolemic shock due to significant post-procedure bleeding. Other potential causes include cardiogenic shock, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and pulmonary embolism. The elevated lactate level indicates tissue hypoxia, which may be iatrogenic due to vasopressors. The patient has received aggressive fluid resuscitation, but his poor urine output persists.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unclear, with a possible left-sided pneumonia on chest X-ray"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to
   bone and liver, h/o DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI
   from radiation cystits, being transferred to the MICU for close
   monitoring given his hemodynamic instability s/p IR placement of a R
   nephrostomy tube.  Unclear etiology of his hemodynamic compromise at
   this time.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities.  Overnight, most likely etiology thought to be hypovolemic
   shock in the setting of significant post-procedure bleed.  However, Hct
   responded well to PRBC transfusions. Other possible etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock (unlikely given no acute changes on EKG, negative
   initial CK and troponin, normal mixed venous O2 saturation), sepsis,
   adrenal insufficiency, pulmonary embolus (still at risk even with IVC
   filter).  Elevated lactate suggests tissue hypoxia
 though may be
   somewhat iatrogenic in the setting of vasopressors.
   - Still with poor urine output, trying to refrain from further fluid
   resuscitation due to anasarca.
   - Wean pressors to goal MAP of >60, wean phenylephrine first
   - Trend CVP, Lactates, Mixed Venous O2 Sat, urine output
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25-30%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test
   - Vancomycin and Zosyn, for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, and
   adding Aztreonam for double coverage of gm negative rods.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Consider abdominal imaging (CT) if stable, if not stable, renal
   ultrasound to eval for possible hematoma
   #Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology at this point. CXR with possible
   L sided PNA.  Currently stable on PSV. Received large amounts of fluid,
   at risk for pulmonary edema.
   - Follow ABGs
   - CXR in the morning.
   - SBT tomorrow for possible extubation.
   - Wean vent as tolerated / sedated.
   ##Radiation cystitis: Pt has gross hematuria from radiation cystitis.
   Per urology, urine is clearer s/p formalin instillation to bladder on
   [**2170-10-19**]. Hct has been stable.
   - Trend Hct  q6hrs
   - Nephrostomy tube in place, catheter care as per IR, follow output. IR
   to look at tube today.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Appreciate Urology input
   - Continue Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms
   .
   ## Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden). Given
   minimal utility of trending LFTs, will stop monitoring daily LFTs at
   this point. Asterixis noted on exam previously.
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  when off sedation
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <25 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding
   .
   ## Chronic Pain:Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer, currently
   on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   -resume Methadone 10 mg PO BID
   -continue Morpine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   -continue oxybutynin, belladona, gabapentin
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of dilaudid,
   oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
   his ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes: Cardiac diet, replete lytes prn
   .
   ## Access: Had triple lumen RIGHT IJ placed [**2170-10-15**]; RIGHT PICC placed
   by [**2170-10-31**]
   .
   ## Code status: DNR (discussed with family)
   .
   ## Communication: [**Doctor First Name 16**]-Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5836**]. [**Doctor First Name 16**] was called given his
   significant hypotension overnight, and the family arrived around
   4:30am.  Multiple discussions with the family re: directions of care.
   .
   ## Dispo: Pending clinical improvement  or decisions about direction of
   care

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver, who is experiencing hemodynamic instability after an interventional radiology (IR) procedure involving a right nephrostomy tube placement. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 103.0°F (38.9°C), blood pressure of 96/51 mmHg, heart rate of 105 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is sedated and intubated.

The patient has a history of radiation cystitis, for which he received formalin instillation to the bladder. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), but is no longer anticoagulated due to recurrent hematuria.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, suggesting tissue hypoxia, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated transaminase levels, which may be secondary to hepatic involvement of prostate cancer. The patient's platelet count is low, and his hemoglobin concentration is also low.

The patient has several medical complications, including hemodynamic instability, respiratory failure, radiation cystitis, transaminitis, anemia/thrombocytopenia, chronic pain, prostate cancer, history of DVT/PE, pressure ulcer, obstructive"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver. He has a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, radiation cystitis, and is currently being treated in the MICU for hemodynamic instability following the placement of a right nephrostomy tube. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 96/51 mmHg, heart rate of 105 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient is tachycardic and hypotensive with cool extremities. The possible etiologies include hypovolemic shock due to significant post-procedure bleed, cardiogenic shock (unlikely given no acute changes on EKG, negative initial CK and troponin, normal mixed venous O2 saturation), sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or pulmonary embolus. The patient has received 3 liters of fluid in the OR and 4 liters of fluid in the ICU, but still has poor urine output. Pressors have been weaned to goal MAP of >60, with phenylephrine being weaned first. The patient's lactates, mixed venous O2 saturation, and urine output are being trended. The Hct has been kept"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications include:

1. Fever: The patient has been experiencing a high fever, reaching up to 103.0°F (39.4°C). This could indicate an infection or sepsis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device. The vital signs show a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and an ABG indicating respiratory acidosis. These findings suggest respiratory failure, likely due to acute lung injury or another underlying cause.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, with readings ranging from 96/51 mmHg to 118/71 mmHg. This may be indicative of septic shock or another form of distributive shock.

4. Sepsis: The presence of fever, hypotension, and abnormal laboratory values such as elevated white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate levels suggest a systemic infection leading to sepsis. The blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, confirming the presence of a bacterial infection.

5. Cancer: The patient has a history of malignant neoplasm, specifically prostate cancer. This information is relevant as it may contribute to the overall clinical picture and influence treatment decisions.

6. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's laboratory"

   Imaging:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Status post right nephrostomy placement. The distal end of right
   nephrostomy tube coils in the distal right ureter.
   2. New right renal subcapsular hematoma and small right perinephritic
   hematoma measuring 12 x 23 mm.
   3. Both kidneys are diffusely heterogeneous with foci of relative
   hyperintensity related to contrast administration, a finding that
   suggests
   ATN and which is more prominent on the right. Wedge shaped
   hypoperfusion in
   right kidney could reflect ischemia or infarct of that section prior to
   previous contrast administration, or alternatively could represent
   improved
   function of that portion of kidney with appropriate clearance of
   previously
   administered contrast.
   4. New hemorrhage or infiltrative mass in the left lateral bladder
   wall.
   5. Interval increase in size and number of osseous metastases.
   6. Unchanged fatty liver.
   Moderate bilateral pleural effusion and
   bibasilar atelectasis with a focal area of consolidation within the
   left upper
   lobe are new.
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to
   bone and liver, h/o DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI
   from radiation cystits, being transferred to the MICU for close
   monitoring given his hemodynamic instability s/p IR placement of a R
   nephrostomy tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities.  With fever and persistently positive bacteremia most
   likely sepsis. Initially most likely etiology thought to be hypovolemic
   shock in the setting of significant post-procedure bleed.  However, Hct
   responded well to PRBC transfusions. Other possible etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock (unlikely given no acute changes on EKG, negative
   initial CK and troponin, normal mixed venous O2 saturation), sepsis,
   adrenal insufficiency, pulmonary embolus (still at risk even with IVC
   filter).  Elevated lactate suggests tissue hypoxia
 though may be
   somewhat iatrogenic in the setting of vasopressors. Imaging shows new
   hemorrhage in bladder wall and LUL PNA and hematoma.
   - Still with poor urine output, trying to refrain from further fluid
   resuscitation due to anasarca.
   - Wean pressors to goal MAP of >60, wean phenylephrine first
   - Trend CVP, Lactates, Mixed Venous O2 Sat, urine output
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25-30%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test
   - Vancomycin and Zosyn, for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, and
   adding Aztreonam for double coverage of gm negative rods. Consider
   change Abx to Dapto to cover VRE given persistently positive GPC,
   Enterococcus on blood cx while on Vanco
   - Follow-up cultures and [**Last Name (un) **]
   #Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology at this point. CXR and CTc/w LUL
   PNA.  Currently stable on PSV. Received large amounts of fluid, at risk
   for pulmonary edema.
   - Follow ABGs
   - CXR in the morning.
   - SBT tomorrow for possible extubation.
   - Wean vent as tolerated / sedated.
   ##Radiation cystitis: Pt has gross hematuria from radiation cystitis.
   Per urology, urine is clearer s/p formalin instillation to bladder on
   [**2170-10-19**]. Hct has been stable.
   - Trend Hct  q8hrs
   - Nephrostomy tube in place, catheter care as per IR, follow output. IR
   to look at tube today.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Appreciate Urology input
   - Continue Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms
   .
   ## Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden). Given
   minimal utility of trending LFTs, will stop monitoring daily LFTs at
   this point. Asterixis noted on exam previously.
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  when off sedation
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <25 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding
   .
   ## Chronic Pain:Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer, currently
   on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   -resume Methadone 10 mg PO BID
   -continue Morpine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   -continue oxybutynin, belladona, gabapentin
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen of dilaudid,
   oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan.
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
   his ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes: Cardiac diet, replete lytes prn
   .
   ## Access: Had triple lumen RIGHT IJ placed [**2170-10-15**]; RIGHT PICC placed
   by [**2170-10-31**]

   ATN and which is more prominent on the right. Wedge shaped
   hypoperfusion in

   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities.  With fever and persistently positive bacteremia most
   likely etiology  is sepsis. Initially was thought to be hypovolemic
   shock in the setting of significant post-procedure bleed.  However, Hct
   responded well to PRBC transfusions and has been stable. Elevated
   lactate suggests tissue hypoxia although has trended down. Imaging
   shows new hemorrhage in bladder wall and LUL PNA and hematoma.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with widely metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver, history of DVT/PE, on continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) for radiation cystitis, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and failure to extubate after interventional radiology (IR) placement of a right nephrostomy tube. The patient remains intubated and is on minimal ventilator settings. He is febrile, tachycardic, hypotensive, and has cool extremities. He has persistently positive bacteremia most likely due to sepsis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been stable after red blood cell transfusions but still has poor urine output. He has elevated lactate levels indicating tissue hypoxia. Imaging shows new hemorrhage in the bladder wall and left upper lobe pneumonia (PNA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistently positive bacteremia and fever suggest ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis. Immediate management should include broad-spectrum antibiotics and source control measures.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's poor urine output and elevated lactate levels suggest inadequate renal perfusion. AKI can be caused by hypotension, sepsis, or direct renal damage from the nephrostomy tube placement.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on minimal ventilator settings,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to
   bone and liver, h/o DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI
   from radiation cystits, being transferred to the MICU for close
   monitoring given his hemodynamic instability s/p IR placement of a R
   nephrostomy tube.  Unclear etiology of his hemodynamic compromise at
   this time.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities.  Overnight, most likely etiology thought to be hypovolemic
   shock in the setting of significant post-procedure bleed.  However, Hct
   responded well to PRBC transfusions. Other possible etiologies include
   cardiogenic shock (unlikely given no acute changes on EKG, negative
   initial CK and troponin, normal mixed venous O2 saturation), sepsis,
   adrenal insufficiency, pulmonary embolus (still at risk even with IVC
   filter).  Elevated lactate suggests tissue hypoxia
 though may be
   somewhat iatrogenic in the setting of vasopressors.
   - Still with poor urine output, trying to refrain from further fluid
   resuscitation due to anasarca.
   - Wean pressors to goal MAP of >60, wean phenylephrine first
   - Trend CVP, Lactates, Mixed Venous O2 Sat, urine output
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25-30%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test
   - Vancomycin and Zosyn, for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, and
   adding Aztreonam for double coverage of gm negative rods.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Consider abdominal imaging (CT) if stable, if not stable, renal
   ultrasound to eval for possible hematoma
   #Respiratory failure: Unclear etiology at this point. CXR with possible
   L sided PNA.  Currently stable on PSV. Received large amounts of fluid,
   at risk for pulmonary edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver, who has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring due to hemodynamic instability following the placement of a right nephrostomy tube. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypovolemic shock, possibly secondary to significant post-procedure bleeding, but responded well to packed red blood cell transfusions. Other possible etiologies for his hemodynamic compromise include cardiogenic shock, sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or pulmonary embolus. The patient's respiratory status is also unstable, with an unclear etiology, and there are concerns about possible left-sided pneumonia. Additionally, the patient has a history of radiation cystitis, transaminitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, chronic pain, prostate cancer, DVT/PE, pressure ulcer, obstructive sleep apnea, stomach AVM and GIB, and depression. The patient's code status is DNR, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation with fentanyl infusion for pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemic shock: The patient initially presented with tachycardia, hypotension, and cool extremities, which responded to packed red blood cell transfusions. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause of the hypovolemic shock, as it could be due to acute blood loss from the nephrostomy tube placement or other factors.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to
   bone and liver, h/o DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI
   from radiation cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic
   instability and failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy
   tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities.  With fever and persistently positive bacteremia most
   likely etiology  is sepsis. Initially was thought to be hypovolemic
   shock in the setting of significant post-procedure bleed.  However, Hct
   responded well to PRBC transfusions and has been stable. Elevated
   lactate suggests tissue hypoxia although has trended down. Imaging
   shows new hemorrhage in bladder wall and LUL PNA and hematoma.
   - Still with poor urine output, trying to refrain from further fluid
   resuscitation due to anasarca, only current IVF are Abx.
   - Wean Levophed to goal MAP of >60. Now off Neo
   - Trend CVP, Lactate, urine output
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25-30%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test
   - Vancomycin and Zosyn, for broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, and
   adding Aztreonam for double coverage of gm negative rods. Consider
   change Abx to Dapto to cover possible VRE given persistently positive
   GPC, Enterococcus on blood cx while on Vanco
   - Follow-up cultures and [**Last Name (un) **]
   #Respiratory failure: On minimal vent settings at this point but would
   not extubate at this time [**2-10**] hemodynamic instability. Also CXR and CT
   c/w LUL PNA.  Currently stable on PSV. Has gross anasarca and pleural
   effusions, risk for pulmonary edema but cannot diurese [**2-10**] hemodynamic
   instability, pressor requirement.
   - Follow ABGs
   - CXR in the morning
   - Daily SBTs, RSBIs.
   - Wean vent as tolerated but continue intubation for now given
   hemodynamic instability.
   ##Radiation cystitis: Pt has gross hematuria from radiation cystitis.
   Per urology, urine is clearer s/p formalin instillation to bladder on
   [**2170-10-19**]. Hct has been stable.
   - Trend Hct  [**Hospital1 **]
   - Nephrostomy tube in place, catheter care as per IR.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Appreciate Urology input, IR recs
   - Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms
   .
   ## Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden). Given
   minimal utility of trending LFTs, will stop monitoring daily LFTs at
   this point..
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  when off sedation
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <25 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding

   ## Chronic Pain:Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer, currently
   on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   -resume Methadone 10 mg PO BID
   -continue Morpine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   -continue oxybutynin, belladona, gabapentin
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated
   (dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, who presented to the ICU for hemodynamic instability and failure to extubate after an IR procedure to place a right nephrostomy tube. He is currently intubated and on minimal vent settings. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely secondary to a urinary tract infection, as indicated by fever, positive blood cultures, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging shows new hemorrhage in the bladder wall and left upper lobe pneumonia.

The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with gross anasarca and pleural effusions, putting him at risk for pulmonary edema. He is currently stable on pressure-controlled ventilation with spontaneous breaths. The plan is to wean the vent as tolerated but continue intubation due to hemodynamic instability.

The patient has a history of radiation cystitis, for which he received formalin instillation to the bladder. He also has anemia and thrombocytopenia likely secondary to his underlying malignancy and bony involvement.

The patient's other medical conditions include transaminitis, chronic pain, obstructive sleep apnea, history of DVT/PE, pressure ulcer, h/o stomach AVM and GIB, and depression. He is currently on IV fentanyl for pain control and has a code status of full code.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. He is experiencing fever, hypotension, respiratory failure, and sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, ceftriaxone, and daptomycin. He is also receiving infusions of fentanyl and norepinephrine. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the recent fever. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 78/45-119/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg, total fluid intake of 2,201 mL, total fluid output of 2,975 mL, urine output of 2,775 mL, and a negative fluid balance of -774 mL. The patient's blood cultures show VRE and Klebsiella, and he has been switched to a new antibiotic regimen of daptomycin and ceftriaxone. An echocardiogram has been ordered due to persistent bacteremia. The patient's laboratory values indicate leukocytosis with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to
   bone and liver, h/o DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI
   from radiation cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic
   instability and failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy
   tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities.  With fever and persistently positive bacteremia most
   likely etiology  is sepsis. Initially was thought to be hypovolemic
   shock in the setting of significant post-procedure bleed.  However, Hct
   responded well to PRBC transfusions and has been stable. Elevated
   lactate suggests tissue hypoxia although has trended down. Imaging
   shows new hemorrhage in bladder wall and LUL PNA and hematoma.
   - Still with poor urine output, trying to refrain from further fluid
   resuscitation due to anasarca, only current IVF are Abx.

   #Respiratory failure: On minimal vent settings at this point but would
   not extubate at this time [**2-10**] hemodynamic instability. Currently stable
   on PSV. Has gross anasarca and pleural effusions, risk for pulmonary
   edema but cannot diurese [**2-10**] hemodynamic instability and pressor
   requirement.
   - Follow ABGs
   - CXR in the morning
   - Daily SBTs, RSBIs.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial today.
   ##Radiation cystitis: Pt has gross hematuria from radiation cystitis.
   Per urology, urine is clearer s/p formalin instillation to bladder on
   [**2170-10-19**]. Hct trending downward.
   - Trend Hct  [**Hospital1 **]
   - Nephrostomy tube in place, catheter care as per IR; per their note
   yesterday they are considering placing a contralateral nephrostomy
   tube, however, pt. remains unstable and it is unclear how the tube
   would benefit him and could potentially cause further problems given
   the difficulties associated with placing the first tube.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Appreciate Urology input, IR recs
   - Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms
   .
   ## Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden). Given
   minimal utility of trending LFTs, will stop monitoring daily LFTs at
   this point..
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  when off sedation
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.  Platelets now 61 post platelet transfusion.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   -stop Methadone 10 mg PO BID  given somnolence.
   -continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   -continue oxybutynin, belladonna, gabapentin
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated
   (dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan).

   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.  IVC filter in place.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver, previous deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place, radiation cystitis, and chronic pain. The patient is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for hemodynamic instability and failure to extubate following an irrigation procedure for a right nephrostomy tube placement.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient is tachycardic, hypotensive, and has cool extremities. The most likely etiology is sepsis, indicated by fever and persistently positive bacteremia. Imaging shows new hemorrhage in the bladder wall and left upper lobe pneumonia with a hematoma.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on minimal vent settings but cannot be extubated due to hemodynamic instability. There is a risk for pulmonary edema due to gross anasarca and pleural effusions.

3. Radiation cystitis: The patient has gross hematuria from radiation cystitis, which has been treated with formalin instillation to the bladder. There is a concern for further bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to
   bone and liver, h/o DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI
   from radiation cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic
   instability and failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy
   tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities.  With fever and persistently positive bacteremia most
   likely etiology  is sepsis. Initially was thought to be hypovolemic
   shock in the setting of significant post-procedure bleed.  However, Hct
   responded well to PRBC transfusions and has been stable. Elevated
   lactate suggests tissue hypoxia although has trended down. Imaging
   shows new hemorrhage in bladder wall and LUL PNA and hematoma.
   - Still with poor urine output, trying to refrain from further fluid
   resuscitation due to anasarca, only current IVF are Abx.

   #Respiratory failure: On minimal vent settings at this point but would

   on PSV. Has gross anasarca and pleural effusions, risk for pulmonary
   edema but cannot diurese [**2-10**] hemodynamic instability and pressor
   requirement.
   - Follow ABGs
   - CXR in the morning
   - Daily SBTs, RSBIs.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial today.
   ##Radiation cystitis: Pt has gross hematuria from radiation cystitis.
   Per urology, urine is clearer s/p formalin instillation to bladder on
   [**2170-10-19**]. Hct trending downward.
   - Trend Hct  [**Hospital1 **]
   - Nephrostomy tube in place, catheter care as per IR; per their note
   yesterday they are considering placing a contralateral nephrostomy
   tube, however, pt. remains unstable and it is unclear how the tube
   would benefit him and could potentially cause further problems given
   the difficulties associated with placing the first tube.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Appreciate Urology input, IR recs
   - Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms

   ## Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden). Given
   minimal utility of trending LFTs, will stop monitoring daily LFTs at
   this point..
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  when off sedation
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.  Platelets now 61 post platelet transfusion.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding

   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   -stop Methadone 10 mg PO BID  given somnolence.
   -continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   -continue oxybutynin, belladonna, gabapentin
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated
   (dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver. He has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. The patient is not anticoagulated. He is on chronic pain management with IV fentanyl and was previously stable on his home regimen. He has gross hematuria from radiation cystitis and a nephrostomy tube has been placed. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for hemodynamic instability and failure to extubate after an intravenous (IV) procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile, tachycardic, hypotensive, and has persistently positive bacteremia. These signs suggest a potential infection leading to sepsis. Initial thought was hypovolemic shock due to significant post-procedure bleed, but the patient's Hct responded well to packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions and has been stable. Elevated lactate suggests tissue hypoxia, indicating possible sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on minimal ventilator settings and would not extubate due to hemodynamic instability. He has gross anasarca and pleural effusions, which increase the risk for pulmonary edema. The patient is currently stable on pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer to bone and liver, a history of DVT/PE, radiation cystitis, and chronic pain. He is currently in the ICU for hemodynamic instability and failure to extubate after an IR procedure. The patient is intubated and sedated, with cool extremities and mild temperature. He has a history of sepsis and is receiving multiple antibiotics. His respiratory status is improving, but he is still dependent on minimal vent settings. The patient has anemia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, and chronic pain. He has a history of stomach AVM and GIB, depression, obstructive sleep apnea, and pressure ulcers. His code status is full code, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement or decisions about the direction of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently showing signs of hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and response to treatment is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory status is improving, he is still dependent on minimal vent settings. There is a risk of reintubation if he decompensates. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) and respiratory system assessment with blood gases (RSBIs) should be conducted to assess his readiness for extubation.
3. Bleeding: The patient has thrombocytopenia and a history of acute blood loss. Close monitoring of platelet count and careful consideration of any invasive procedures or medications that may increase the risk of bleeding are necessary.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has transaminitis likely secondary to hepatic involvement of prostate cancer. Monitoring liver enzymes and symptoms of liver failure, such as encephalopathy, is important.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to underlying malignancy, bony involvement, and acute blood loss. Transfusion should be considered if Hct <22 or in the setting of active bleeding.
6. Pressure Ulcers: The patient has a stage II pressure ulcer. Regular turning, use of appropriate dressings, and prevention strategies are necessary to prevent further skin breakdown.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of stomach AVM and GIB. Close monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as melena or hematemesis, is necessary.
8. Depression: The patient has a history of depression. Assessment and management of his mental health are important to provide holistic care.

The Answer is: The potential medical complications include sepsis, respiratory failure, bleeding, liver dysfunction, anemia, pressure ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, and depression."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to
   bone and liver, h/o DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI
   from radiation cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic
   instability and failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy
   tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities, persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to
   sepsis.   Requiring less levophed than yesterday; urine output
   improved.
   - Cont. Dapto to for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella
   - Cont. to wean levophed to goal MAP of >60.
   - Trend CVP, Lactate, urine output
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >22%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test;
   megace stopped [**11-5**]
   - Follow-up cultures and [**Last Name (un) **]
   #Respiratory failure: On minimal vent settings at this point.
   Considering extubation, but would not reintubate patient if he
   decompensates.  Need to discuss with family.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial today.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Consider CXR in the morning
   - Daily SBTs, RSBIs.
   ##Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Will
   consider removing tube as goals of care discussed with family this
   afternoon.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms
   .
   ##. Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt. is only stooling small amounts
   - increase bowel regimen.
   .
   ## Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden). Given
   minimal utility of trending LFTs, will stop monitoring daily LFTs at
   this point..
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  when off sedation
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.  Platelets now 42.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding; will transfuse platelets if nephrostomy tube is to be
   removed.
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   -Methadone 10 mg PO BID  stopped [**11-5**] given somnolence.
   -continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   -continue oxybutynin, belladonna, gabapentin
   -start fentanyl 25 mcg patch
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been placed on a DNR/DNI status. The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, retroperitoneal bleed, respiratory failure, hypotension, sepsis with organ dysfunction, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's fever has been persistent, with a temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving multiple antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and an elevated heart rate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Impaired skin integrity: This can lead to pressure ulcers or bedsores, which are common in immobile patients, especially those on mechanical ventilation. Regular turning and proper cushioning should be implemented to prevent further skin breakdown.

2. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient has a nephrostomy tube in place, which could potentially cause bleeding in the retroperitoneal space. Monitoring of vital signs, especially blood pressure, and close observation for signs of hemodynamic instability is crucial. If bleeding continues, further evaluation by interventional radiology may be necessary.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to ensure adequate gas exchange. Adjustments to ventilator settings may be required based on"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to bone and liver, h/o
   DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI from radiation
   cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and
   failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities, persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to
   sepsis.   Requiring less levophed than yesterday; urine output
   improved.
   - Cont. Dapto to for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella
   - Cont. to wean levophed to goal MAP of >60.
   - Trend CVP, Lactate, urine output
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >22%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test;
   megace stopped [**11-5**]
   - Follow-up cultures and [**Last Name (un) **]
   #Respiratory failure: On minimal vent settings at this point.
   Considering extubation, but would not reintubate patient if he
   decompensates.  Need to discuss with family.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial today.
   - Follow ABGs
   - Consider CXR in the morning
   - Daily SBTs, RSBIs.
   ##Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Will
   consider removing tube as goals of care discussed with family this
   afternoon.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms
   .
   ##. Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt. is only stooling small amounts
   - increase bowel regimen.
   .
   ## Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden). Given
   minimal utility of trending LFTs, will stop monitoring daily LFTs at
   this point..
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  when off sedation
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.  Platelets now 42.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding; will transfuse platelets if nephrostomy tube is to be
   removed.
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   -Methadone 10 mg PO BID  stopped [**11-5**] given somnolence.
   -continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   -continue oxybutynin, belladonna, gabapentin
   -start fentanyl 25 mcg patch
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated
   (dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan).
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.  IVC filter in place.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing. Changed to aero bec
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
   his ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes: Remove OGT and place NGT; hold TFs if pt. to be extubated
   today; replete lytes prn. Will calculate free water bolus and increase
   free water with TFs; F/U Nutrition Consult/recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, who is currently in the ICU for hemodynamic instability and respiratory failure. He has a history of DVT/PE, radiation cystitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, chronic pain, obstructive sleep apnea, stomach AVM, GIB, depression, and is currently on multiple medications. The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, tachycardia, cool extremities, mild temperature, sepsis, and respiratory failure. He is intubated and on minimal ventilator settings. The patient's family meeting occurred, and the code status was changed from DNR to Full Code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe immune response to infection. It is characterized by symptoms such as fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and cool extremities.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, as indicated by his need for mechanical ventilation and minimal vent settings. This can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's tachycardia, hypotension, and cool extremities suggest hemodynamic instability. This instability can be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to bone and liver, h/o
   DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI from radiation
   cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and
   failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities, persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to
   sepsis.   Requiring levophed for pressor support; has good urine
   output.  Blood cultures from [**11-4**] with enterococcus faecium.  Sputum
   from [**11-5**] with rare GNRs.
   - Cont. Dapto to for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella
   - Cont. to wean levophed to goal MAP of >60.
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >22%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test;
   megace stopped [**11-5**]
   - surveillance cultures
   - will attempt to keep Is/Os even today given that yesterday was -1.4 L
   without diuretics.
   #Respiratory failure: On minimal vent settings at this point.
   Considering extubation, but would not reintubate patient if he
   decompensates.  Family is aware of status and would like to be present
   for extubation.  Likely patient will be able to breath on own given SBT
   yesterday was tolerated well.
   - plan for extubation when family is present in next 24-48 hours.
   ##Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Per IR,
   will not remove tube given risk of developing urinoma and risk of
   bleeding.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms
   .
   ##. Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt is not having bowel movements.
   - continue to monitor, bowel regimen
   .
   ## Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden). Given
   minimal utility of trending LFTs, will stop monitoring daily LFTs at
   this point..
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  when off sedation
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.  Platelets now 26.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding; will transfuse platelets if nephrostomy tube is to be
   removed.
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   -Methadone 10 mg PO BID  stopped [**11-5**] given somnolence.
   -continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   -continue oxybutynin, belladonna, gabapentin
   -start fentanyl 25 mcg patch
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated
   (dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan).
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.  IVC filter in place.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing. Changed to aero bed.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
   his ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes; NGT; hold TFs if pt. to be extubated today; replete lytes
   prn. F/U Nutrition Consult/recs
   .
   ## Access: A-line placed [**11-5**]; triple lumen RIGHT IJ placed [**2170-10-15**];
   RIGHT PICC placed [**2170-10-31**] and removed.
   ## Code status: DNR/DNI (pt currently intubated, would not re-intubate
   .

   Code status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver, who was admitted to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and failure to extubate after undergoing an IR procedure of a right nephrostomy tube placement. The patient has a history of DVT/PE, radiation cystitis, and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool extremities, and has persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to sepsis. Blood cultures from 11/4 with enterococcus faecium and sputum from 11/5 with rare GNRs suggest potential infections.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on minimal vent settings and is being considered for extubation. However, reintubation may be necessary if he decompensates.
3. Radiation cystitis: The patient has a history of radiation cystitis, and the urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube as it may be contributing to the patient's current sepsis. However, the IR will not remove the tube due to the risk of developing urinoma and risk of bleeding.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient is not having bowel movements, which could indicate bowel obstruction or other gastrointestinal issues.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with metastatic prostate cancer, admitted with polymicrobial sepsis and hemorrhagic cystitis. She has been on a ventilator and the family is moving towards comfort measures. The patient has a fever of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, and her vital signs include a heart rate of 121 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has a history of allergies to ciprofloxacin and latex, as well as unknown allergies. She is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and norepinephrine. She is also on several other medications including neurontin, folate, lactulose, nystatin, hydrocortisone, fentanyl patch, and pantoprazole.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. Her flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of -1426 mL over the past 24 hours. Her respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 541 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 53, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of pH 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 30 mmHg, oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) of 145 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 16 mEq/L.

Physical examination findings include jaundice, distended abdomen, warm skin, and a right lower extremity edema grade 4+. Neurologic examination reveals the patient responding to verbal stimuli, opening her eyes to voice, and showing non-purposeful movement. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 4.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 28%, platelet (Plt) count of 36 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 101 mg/dL, and several other abnormal values indicating possible organ dysfunction or infection.

Microbiology results indicate the presence of enterococcus in the blood culture on November 4th, but it has since become negative. The patient's assessment and plan include retroperitoneal bleed, procedure-related fever, respiratory failure, acute septic shock, anemia, bladder obstruction, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, worsening septic shock, development of organ dysfunction, and complications related to her underlying malignancy."

   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test;
   megace stopped [**11-5**]
   - Follow cultures and keep Is/Os even.
    #Respiratory failure: On minimal vent settings at this point.  Family
   is aware of status and would like to be present for extubation.  Likely
   patient will be able to breath on own given SBT yesterday was tolerated
   well.
   - Plan for extubation when family is present in next 24-48 hours.
   #Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Per IR,
   will not remove tube given risk of developing urinoma and risk of
   bleeding.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms held while intubated and
   sedated.
   .
   # Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt is not having bowel movements, and
   has hypoactive BS.
   - Will continue to monitor, and administer bowel regimen.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden).
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  once sedations is weaned.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.  Platelets now 66 post transfusion from 15.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding; will transfuse platelets if nephrostomy tube is to be
   removed.
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   - Methadone 10 mg PO BID stopped [**11-5**] given somnolence.
   - continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   - Hold oxybutynin, belladonna while intubated and sedated.
   - Cont. gabapentin
   - Start fentanyl 25 mcg patch
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated
   (dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan).

   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.  IVC filter in place.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver. He has a history of DVT/PE, radiation cystitis, chronic pain, obstructive sleep apnea, stomach AVM, gastrointestinal bleeding, depression, and pressure ulcers. The patient is currently in the ICU due to hemodynamic instability and respiratory failure. He is intubated and requires pressor support with levophed. The patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells and platelets. He is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics for suspected infections, pain management, and treatment of radiation cystitis. His laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia, hypotension, and cool extremities may indicate sepsis. His blood cultures have grown enterococcus faecium and his sputum culture showed rare GNRs. He is already on antibiotics for suspected infections.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on minimal vent settings and is expected to be extubated within the next 24-48 hours. There is a risk of post-extubation complications such as airway obstruction or respiratory distress.
3. Radiation cystitis: The patient has a history of radiation cystitis and his urologist recommends removing the nephrostomy tube as it may be contributing to"

   Assessment and Plan
 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to bone and liver, h/o
   DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI from radiation
   cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and
   failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities, persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to
   sepsis.   Requiring levophed for pressor support; has good urine
   output.  Blood cultures from [**11-4**] with enterococcus faecium.  Sputum
   from [**11-5**] with rare GNRs.
   - Cont. Dapto to for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella
   - Cont. to wean levophed to goal MAP of >60.
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >22%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test;
   megace stopped [**11-5**]
   - surveillance cultures
   - will attempt to keep Is/Os even today given that yesterday was -1.4 L
   without diuretics.
   #Respiratory failure: On minimal vent settings at this point.
   Considering extubation, but would not reintubate patient if he
   decompensates.  Family is aware of status and would like to be present
   for extubation.  Likely patient will be able to breath on own given SBT
   yesterday was tolerated well.
   - plan for extubation when family is present in next 24-48 hours.
   ##Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Per IR,
   will not remove tube given risk of developing urinoma and risk of
   bleeding.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not

   - Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms
   .
   ##. Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt is not having bowel movements.
   - continue to monitor, bowel regimen
   .
   ## Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden). Given
   minimal utility of trending LFTs, will stop monitoring daily LFTs at
   this point..
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  when off sedation
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.  Platelets now 26.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding; will transfuse platelets if nephrostomy tube is to be
   removed.
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   -Methadone 10 mg PO BID  stopped [**11-5**] given somnolence.
   -continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   -continue oxybutynin, belladonna, gabapentin

   Assessment and Plan
 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to bone and liver, h/o
   DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI from radiation
   cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and
   failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities, persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to
   sepsis.   Requiring levophed for pressor support; has good urine
   output.  Blood cultures from [**11-4**] with enterococcus faecium.  Sputum
   from [**11-5**] with rare GNRs.
   - Cont. Dapto to for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella
   - Cont. to wean levophed to goal MAP of >60.
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >22%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test;
   megace stopped [**11-5**]
   - Follow cultures and keep Is/Os even.
    #Respiratory failure: On minimal vent settings at this point.  Family
   is aware of status and would like to be present for extubation.  Likely
   patient will be able to breath on own given SBT yesterday was tolerated
   well.
   - Plan for extubation when family is present in next 24-48 hours.
   #Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Per IR,
   will not remove tube given risk of developing urinoma and risk of
   bleeding.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Ditropan and Belladonna for bladder spasms held while intubated and
   sedated.
   .
   # Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt is not having bowel movements, and
   has hypoactive BS.
   - Will continue to monitor, and administer bowel regimen.
   .
   #Transaminitis: Elevated but stable. Likely secondary to hepatic
   involvement of prostate cancer (significant tumor burden).
   - Monitor for encephalopathy  once sedations is weaned.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen to maintain regular stools
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.  Platelets now 66 post transfusion from 15.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding; will transfuse platelets if nephrostomy tube is to be
   removed.
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   - Methadone 10 mg PO BID stopped [**11-5**] given somnolence.
   - continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   - Hold oxybutynin, belladonna while intubated and sedated.
   - Cont. gabapentin
   - Start fentanyl 25 mcg patch
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated
   (dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan).
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   - Will email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] to update on pt status.
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.  IVC filter in place.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing. Changed to aero bed.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
   his ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes:  NGT; hold TFs given probable extubation and high
   residuals; replete lytes prn. F/U Nutrition Consult/recs
   .
   ## Access: A-line placed [**11-5**]; triple lumen RIGHT IJ placed [**2170-10-15**];
   RIGHT PICC placed [**2170-10-31**] and removed.
   ## Code status: DNR/DNI (pt currently intubated, would not
   re-intubate).
   .
   ## Communication: [**Doctor First Name 16**]-Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5836**].

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with widely metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver. He has a history of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), radiation cystitis, and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient is currently in the ICU for hemodynamic instability and respiratory failure following an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/52 mmHg to 116/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on face tent. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's physical examination reveals pitting edema in both lower extremities, cool extremities, diffuse ecchymoses, mild hepatomegaly, and jaundice. Laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and kidney dysfunction.

The patient's assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient is tachycardic, hypotensive, and has cool extremities, likely secondary to sepsis. He requires levophed for pressor support and has good urine output. Blood cultures show enterococcus faecium, and sputum cultures"

   Multi Lumen - [**2170-11-1**] 11:00 PM
","The patient is a 52-year-old male with widely metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver, a history of DVT/PE (deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism), and currently being treated for radiation cystitis. He was transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and failure to extubate following an IR placement of a right nephrostomy tube.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool extremities, most likely secondary to sepsis. He requires levophed for pressor support, has good urine output, and blood cultures from 11/4 with enterococcus faecium. Sputum from 11/5 with rare GNRs.

Plan:
- Continue Dapto for VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) and CTX for Klebsiella.
- Wean levophed to goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >60.
- Transfuse to keep hematocrit (Hct) >22%.
- Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test; megace stopped 11/5.
- Follow cultures and keep intake/output (I/O) even.

2. Respiratory failure: Supportive measures with Oxygen and nebs, but the patient is now DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate).

3. Radiation cystitis: Uro"

   Assessment and Plan
 52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to bone and liver, h/o
   DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI from radiation
   cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and
   failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities, persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to
   sepsis.   Requiring levophed for pressor support; has good urine
   output.  Blood cultures from [**11-4**] with enterococcus faecium.  Sputum
   from [**11-5**] with rare GNRs.
   - Cont. Dapto to for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella
   - Cont. to wean levophed to goal MAP of >60.
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >22%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test;
   megace stopped [**11-5**]
   - Follow cultures and keep Is/Os even.
   #Respiratory failure: Supportive measures with Oxygen and nebs, but
   patient is now DNR/DNI.
   #Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Per IR,
   will not remove tube given risk of developing urinoma and risk of
   bleeding.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Cont. CBI.
   .
   # Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt is not having bowel movements, and
   has hypoactive BS.
   - Will continue to monitor, and administer bowel regimen.
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.  Platelets now 66 post transfusion from 15.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding;
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   - continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   - Hold oxybutynin, belladonna while intubated and sedated.
   - Cont. gabapentin
   - Start fentanyl 25 mcg patch
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated
   (dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan).
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   - Will email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] to update on pt status.
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.  IVC filter in place.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing. Changed to aero bed.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
   his ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of cancer who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been deteriorating over the past few days. The patient has pancypopenia (low levels of all blood cell types), impaired skin integrity, a retroperitoneal bleed, fever, respiratory failure, hypotension, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The presence of fever and severe sepsis indicates a high risk for infection. The patient may be susceptible to further infections due to immunosuppression from pancypopenia.
2. Bleeding: The retroperitoneal bleed could lead to significant blood loss and may require urgent intervention. The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Respiratory distress: The respiratory failure indicates difficulty in breathing and may necessitate mechanical ventilation. This puts the patient at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Organ dysfunction: Severe sepsis can lead to organ failure, particularly in vital organs such as the kidneys, liver, and heart. Monitoring of organ function through laboratory tests is essential.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring and appropriate hemodynamic support to ensure adequate tissue perfusion.
6. Cancer progression: The patient's history of prostate cancer suggests a possibility of disease progression, which can complicate the overall"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to bone and liver, h/o
   DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI from radiation
   cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and
   failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities, persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to
   sepsis.   Requiring levophed for pressor support; has good urine
   output.  Blood cultures from [**11-4**] with enterococcus faecium.  Sputum
   from [**11-5**] with rare GNRs.
   - Cont. Dapto to for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >22%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test
   - Follow cultures and keep Is/Os even.
   #Respiratory failure: Supportive measures with Oxygen and nebs, but
   patient is now DNR/DNI.
   #Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Per IR,
   will not remove tube given risk of developing urinoma and risk of
   bleeding.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation
   - Cont. CBI.
   .
   # Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt is not having bowel movements, and
   has hypoactive BS.
   - Will continue to monitor, and administer bowel regimen.
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding;
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   - Cont. gabapentin
   - Increase fentanyl to 50 mcg patch.
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated
   (dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan).
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   - Will email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] to update on pt status.
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.  IVC filter in place.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing. Changed to aero bed.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
   his ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes:  NGT; hold TFs given probable extubation and high
   residuals; replete lytes prn. F/U Nutrition Consult/recs
   .
   ## Access: A-line placed [**11-5**]; triple lumen RIGHT IJ placed [**2170-10-15**];
   RIGHT PICC placed [**2170-10-31**] and removed.
   ## Code status: DNR/DNI (pt currently intubated, would not
   re-intubate).
   .
   ## Communication: [**Doctor First Name 16**]-Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5836**].

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to bone and liver, h/o
   DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI from radiation
   cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and
   failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities, persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to
   sepsis.   Requiring levophed for pressor support; has good urine
   output.  Blood cultures from [**11-4**] with enterococcus faecium.  Sputum
   from [**11-5**] with rare GNRs.
   - Cont. Dapto to for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >22%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test
   - Follow cultures and keep Is/Os even.
   #Respiratory failure: Supportive measures with Oxygen and nebs, but
   patient is now DNR/DNI.
   #Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Per IR,
   will not remove tube given risk of developing urinoma and risk of
   bleeding.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation
   - Cont. CBI.
   .
   # Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt is not having bowel movements, and
   has hypoactive BS.
   - Will continue to monitor, and administer bowel regimen.
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding;
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   - Cont. gabapentin
   - Increase fentanyl to 50 mcg patch.
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated
   (dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan).
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   - Will email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] to update on pt status.
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.  IVC filter in place.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing. Changed to aero bed.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
   his ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes:  NGT; hold TFs given probable extubation and high
   residuals; replete lytes prn. F/U Nutrition Consult/recs
   .
   ## Access: A-line placed [**11-5**]; triple lumen RIGHT IJ placed [**2170-10-15**];
   RIGHT PICC placed [**2170-10-31**] and removed.
   ## Code status: DNR/DNI (pt currently intubated, would not
   re-intubate).
   .
   ## Communication: [**Doctor First Name 16**]-Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5836**].

   add the following points: 52M met prostate cancer c/b ongoing
   septic/hemorrhagic shock after R nephrostomy tube placement. Blood
   cultures have grown VRE and klebsiella. Transfused for BRBPR x1.
   Remains on levophed, but dose is slowly decreasing.
   Agree with plan to continue dapto / ctx / levophed therapy for sepsis.
   Will monitor hematuria / GIB. Overall prognosis is very poor given
   advanced malignancy c/b hepatic infiltration and ongoing septic shock,
   Will discuss with family further goals of care.  Currently on narcotics
   for pain control.  Can increase fentnyl patch.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer, polymicrobial sepsis, and respiratory failure. He is currently extubated and has made a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) decision with no escalation of care. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with tachycardia, hypotension, and cool extremities. He has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), radiation cystitis, chronic pain, anemia/thrombocytopenia, obstructive sleep apnea, stomach arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), depression, and pressure ulcers. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, liver enzymes, and kidney function. He is on multiple medications, including antibiotics for polymicrobial sepsis, analgesics for pain control, and supportive therapies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with polymicrobial sepsis, and there is a risk of further complications if the infection spreads or if antibiotic therapy is not effective.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and his current condition may worsen if he develops complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's vital signs indicate tachyc"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to bone and liver, h/o
   DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI from radiation
   cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and
   failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities, persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to
   sepsis.   Requiring levophed for pressor support; has good urine
   output.  Blood cultures from [**11-4**] with enterococcus faecium.  Sputum
   from [**11-5**] with rare GNRs.
   - Cont. Dapto to for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >22%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test
   - Follow cultures and keep Is/Os even.
   #Respiratory failure: Supportive measures with Oxygen and nebs, but
   patient is now DNR/DNI.
   #Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Per IR,
   will not remove tube given risk of developing urinoma and risk of
   bleeding.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation
   - Cont. CBI.
   .
   # Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt is not having bowel movements, and
   has hypoactive BS.
   - Will continue to monitor, and administer bowel regimen.
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding;
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.
   - Continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   - Cont. gabapentin
   - Increase fentanyl to 50 mcg patch.
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets. Will slowly reintroduce home pain regimen if extubated
   (dilaudid, oxybutinin, pyridium, methadone, neurontin, ativan).
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   - Will email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] to update on pt status.
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.  IVC filter in place.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing. Changed to aero bed.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
   his ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes:  NGT; hold TFs given probable extubation and high

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer, polymicrobial sepsis, and respiratory failure. He is currently extubated and in the ICU.

The patient has a history of DVT/PE, for which an IVC filter has been placed, and he is no longer anticoagulated. He also has a history of stomach AVM and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), for which he is on PPI therapy. The patient has been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and depression, for which he is taking Celexa.

The patient's current medical issues include hemodynamic instability, respiratory failure, radiation cystitis, abdominal pain, anemia/thrombocytopenia, chronic pain, prostate cancer, pressure ulcer, obstructive sleep apnea, h/o stomach AVM and GIB, and depression.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and cool extremities, suggesting sepsis. Blood cultures have grown enterococcus faecium, and sputum cultures have grown rare GNRs. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella.

The patient's lab results indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate levels, and elevated lactic acid levels.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing antibiotics, transfusing to maintain Hct >22%, providing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver. He has a history of DVT/PE, radiation cystitis, and chronic pain. The patient is currently in the ICU for hemodynamic instability and failure to extubate after an IR placement of a right nephrostomy tube. He has been diagnosed with sepsis and is receiving pressor support with levophed. Blood cultures have grown enterococcus faecium, and sputum cultures have shown rare GNRs. The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with oxygen and nebs, but he is now DNR/DNI. The radiation cystitis is being managed by holding the nephrostomy tube removal due to the risk of developing urinoma and bleeding. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are likely due to underlying malignancy and bony involvement. Chronic pain management involves titrating IV fentanyl as needed. Prostate cancer management involves reintroducing home pain regimen if extubated. The patient's history of DVT/PE has resulted in an IVC filter placement, and he is no longer a candidate for anticoagulation. He also has a pressure ulcer, obstructive sleep apnea, h/o stomach AVM and GIB, and depression. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is pending clinical improvement or decisions about the direction of care.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to bone and liver, h/o
   DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI from radiation
   cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and
   failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities, persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to
   sepsis.   Requiring levophed for pressor support; has good urine
   output.  Blood cultures from [**11-4**] with enterococcus faecium.  Sputum
   from [**11-5**] with rare GNRs.
   - Cont. Dapto to for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >22%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test;
   megace stopped [**11-5**]
   - Follow cultures
   - IVF to support blood pressure, but no further pressors
   #Respiratory failure: Supportive measures with Oxygen and nebs, but
   patient is now DNR/DNI.
   #Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Per IR,
   will not remove tube given risk of developing urinoma and risk of
   bleeding.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Cont. CBI.
   .
   # Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt is not having bowel movements, and
   has hypoactive BS.
   - Will continue to monitor, and administer bowel regimen.
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.  Platelets now 66 post transfusion from 15.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding;
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.  Uptitrating pain
   medications to keep patient comfortable with the understanding that
   such measures will also decrease his blood pressure.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   - continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   - Hold oxybutynin, belladonna while intubated and sedated.
   - Cont. gabapentin
   - Fentanyl 50 mcg patch
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets.
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   - Will email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] to update on pt status.
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.  IVC filter in place.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing. Changed to aero bed.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
   his ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes:  NGT; holding TFs given high residuals; replete lytes
   prn. F/U Nutrition Consult/recs
   .
   ## Access: A-line placed [**11-5**]; triple lumen RIGHT IJ placed [**2170-10-15**];
   RIGHT PICC placed [**2170-10-31**] and removed.
   ## Code status: DNR/DNI; Family still requesting medical interventions
   to prolong life while trying to maintain comfort.  Will continue
   ongoing discussions with family.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 yo M with widely metstatic prostate cancer to bone and liver, h/o
   DVT/PE s/p IVC filter(not anticoagulated), on CBI from radiation
   cystits, being transferred to the MICU for hemodynamic instability and
   failure to extubate s/p IR placement of a R nephrostomy tube.
   #Hemodynamic instability: Tachycardic, hypotensive, with cool
   extremities, persistently mild temperature, most likely secondary to
   sepsis.   Requiring levophed for pressor support; has good urine
   output.  Blood cultures from [**11-4**] with enterococcus faecium.  Sputum
   from [**11-5**] with rare GNRs.
   - Cont. Dapto to for VRE and CTX for Klebsiella
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >22%
   - Stress dose steroids given recent failed cosyntropin stim test;
   megace stopped [**11-5**]
   - Follow cultures
   - IVF to support blood pressure, but no further pressors
   #Respiratory failure: Supportive measures with Oxygen and nebs, but
   patient is now DNR/DNI.
   #Radiation cystitis: Urology recommends removing the nephrostomy tube
   as it may be contributing to the patient
s current sepsis.  Per IR,
   will not remove tube given risk of developing urinoma and risk of
   bleeding.
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation (per his oncologist, pt should not
   receive lovenox)
   - Cont. CBI.
   .
   # Abdominal pain
 Per nursing pt is not having bowel movements, and
   has hypoactive BS.
   - Will continue to monitor, and administer bowel regimen.
   .
   ## Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:. Likely [**2-10**] underlying malignancy and bony
   involvement and possibly acute blood loss in the setting of IR
   procedure.  Platelets now 66 post transfusion from 15.
   - Transfuse active bleeding or Hct <22 or plts <50 in the setting of
   bleeding;
   .
   ## Chronic Pain: Was stable on home regimen prior to transfer,
   currently on IV fentanyl for pain control.  Uptitrating pain
   medications to keep patient comfortable with the understanding that
   such measures will also decrease his blood pressure.
   - Titrate as needed, when able, could resume home regimen:
   - continue Morphine 2-4mg IV q4prn
   - Hold oxybutynin, belladonna while intubated and sedated.
   - Cont. gabapentin
   - Fentanyl 50 mcg patch
   .
   ## Prostate cancer: Patient's cancer has been refractory to all
   therapies thus far. Metastatic to bone now w/ liver lesions concerning
   for mets.
   - F/u recs of oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**]
   - Will email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] to update on pt status.
   .
   ## History of DVT/PE : Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5889**] (oncology) pt is no longer a
   candidate for anticoagulation given recurrent hematuria. He will no
   longer receive lovenox.  IVC filter in place.
   .
   ## Pressure Ulcer: Stage II Left ischial, continue duoderm and Allevyn
   foam dressing. Changed to aero bed.
   .
   ## Obstructive sleep apnea: on CPAP at baseline.
   .
   ## H/o stomach AVM and GIB: continue PPI. Change to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
   his ?GI bleed.
   .
   ## Depression: Continue Celexa
   .
   ## PPx: PPI. Bowel regimen, pneumoboots, Pt has h/o of dvt/pe but no
   longer a candidate for anticoagulation.
   .
   ## FEN/Lytes:  NGT; holding TFs given high residuals; replete lytes
   prn. F/U Nutrition Consult/recs
   .
   ## Access: A-line placed [**11-5**]; triple lumen RIGHT IJ placed [**2170-10-15**];
   RIGHT PICC placed [**2170-10-31**] and removed.
   ## Code status: DNR/DNI; Family still requesting medical interventions
   to prolong life while trying to maintain comfort.  Will continue
   ongoing discussions with family.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with widely metastatic prostate cancer to the bone and liver. He has a history of DVT/PE, radiation cystitis, and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient is currently in the ICU for hemodynamic instability and failure to extubate after the placement of a right nephrostomy tube. He is also experiencing respiratory failure, abdominal pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia, chronic pain, and prostate cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is tachycardic, hypotensive, and has cool extremities, which may indicate sepsis. Blood cultures have grown enterococcus faecium, and sputum cultures have shown rare gram-negative rods. He is already receiving appropriate antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on oxygen and nebs for respiratory support, but he is now DNR/DNI.
3. Radiation Cystitis: The urology team recommends removing the nephrostomy tube as it may be contributing to the patient's current sepsis. However, the interventional radiology team will not remove the tube due to the risk of developing a urinoma and bleeding.
4. Abdominal Pain: The patient has not had bowel movements, and his bowel sounds are hypoactive. He should continue to be monitored, and a bowel regimen should be administered.
5. Anemia/Thrombocyt"
