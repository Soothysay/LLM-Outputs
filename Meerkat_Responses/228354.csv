","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-inch tall and 109 kg weight individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history is unchanged from admission, except for the following notable review of systems. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 77 bpm (59-100 bpm), blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg (66/37-134/94 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (16-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 21 mmHg (9-21 mmHg). 

The patient received two boluses of 500cc for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 48, 52. Allergies were assessed, and no known drug allergies were reported. The patient was administered Vancomycin at [**2102-8-10**] 08:00 PM and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at [**2102-8-11**] 05:12 AM. 

The patient has been receiving various ICU medications, including Morphine Sulfate at [**2102-8-10**] 10:00 PM for pain control and Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis) at [**2102-8-11**] 12:16 AM. 

Flowsheet data indicates that the patient has received a total of 13,861 mL of fluids since midnight, with 6,911 mL given intravenously and 517 mL in the thoracic duct. The patient has also received 1,200 mL of oral fluids. 

The patient's blood cultures were obtained at [**2102-8-10**] 02:01 PM and again at [**2102-8-10**] 04:30 PM. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 29.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 29.7 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) at 429 K/uL. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range at 125 mg/dL. However, the patient's creatinine (Cr) level is elevated at 1.8 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate prolonged prothrombin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR), as well as elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). 

The patient's assessment and plan include pain control, impaired skin integrity, and shock, specifically septic shock. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and positive blood cultures suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infection.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level indicates potential kidney dysfunction.
4. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT/INR suggests a coagulopathy, increasing the risk of bleeding.
5. Liver dysfunction: The elevated AST and ALT levels suggest potential liver dysfunction.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains on the lower side, indicating potential hypotension.
7. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and there is a possibility of respiratory complications due to the use of mechanical ventilation or underlying lung disease.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's impaired nutritional status due to limited oral intake may lead to malnutrition.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on"

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis, currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock. She meets SIRS criteria (temperature, heart rate, white blood cell count) with suspected source being a psoriasis flare with superinfection. Other possible infectious etiologies include a urinary source. Acute generalized pustular psoriasis itself can cause an acute inflammatory response similar to septic shock.

The patient is receiving IV fluids to maintain CVP between 8-12, IV fluid boluses, and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr. Vanc is being administered for empirical coverage of skin flora, while Zosyn is given for GN coverage due to UTI, with plans to narrow coverage pending culture results.

She has a history of pain control (acute pain, chronic pain) and impaired skin integrity. The patient's labs show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. Her blood cultures were obtained at 02:01 PM and 04:30 PM.

The patient is also diagnosed with pustular psoriasis, presumed acute renal failure likely due to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of hypotension/sepsis, and hypertension. Renal dosing of medications and obtaining baseline renal function are recommended.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is NPO with IVF, and glycemic control is not applicable"

   continued adequate u/o.  Would continue maintenance fluids as she has
   significant insensible losses due to skin involvement, though she is
   tolerating Pos.  Would bolus additionally as needed to maintain cvp >
   10, MAP > 60 if BP falls. Given her extensive rash/skin involvement
   would leave her current OSH IJ in place for now, rather than resite. As
   rash heals, would obtain PIVs or picc.  Derm input is appreciated.  We
   await bx results and continue retinoic acid derivative (just now
   available), topical rx and prednisone. Following lfts and lipids. As
   she is recently off pressors, would continue to hold home antihtn
   medication, monitoring BP off pressors. Remainder of plan as outlined

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who presented with septic shock. She has been treated with IV fluids, pressors, and antibiotics for her infection. She also has an acute eruption of pustular psoriasis and a urinary tract infection. The patient's renal failure has resolved, but she requires continued monitoring of her creatinine levels. She has been weaned off pressors and is currently stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock, indicating a severe systemic infection. Although she is currently stable, there is still a risk of further infection and potential complications associated with sepsis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient experienced acute renal failure, which has since resolved. However, close monitoring of her renal function is necessary to ensure that it does not recur.
3. Pustular Psoriasis Flare: The patient has an acute eruption of pustular psoriasis, which can cause inflammation and potentially lead to complications such as skin infections or impaired skin integrity.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI, as indicated by the presence of GNR bacteria in her urine culture. It is important to continue treatment with appropriate antibiotics and monitor for any worsening of symptoms or signs of kidney infection.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may require further management and monitoring, especially"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8880**]
s note and agree
   with his findings and plan of care.  Mrs [**Known lastname 9174**] today looks and feels
   quite well.  Hemodymically she is essentially normal, except for U.O of
   only 30cc/hr which we attribute to excess loss of insensible fluid via
   her inflamed skin.  We will give more IV fluid and blood (Hct only 24)
   to improve what we believe to still be some intravascular volume
   depletion.
   Her psoriasis is much improved with high potency topical steroids under
   occlusion and po prednisone.  We will consult with derm about the
   patient
s slurring of words upon taking Soriatane, to be sure it is
   safe continuing it.
   Her septic shock was likely from staph aureus bacteremia from her
   psoriasis and from a Klebsiella UTI.  We will await final idenfication
   of the organisms and their sensitivities before deciding if a singly
   antibiotic can be used to Rx both infections.  A TTE has been ordered
   to insure there is no evidence of endocarditis.
   If patient continues to look this well, she can be transferred to the
   floor this evening or tomorrow morning.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who presented with septic shock. The patient has been treated for various conditions including:

1. Septic shock: The patient initially met the criteria for sepsis-induced respiratory syndrome (SIRS) with suspected source psoriasis flare with superinfection. Other possible infectious etiologies include a urinary source. The patient has received IV fluids, Levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65, and urinary output (UOP) > 30cc/hr. Antibiotics have been started empirically for skin flora coverage and Klebsiella coverage.

2. Acute eruption of pustular psoriasis: The patient is being treated with Soriatane 50, prednisone 10 mg daily, clobetasol, and wound care recommendations from dermatology. The patient's slurred speech post-Soriatane is being monitored.

3. Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: The patient is on vancomycin, and sensitivities are being awaited.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a growing gram-negative rod (GNR) in urine, which is pan-sensitive Klebsiella. She is on ciprofloxacin.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who is currently in the ICU for septic shock. The patient is stable without any pressor requirements and has met SIRS criteria (temp, HR, WBC) with suspected source psoriasis flare with superinfection. Other possible infectious etiologies include a urinary source. The patient is receiving IV fluids to maintain CVP 8-12, IV fluid boluses and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr, and is on Vanc and Zosyn for empiric coverage of skin flora and GN coverage given UTI, respectively.

The patient also has an acute eruption of pustular psoriasis, for which she is prescribed Soriatane 50, Prednisone 10 mg daily, Clobetasol, and wound care per dermatology recommendations. Additionally, the patient has a UTI with growing GNR in urine and is on Zosyn. The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, likely due to ATN in the setting of hypotension/sepsis. She is advised to continue trending Cr.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis admitted to the ICU for septic shock. She presented with suspected source psoriasis flare with superinfection and met SIRS criteria (temp, HR, WBC). Other possible infectious etiologies include urinary source. The patient has received IV fluids, Levophed, Vanc, and Zosyn. She is currently stable without any pressor requirements. The patient also has an acute eruption of pustular psoriasis and a UTI with GNR in the urine. She has been started on Prednisone and continues with wound care per dermatology recommendations. The patient previously had acute renal failure, which has resolved, likely due to ATN in the setting of hypotension/sepsis. Her blood cultures showed no growth, while urine and OSH cultures are pending. The patient's hypertension will be managed by holding antihypertensives in the acute setting."

   This is a 64 yo female with a history of pustular psoriasis here with
   septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Resolved, hemodynamially stable. Currently stable
   without any pressor requirements. Upon presentation, patient met SIRS
   criteria (temp, HR, WBC) with suspected source psoriasis flare with
   superinfection.  Other possible infectious etiologies include urinary
   source.  Of note, acute generalized pustular psoriasis in it of itself
   can cause a similar presentation of acute inflammatory response.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Check mix venous sat if < 70%, transfuse for Hct > 30
   - Vanc (started [**8-10**]) for empric coverage of skin flora
   - Cipro (coverage since [**8-10**]) for Klebsiella coverage
   - f/u culture data from OSH and [**Hospital1 19**]
   - Cont OSH CVL for now. Need to keep for access.
   .
   # Acute eruption of Pustular psoriasis: Per dermatology note, feel that
   this is more consistent with pustular psoriasis flare with
   superinfection than generalized pustular psoriasis.  Had slurred
   speech, flushing and pruritic reaction post-Soriatane. Says normal for
   her.
   - Continue  Soriatane 50. f/u with derm about soriatane side effects
   before next dose.
   - Prednisone 10 mg daily (started [**8-10**])
   - Continue Clobetasol
   - Continue Morphine PRN for pain
   - Wound care per dermatology recommendations

   --On Cipro (started [**8-10**])
   # Acute renal failure: Initially,  likely [**2-13**] ATN in setting of
   hypotension/sepsis.  Had low UOP despite boluses. Increase in Cr today
   from 1.1
   - Increase maintainence fluids to NS @200 cc/hr.

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who presented with septic shock. She was initially hemodynamically unstable but has now stabilized without the need for pressor support. The patient met SIRS criteria (temperature, heart rate, and white blood cell count) and had a suspected source of infection related to a psoriasis flare with superinfection. Other possible infectious etiologies include a urinary source.

The patient's current medical conditions include septic shock, which has resolved, and acute renal failure. The renal failure is likely a type 2 acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension/sepsis. The patient's urine output remains low despite fluid boluses, and there has been an increase in creatinine levels today.

The patient's pain control is being managed with morphine PRN, and she is also receiving prednisone 10 mg daily for her acute pustular psoriasis flare. The wound care for her skin condition is being provided per dermatology recommendations.

Regarding her infectious etiologies, the patient has Staphylococcus aureus in her blood culture, which is currently being treated with vancomycin. The sensitivity results for this organism are pending. Additionally, there is a growing Gram-negative rod in her urine culture, which is pan-sensitive Klebsiella. This infection is being treated with ciprofloxacin.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient presented with intermittent chest pain lasting for 10 minutes, which was reproducible on the left side of the chest and did not radiate. No associated symptoms were reported. The EKG showed no changes.

The patient also experienced pruritus post-Soriatane and verbal slurring, but it was not clear if these symptoms were related to the medication. The patient had low urine output (UOP), so they were given 500cc normal saline boluses and increased IV fluids from 100 to 200cc/hr. The patient's CVP range was 12-26, HR was 50-60, and SBP was 130-140.

The patient's allergies included no known drug allergies. They received Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 02:00 PM on [**2102-8-11**] and Vancomycin at 08:30 PM on the same day.

The patient was receiving various infusions, including Pantoprazole (Protonix), Morphine sulfate, and Heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

The patient's review of systems remained unchanged from admission except for the chest pain mentioned earlier. Flow sheet data showed vital signs within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.8C (98.2F) and current temperature of 36.3C (97.4F). The patient's weight was 109"

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of intermittent chest pain lasting 10 minutes, reproducible on the left side of the chest. The patient does not have any associated symptoms and the EKG remains unchanged. The patient also reports pruritis post-Soriatane and verbal slurring. The patient's low urine output (UOP) shifts prompted the administration of 500cc normal saline (NS) boluses and an increase in intravenous fluid (IVF) from 100 to 200cc/hr. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range, heart rate (HR) is between 50-60 beats per minute, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) is 130-140 mmHg. 

The patient has no known drug allergies and received Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) at 02:00 PM on 08/11/2102, followed by Vancomycin at 08:30 PM on the same day. The patient is currently receiving Pantoprazole (Protonix), Morphine Sulfate, and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis). 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the chest pain. Flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, within normal ranges. The patient's weight is currently 109 kg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who is currently in the ICU for septic shock. She has been stable without the need for pressor requirements. The patient initially met SIRS criteria with suspected source of infection being a psoriasis flare with superinfection or a urinary source. The patient's acute generalized pustular psoriasis can also cause a similar presentation of acute inflammatory response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is currently stable but remains at risk for septic shock due to the ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment of any signs of deterioration is crucial.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has had an episode of acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension and sepsis. Regular monitoring of creatinine levels and maintaining adequate fluid balance and blood pressure are important to prevent further renal complications.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a growing gram-negative rod (GNR) in her urine, indicating a possible UTI. It is essential to follow the speciation of the organism and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and it is important to manage her blood pressure carefully in the acute setting. Holding antihypertensive medications for now is recommended.
5. Pustular Psoriasis Flare: The patient is experiencing a pustular ps"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 347**]
s note above and I
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  She is doing very well
   indeed with continued hemodynamic stability and no evidence of
   continued sepsis.  Her bld cx is growing [**Last Name (STitle) 336**] and her urine cx growing
   2 sensitive species of Klebsiella. The plan is to Rx the former with
   nafcillin IV for 14 days, for which a PICC will be needed.  The latter
   organisms are and will be treated with Cipro.
   She
s gotten a lot of IVF for resuscitation over the past 3 days and is
   total body fluid overloaded.  She has mild SOB, CVP of 15, and even her
   mild increase in Creat we think may be due to her being on the
   descending limb of her cardiac Starling curve with decreased forward
   flow to her kidneys (vs some ATN from prior sepsis).  We will thus Rx
   with lasix today, aiming for net I/O of neg 1-2 liters today.
   We think she is stable and well enough to go to the floor, where TTE
   should be done in the next couple of days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis who presented with septic shock. She has been diagnosed with acute generalized pustular psoriasis flare with superinfection, urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella, acute renal failure likely due to hypotension/sepsis, and hypertension. The patient has been treated with IV fluids, antibiotics (nafcillin and ciprofloxacin), and blood transfusions. She is currently hemodynamically stable and her skin lesions have improved. The plan is to continue the current treatment regimen, monitor renal function, and consider a transfer to the floor once stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe infection, low blood pressure, and inadequate tissue perfusion. Although the patient is currently stable, there is still a risk of deterioration if the infection persists or spreads to other areas of the body.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension and sepsis. This condition can lead to a decrease in kidney function, resulting in the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances in the body.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of pustular psoriasis. She presented with septic shock and met SIRS criteria due to suspected psoriasis flare with superinfection. Other possible infectious etiologies include a urinary source. The patient has been treated with IV fluids, antibiotics (switched from Vancomycin to Nafcillin), and blood transfusion. She is currently hemodynamically stable without any pressor requirements.

The patient also has acute renal failure likely due to ATN in the setting of hypotension/sepsis. Her urine output has been low despite fluid boluses, and her creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.5. She has received maintenance IV fluids, boluses, and a blood transfusion. The goal is to maintain her fluid balance and trend her creatinine levels.

Additionally, the patient has hypertension, which is being managed by holding antihypertensive medications in the acute setting.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Infection: The patient has septic shock due to suspected psoriasis flare with superinfection. There is also a possibility of other infections such as urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Klebsiella. The patient is being treated with appropriate antibiotics, and regular monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any signs of worsening infection.
