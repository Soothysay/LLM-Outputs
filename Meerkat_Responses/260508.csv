","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and systolic congestive heart failure. He presents with dyspnea on exertion for 3 days and is experiencing increased lower extremity edema and non-compliance with lasix, which suggests an acute systolic CHF episode. The patient was transferred from the emergency department on a venti mask. There are no symptoms, fever, or elevated white count to suggest pneumonia. The trigger for the acute CHF is most likely medication non-compliance, as there are no EKG changes to suggest acute coronary syndrome and the patient denies an increase in salt intake. The patient was previously taking 60 mg of lasix orally twice a day at home.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) episode: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, increased lower extremity edema, and non-compliance with lasix indicate an acute systolic CHF episode. It is important to manage the patient's fluid balance, restrict sodium intake, and administer diuretics to reduce fluid overload.

2. Bradycardia: The patient has a heart rate of 40 bpm, which is below the normal range. This could be due to the use of metoprolol, a beta-blocker that can cause bradycardia. The dosage of"

Physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, decreased crackles in the bases of the lungs, and 1+ bilateral edema. The patient's labs show elevated creatinine levels and hyaline casts in the urine, indicating possible acute renal failure. 

The patient's medications include furosemide (Lasix), metoprolol, aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, and other medications as per the assessment and plan section. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of CHF symptoms, further deterioration of renal function, potential bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants, and possible infection given the patient's immune compromised state. 

Further management should focus on optimizing the patient's heart failure treatment, monitoring renal function closely, and adjusting medications accordingly."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with a history of systolic dysfunction who presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation in the context of medical non-compliance. The patient was given another dose of 60IV lasix at 3pm to continue diuresing to goal negative 1-2L. Potassium was repleted at 10pm. The patient experienced one episode of hypoglycemia this morning with a blood sugar level of 54.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is currently receiving infusions and other ICU medications, including Furosemide (Lasix). Other medications include those for coronary artery disease, systolic CHF, atrial fibrillation, depression, glaucoma, and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flow sheet data as of 10/16/2193 shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and other relevant information.

The patient's physical examination reveals general breathing comfortably on nasal cannula 3L with oxygen saturation at 95%. The HEENT examination shows no abnormalities, while the cardiac examination shows regular rhythm rate with no murmurs. Lung sounds are improved, with decreased crackles in the bases. There is evidence of 1+ bilateral edema to the mid-calf.

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of systolic dysfunction who presented with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation due to medical non-compliance. The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Vital signs: Blood pressure is within normal limits with a reading of 126/47 mmHg, heart rate is 43 bpm, respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% on a nasal cannula.
- Physical examination: The patient has bilateral calf edema and decreased breath sounds at the bases, indicating possible fluid overload.
- Labs: The patient has elevated BUN, creatinine, and potassium levels, as well as low sodium and hemoglobin levels. The urine analysis shows mild proteinuria.
- Medications: The patient is currently receiving lasix IV, metoprolol, ASA, and other medications for his various conditions including CHF, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

1. Worsening CHF: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and bilateral calf edema suggest ongoing fluid overload, which can lead to further exacerbation of CHF.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels, along with the presence of hyaline casts in the urine, indicate possible acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function is essential.
