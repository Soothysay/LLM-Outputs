   Assessment and Plan
   78 M with bipolar, a-flutter/fib, T2DM who presents s/p syncopal
   episode with bradycardia and hypotension.
   SYNCOPE/HYPOTENSION - Patient is unclear on what medications he is on,
   but reports taking diltiazem in spite of having been told to stop
   this.  He also reports feeling weak and lightheaded since discharge.
   Most likely etiology of his bradycardia and syncope is nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**]
   overdose.  Other possibilities include vasovagal episode or
   hypoglycemia (although admission FS was 461), arrhythmia, and
   dehydration.  Seizure unlikely given story and cardiac medications.
   Ischemia unlikely, especially with negative enzymes.  Currently on
   dopamine gtt.
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated.  Goal MAP > 65, HR > 50
   - Hold beta-blocker and CCB while bradycardic
   - Orthostatic vitals
   - PT consult
   - Monitor on telemetry
   ATRIAL FLUTTER - Patient was newly diagnosed with A-Fib/flutter on last
   admission ([**11-2**]).  He was being anticoagulated with plan for ablation 3
   weeks post discharge.  Another possibility is TEE/ablation, although
   reportedly TEE probe could not be passed.
   - Rate control with metoprolol as needed, will hold for now given
   dopamine requirement
   - Plan for ablation, will decide on date.
   - continue coumadin
   - barium swallow to evaluation for possible esophageal pathology
   (during last admission, could not pass TEE probe)
   PUMP - No evidence of CHF on recent echo.  Has trace crackles on exam
   and chronic appearing lower extremity edema.  S/P 3L IVF at [**Hospital 1097**]
   hosp.
   - Watch O2 requirement
   - consider CXR
   BIPOLAR DISORDER - Patient on Geodon as outpatient. Concern that may be
   contributing to his bradycardia (known side effect of the medication).
   Will continue to hold for now.
   - consider psych c/s in AM
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE - Creatinine on discharge of 1.4, now
   2.6.  Likely related to decreased perfusion in setting of hypotension.
   Also may represent dehydration or ACEI overdose.  Did not improve with
   3L of IVF at [**Hospital1 1097**].
   - urine lytes and UA
   - consider renal ultrasound if not improving
   DIABETES TYPE 2:
   -Neurotin for neuropathy
   -HISS
   BPH - Hold terazosin given hypotension
   GOUT - Continue allopurinol
   .
   HYPERKALEMIA - resolved at OSH.  [**Month (only) 11**] reflect renal dysfunction, but

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a medical history of bipolar disorder, atrial flutter/fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and several other comorbidities. He presented to the hospital with a syncopal episode accompanied by bradycardia and hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 95/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is atrial flutter, and he has pitting edema to his ankles.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine level from 1.4 on discharge to 2.6, and other abnormalities in electrolyte levels.

The patient's conditions and potential complications include:

1. Syncope/Hypotension: The patient reports weakness and lightheadedness since discharge, which may be related to medication overdose or other etiologies such as vasovagal episode, hypoglycemia, arrhythmia, or dehydration. The most likely cause is nodal [Doctor Last Name 23] overdose.

2. Atrial Flutter: The patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation/flutter during his last admission. He was being anticoagulated"

","The patient is an elderly male with a history of bipolar disorder, atrial flutter/fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure. He presents with a syncopal episode and bradycardia, which may be related to nodal overdose. Other possible etiologies include vasovagal episode, hypoglycemia, arrhythmia, and dehydration.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial flutter and was being anticoagulated for ablation. Rate control with metoprolol is planned, and ablation is scheduled this week. The patient is also on Geodon for bipolar disorder, which may contribute to his bradycardia.

There are no signs of congestive heart failure, but the patient has trace crackles on examination and chronic lower extremity edema. O2 requirement is mild, and an outside chest X-ray shows volume overload.

The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.4 on discharge to 2.6, likely due to decreased perfusion in the setting of hypotension. This could also be related to dehydration or ACEI overdose. Urine lytes and UA are ordered, and renal ultrasound may be considered if there is no improvement.

The patient has type 2 diabetes and requires medication for neuropathy and HbA1c control. He also has benign prostatic hyperplasia, gout, and hyperkalemia, which has resolved at OSH.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 M with bipolar, a-flutter/fib, T2DM who presents s/p syncopal
   episode with bradycardia and hypotension.
   SYNCOPE/HYPOTENSION
 Secondary to AV node blockade by incorrect med
   regimen for Aflutter.
   - Currently off dopamine gtt.
   - Started BB slowly but did not respond until got 25 + 12 +25 of
   Metoprolol. Will change standing dose to 50mg [**Hospital1 **]>
   -  TEE neg for vegetations, plan to ablate once INR low enough. NPO
   today and d/w EP.
   ATRIAL FLUTTER - Patient was newly diagnosed with A-Fib/flutter on last
   admission ([**11-2**]).  He was being anticoagulated with plan for ablation 3
   weeks post discharge.  Another possibility is TEE/ablation, although
   reportedly TEE probe could not be passed.
   - Barium swallow and TEE normal, plan for ablation once INR low enough.
   - BB for rate control as needed.
   - Coumadin held, Heparin started for ablation
   - barium swallow to evaluation for possible esophageal pathology
   (during last admission, could not pass TEE probe)
   PUMP
 S/P 3L IVF at OSH, now very negative after 2 doses of IV Lasix
   40mg.  Cr stable so seems to have tolerated well.
   BIPOLAR DISORDER -  Restarted Geodon as etiology of bradycardia is
   likely AV node blockade.
   - Received PM dose and tolerated well.
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE - Creatinine baseline 1.4, peaked at
   2.6, now 2.1.  Has not improved in last 24 hrs, ? because
   overdiuresing. Would favor allowing pt to balance himself out.
   DIABETES TYPE 2:
   -Neurotin for neuropathy
   -HISS
   BPH - Hold terazosin given hypotension
   GOUT - Continue allopurinol  at lower dose given renal failure

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of bipolar disorder, atrial flutter/fibrillation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents with a syncopal episode characterized by bradycardia and hypotension, believed to be secondary to AV node blockade with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. The patient has been started on heparin and is off coumadin. He required multiple doses of metoprolol for any effect on heart rate. The patient responded dramatically to IV lasix 40mg in the morning. The patient's allergies include ciprofloxacin, sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), penicillins, and nut flavor. His last dose of antibiotics was on [date]. He is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and other medications in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with multiple comorbidities, including atrial flutter, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with shortness of breath and was found to have pulmonary edema. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and crackles on lung examination suggest pulmonary edema. If not managed appropriately, this condition can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is already experiencing atrial flutter, which is an abnormal heart rhythm. It is important to monitor and manage his heart rhythm to prevent further complications such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. If not treated, this can lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest worsening renal function. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further decline in renal function.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating thrombocytopenia. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia. Proper management is necessary to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
