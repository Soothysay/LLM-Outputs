   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 84 yoF w/ a h/o CAD, diastolic CHF, DMII, PVD
   presented initially with cholangitis to an OSH on [**7-28**]- transferred to
   [**Hospital1 5**] and underwent ERCP on [**8-1**]- post ERCP developed fever, rigors and
   tachycardia.
   # Cholangitis: Rigors likely related to cholangiogram and transient
   sepsis.  OSH blood culture grew E. coli sensitive to cefazolin,
   ampicillin and piperacillin
   - discontinue  vanc
   - continue cipro until our cultures are back
   - switch meropenem to zosyn
    -repeat Blood culture
   - repeat WBC with differentials
   # Hypxoia: likely related to Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF given
   rales. 99% on 2L O2.
   -  try to wean off NC O2 while checking O2 sats.
   -  diurese gently today with a goal of negative 30cc/hr. Check Cr
   tomorrow.
   -  follow abgs and resp status closely
   # Acute renal failure: Cr 1.1, on [**8-1**] had been 1.3.  Most likely due
   to pre-renal cause due to Cr decrease after fluid bolus and FENa of
   0.6.
   - repeat creatinine
   - follow urine output
   # DMII:
   - on insulin sliding scale, at home is on glipizide, hold glipizide
   while inpatient
   # Delerium: improving quickly, likely related to fever, propofol,
   demerol, post procedure, bacteremia.
   # Hypertension: hold antihypertensives for now as actively infected,
   restart when pt stable or if becomes hypertensive.
   - wean Levaphed with MAP goal of 65
   # CAD: severe angina and 3VD, on asa / plavix for subclavian stenosis
   (L side, feeding LIMA)
   -hold beta blocker and antihypertensives as above, restart low dose
   beta blocker if BP >140 and HR >100.
   -continue ASA 81mg daily
   -restart plavix.  cards had been consulted regarding plavix, f/u cards
   recs (last intervention [**12-9**]- coronary stent- bare metal)
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   -continue zetia
   -hold simvastatin until LFTs return to normal
   # Depression / Dementia: continue celexa, remeron and abilify (home
   meds), hold ativan.

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented initially with cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on [**8-1**]. Post-procedure, she developed fever, rigors, and tachycardia.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management. These include:

1. Cholangitis: Rigors likely related to the cholangiogram and transient sepsis. The blood culture grew E. coli sensitive to cefazolin, ampicillin, and piperacillin. It is recommended to discontinue vancomycin and continue ciprofloxacin until the cultures are back. Switch meropenem to Zosyn and repeat blood culture.

2. Hypoxia: Likely related to acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure given rales. The patient is on 2 liters of oxygen and is maintaining an O2 saturation of 99%. It is advised to try weaning off the nasal cannula while monitoring oxygen saturation.

3. Acute renal failure: Creatinine is elevated at 1.1, compared to 1.3 on [**8-1**]. This could be due to a pre-renal cause, possibly from fluid resuscitation. Repeat creatinine and follow urine output"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

- The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and subsequently developed fever, rigors, and tachycardia.
- The patient was admitted for close observation and started on multi-lumen and arterial lines.
- Blood cultures were taken, and the patient was found to have an infection with E. coli, which is sensitive to ampicillin, cefazolin, and piperacillin.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), heart failure (CHF), and cholangitis.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes.
- The patient is experiencing hypoxia, likely related to acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF.
- The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.3, which is higher than the previous level of 1.1.
- The patient is on insulin sliding scale and has been advised to hold glipizide, their home medication for DMII.
- The patient is improving from delirium but still requires propofol and demerol.
- The patient has hypertension, and antihypertensive medications have been withheld due to active infection.
- The patient has a history of severe angina and triple vessel disease (3VD) and is on ASA and Plavix for subclavian"

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and cholangitis. She presented initially with cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on [date]. Post-ERCP, she developed fever, rigors, and tachycardia. She was admitted for close observation.

Key findings from the progress note include:
1. Fever - 101.3°F
2. Low urinary output at 10 PM (20cc/hour)
3. Hypotension
4. Increased cardiac enzymes (CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 142/3/0.03)
5. Abnormal lung sounds (crackles heard lower on left, lower [12-4] on right)
6. Abdominal distension
7. Elevated blood glucose level (162 mg/dL)
8. Elevated white blood cell count (19.8 K/uL)
9. Positive blood culture for E. coli, sensitive to ampicillin, cefazolin, and piperacillin
10. Urine analysis showing 30+ protein, negative nitrates, ketone, bilirubin, pH 5.5, and 14 RBC/HPF

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and positive blood culture indicate possible sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's low urinary output, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal urine analysis suggest the possibility of AKI, which can be caused by sepsis, dehydration, or medications.
3. Pulmonary edema: The presence of crackles on lung auscultation and the patient's history of CHF may indicate pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory distress.
4. Cholangitis: The patient initially presented with cholangitis, an infection of the bile ducts. This condition can worsen if not treated appropriately.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The elevated blood glucose level and ketone presence in the urine raise concern for DKA, a serious complication of diabetes mellitus.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization due to illness increases the risk of developing DVT, a potentially life-threatening blood clot in the legs.

Based on the information provided, the patient's current medical conditions include cholangitis, sepsis without organ dysfunction, diastolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and acute renal failure. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, diuretics, insulin, and other supportive measures. Close monitoring and prompt management of potential complications are crucial for the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure. She was admitted with cholangitis and presented with sepsis following an ERCP procedure. She is experiencing tachycardia, hypotension, fever, and has rigors, desaturation, and tachycardia after the procedure. She was started on multi-lumen and arterial lines, blood cultures were taken, and she was given broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her condition improved with IV fluids, titration of levophed, and improved urine output. She has a history of allergies to eggs. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 120/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presentation of sepsis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of tachycardia, hypotension, fever, and positive blood cultures suggests sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention.
2. Cholangitis: The patient's history of cholangitis and recent ERCP procedure may have contributed to the development of sepsis. Cholangitis is a serious infection of the bile ducts that"

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure. She presented with cholangitis and subsequently developed sepsis after undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient's current medical complications include sepsis, hypotension, cholangitis, E. coli bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypoxia, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF) that has resolved, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, fever, and decreased oxygen saturation. Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and the antibiotic regimen has been adjusted based on the sensitivity of the isolated E. coli. She is receiving IV fluids, norepinephrine, and has an arterial line for continuous monitoring of blood pressure. The plan is to continue with IV fluids, wean off levophed, monitor urine output, central venous pressure (CVP), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2). The patient is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and will resume Plavix due to the presence of a stent.

Overall, the patient remains critically"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented initially with cholangitis and was transferred to the hospital, where she underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on [8-1]. Post-ERCP, she developed fever, rigors, and tachycardia.

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Cholangitis: The patient likely has cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. This is suggested by her symptoms of fever, rigors, and tachycardia after the ERCP procedure. The OSH blood culture grew E. coli, which is sensitive to antibiotics such as cefazolin, ampicillin, and piperacillin. Therefore, the plan is to restart vancomycin, continue ciprofloxacin, and zosyn until the cultures are back. Follow-up with blood cultures, repeat WBC with differentials, repeat urine culture, and consider RUQ ultrasound.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia likely related to acute on chronic diastolic CHF. Rales are heard on lung auscultation. The goal is to wean off nasal cannula oxygen while checking O2 sats. Diurese gently today with a goal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, presented initially with cholangitis. She underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on [**8-1**] and subsequently developed fever, rigors, and tachycardia. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Cholangitis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis as a result of the cholangiogram during the ERCP. The blood culture from the outside hospital grew E. coli, which is sensitive to cefazolin, ampicillin, and piperacillin. It is recommended to discontinue vancomycin and continue ciprofloxacin until the cultures are back. Switch meropenem to Zosyn and repeat blood culture.
- Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia likely related to acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. There are rales present on lung auscultation. The patient is on 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula and her O2 saturation is 99%. It is advised to wean off the nasal cannula oxygen while monitoring the oxygen saturation levels.
- Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has decreased from 1.3 on [**8-1**] to 1.1. This is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure. She was admitted with cholangitis and developed sepsis post ERCP. The patient has been experiencing recurrent fever and hypotension, along with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It is crucial to manage this promptly to prevent further deterioration.

2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension indicates inadequate blood flow to vital organs. It is essential to maintain adequate blood pressure to ensure organ perfusion and prevent multi-organ failure.

3. Cholangitis: The patient's symptoms of fever and RUQ pain suggest ongoing biliary process despite improvement in liver function tests (LFTs). Continuous monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to address this issue.

4. E. coli bacteremia: The presence of E. coli bacteria in the blood indicates a bacterial infection. Antibiotic therapy should be tailored to target this specific organism to effectively treat the infection.

5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's leukocytosis and recurrent fever may also be indicative of a UTI. Adequate urine output and urinary catheter care should be maintained to minimize the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented initially with cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on [8-1]. Post-ERCP, she developed fever, rigors, and tachycardia.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including cholangitis, hypoxia, right-sided pain (musculoskeletal vs. atelectasis), acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, delirium, hypotension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, depression/dementia, and gallbladder sludge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient initially presented with cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. She underwent ERCP, but subsequently developed fever, rigors, and tachycardia, suggesting a possible recurrence of infection. The blood culture grew E. coli sensitive to cefazolin, ampicillin, and piperacillin, so restarting vancomycin is recommended.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, likely related to acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure given the presence of rales. Oxygen saturation is 99% on 2L O2. Weaning off nasal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented initially with cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on [8-1]. Post-ERCP, she developed fever, rigors, and tachycardia.

Medical Complications:

1. Cholangitis: Rigors likely related to cholangiogram and transient sepsis.
   - Restart vancomycin.
   - Continue ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam until cultures are back.
   - Follow-up with blood cultures.
   - Repeat WBC with differentials.
   - Repeat urine culture.
   - Consider RUQ u/s. Follow-up with GI recommendations.

2. Hypoxia: Likely related to acute on chronic diastolic CHF given rales.
   - Try to wean off nasal cannula oxygen while checking oxygen saturation.
   - Diurese gently today with a goal of negative 30cc/hr. Check creatinine tomorrow.
   - Follow ABGs and respiratory status closely.

3. Right-sided pain: Musculoskeletal vs. atelectasis.
   - Not tachycardic or tachypneic, therefore less suggestive of pulmonary embolism.
   - Continue incentive spirometry.
   - Trend WBC.

4. Acute renal failure: Creatinine 1.0, currently stable.
   - Repeat creatinine.
   - Follow urine output.

5. Diabetes mellitus type II:
   - On insulin sliding scale, at home is on glipizide, hold glipizide while inpatient.

6. Delirium: Improving quickly, likely related to fever, propofol, demerol, post-procedure, bacteremia.

7. Hypotension: Currently weaned off Levophed. Restart with goal of mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65.
   - Continue monitoring blood pressure.

8. Coronary artery disease: Severe angina and triple vessel disease, on aspirin and Plavix for subclavian stenosis (left side, feeding left internal mammary artery).
   - Hold beta-blocker and antihypertensives as above, restart low-dose beta-blocker if blood pressure >140 and heart rate >100.
   - Continue ASA 81mg daily.
   - Plavix added back to regimen. Cardiology consulted regarding Plavix, follow-up cardiology recommendations (last intervention [12-9]- coronary stent - bare metal).

9. Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue zetia.
   - Hold simvastatin until liver function tests return to normal.

10. Depression/Dementia: Continue citalopram, mirtazapine, and a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, cholangitis, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic diastolic heart failure, and a history of coronary artery disease.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range (36.5 C or 97.7 F), but their blood pressure is slightly low (119/59 mmHg). The heart rate is stable at 62 bpm, respiratory rate is within normal limits (18 inspirations per minute), and oxygen saturation is good at 99%. The patient's weight has decreased from 82.2 kg to 79.9 kg since admission.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,510 mL and output of 1,515 mL since midnight, indicating a slight negative fluid balance. The central venous pressure (CVP) is currently at 5 mmHg, which is within the normal range (2-10 mmHg). The patient is receiving intravenous fluids and has been given a total of 632 mL of fluids since midnight.

The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently elevated, ranging from 146 to 209 mg/dL. Their white blood cell count has fluctuated between 14.8 and 19.8 thousand cells/mm3. The creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.3 mg/dL, indicating some kidney dysfunction."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She presented initially with cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure. Post-ERCP, she developed fever, rigors, and tachycardia.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Cholangitis: Rigors likely related to cholangiogram and transient sepsis. Blood culture grew E. coli sensitive to cefazolin, ampicillin, and piperacillin. Ultrasound showed no evidence of cholangitis.
   - Restart vancomycin (likely to discontinue tomorrow)
   - Discontinue ciprofloxacin and Zosyn today
   - Follow up with blood cultures
   - Repeat white blood cell count with differentials
   - Repeat urine culture
   - Follow up with gastroenterology recommendations

2. Hypoxia: Likely related to acute on chronic diastolic CHF given rales. Oxygen saturation is 99% on 2 liters of oxygen.
   - Try to wean off nasal cannula oxygen while checking oxygen saturation.
   - Diurese gently today with a goal of negative 30cc/hr. Follow up with creatinine"

   FINDINGS: Liver shows no focal or textural abnormalities. There is
   pneumobilia seen in the left lobe of the liver, presumably related to
   recent
   ERCP procedure. Biliary stent is visualized in place within the common
   bile
   duct. Stent patency cannot be assessed by ultrasound. There is no
   biliary
   ductal dilatation.
   The gallbladder is not distended, but contains a moderate amount of
   echogenic
   material most consistent with sludge, possibly some confluent balls of
   sludge.
   There is no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.
   Son[**Name (NI) 1976**]

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic heart failure. She was admitted with cholangitis and developed sepsis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient continues to experience recurrent fever and hypotension along with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 57 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 9 mmHg.

The patient has received various antibiotics including meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. She also receives prophylactic heparin sodium for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.8, elevated troponin T levels, and improved renal function compared to previous values. Imaging studies reveal sludge in the common bile duct without any acute process, and chest X-ray shows left lower lobe"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure. She was admitted with cholangitis and developed sepsis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient's current issues include sepsis, hypotension, cholangitis, E. coli bacteremia, hypoxia, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury (resolved), and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs, potentially causing organ damage.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis needs to be managed appropriately to prevent further complications such as liver abscess formation or persistent infection.
4. E. coli bacteremia: The presence of E. coli in the bloodstream increases the risk of septicemia and related complications.
5. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation may indicate inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues, potentially leading to tissue damage.
6. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
7. ARF (Acute Kidney Injury): Although resolved, the patient's recent kidney"

   # Cholangitis: Rigors likely related to cholangiogram and transient
   sepsis.  OSH blood culture grew E. coli sensitive to cefazolin,
   ampicillin and piperacillin. U/S showed no evidence of cholangitis.
   - discontinue abx

   -  diurese gently today with a goal of negative 30cc/hr. F/u Cr levels
   -  monitor resp status closely
   # Right sided pain: musculoskeletal vs. pleuritic (atelectasis/
   inflammation)
   -not tachycardic or tachypnea, therefore less suggestive of PE
   -continue incentive spirometry
   -trend WBC and continue current abx regimen
   # DMII:
   - on insulin sliding scale, at home is on glipizide, hold glipizide
   while inpatient
   # Hypotension: currently weaned off NE.  Restart with goal of MAP>65.
   - continue monitoring BP and patient
s symptoms during episodes of
   hypotension.
   # CAD: severe angina and 3VD, on asa / plavix for subclavian stenosis
   (L side, feeding LIMA)
   -hold beta blocker and antihypertensives as above, restart low dose
   beta blocker if BP >160 and HR >100.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The patient presented initially with cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) on [8-1]. Post-ERCP, she developed fever, rigors, and tachycardia. 

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Cholangitis: Rigors likely related to cholangiogram and transient sepsis. The patient's blood culture grew E. coli sensitive to cefazolin, ampicillin, and piperacillin. Ultrasonography showed no evidence of cholangitis.
   - Discontinue antibiotics
   - Follow up with blood cultures
   - Repeat white blood cell count with differentials
   - ERCP in 6 weeks

2. Hypoxia: likely related to acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF given rales. The patient is currently on 2 liters of oxygen and has an oxygen saturation of 100%.
   - Try to wean off nasal cannula oxygen while checking oxygen saturation levels
   - Diurese gently today with a goal of negative 30cc/hr. Follow up with creatinine levels
   - Monitor respiratory status closely

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions including sepsis without organ dysfunction, cholangitis, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic diastolic heart failure, and a history of coronary artery disease. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/62 mmHg to 94/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 79.9 kg, which is slightly lower than their admission weight of 82.2 kg.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,201 mL and output of 1,860 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -659 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivered through a nasal cannula, and their ABG results show normal oxygenation and ventilation parameters.

The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and their skin, neurologic status, and other physical examination findings are also not assessed. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but kidney function may be slightly impaired with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL.

The patient's glucose levels are elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Cardiac markers"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and possibly cholangiocarcinoma. She was admitted with cholangitis and presented with sepsis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient's condition has been improving, with resolution of sepsis, hypotension, and acute kidney injury. However, she still has leukocytosis, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and ongoing intermittent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis, an infection of the bile ducts. If left untreated, it can progress to severe complications such as liver abscess, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has an E. coli bacteremia, indicating the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis and potentially cause infections in other organs.
4. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing new-onset diarrhea, which may be caused by Clostridium difficile infection or other gastrointestinal issues. Diarrhea can result in fluid loss and electrolyte"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart failure. She was admitted with cholangitis and developed sepsis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. She is currently off pressors and showing improvement in her infection parameters. Her leukocytosis and liver function tests are trending down. The patient's chest x-ray shows improved aeration and positioning of the inferior vena cava (IJ) filter. A culture from the bile duct grew E. coli, which is being treated with Zosyn. The plan is to continue the antibiotic therapy for a total of 14 days and possibly switch to ampicillin-sulbactam (Unasyn) tomorrow. The patient's intermittent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is suspected to be pleurisy or inflammation, and a repeat ERCP is planned in several weeks. The patient's other conditions, such as acute kidney injury (resolved), diabetes mellitus type 2, and congestive heart failure, are also being managed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis and now returns to the ICU with rigors, hypotension, and fever.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are as follows:

1. Perforated gallbladder: The patient has a contained gallbladder perforation into the right lobe of the liver. This condition can lead to infection, abscess formation, or further spread of the infection.

2. E. Coli sepsis: The patient has an ongoing E. Coli infection, which can result in septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and potentially death if not properly managed.

3. Cholangitis: The patient initially presented with cholangitis due to stent migration. This condition can cause fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain. If left untreated, it can lead to sepsis and liver dysfunction.

4. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, which increases the risk of hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and diastolic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient is experiencing fever, rigors, and hypotension, which are consistent with developing sepsis. The possible causes include perforated gallbladder, Clostridium difficile infection (given diarrhea and recent antibiotic use), urinary tract infection, or infection related to indwelling lines. The patient was previously on ciprofloxacin and flagyl, so ciprofloxacin was discontinued, and vancomycin and zosyn were started, along with continued flagyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, rigors, and hypotension suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Perforated gallbladder: The patient has a perforated loculated gallbladder, which can lead to infection and abscess formation.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has diarrhea and leukocytosis, which may indicate a C. difficile infection, especially considering recent antibiotic use.

Coli sepsis. The patient has been in the intensive care unit (ICU) with rigors, hypotension, and fever.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are:

1. Chest pain: The patient experienced chest heaviness with T-wave inversions/ST depressions in leads V2-V5 around 9AM this morning. This could indicate ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction. The patient was given SL nitro and MSIR 7.5mg PRN for pain relief. 

2. Fever and rigors: These symptoms are likely secondary to a perforated gallbladder, which has been confirmed by imaging. The underlying cause of the perforation is unclear. Surgery, ERCP, and interventional radiology (IR) have been involved in the patient's care. However, the patient and her daughter have declined further IR drainage or surgery. C. difficile (C. diff) testing has been negative twice.

3. Troponin leak: The patient has a troponin leak, which suggests myocardial injury. This may be related to the infectious process, known coronary artery"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 84 year old female with history of coronary artery
   disease, diastolic CHF, DMII, PVD who presented with cholangitis
   secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis, returns to the
   intensive care unit with rigors, hypotension, and fever.
   .
   #Chest pain: History of chest heaviness resolved within a minute with
   SL nitro.  Patient states she has experienced this type of pain
   before.  No further episodes since yesterday AM.
   - maintain ASA dose at 325
   - SL nitro PRN
   - MSIR 7.5mg PRN
   - cont metoprolol 12.5mg
   .
   # Fever, rigors:  Most likely secondary to perforated gallbladder,
   contained.  Underlying etiology of perforation unclear.  Surgery, ERCP,
   and IR have been following. Patient and daughter would not like to
   pursue any further IR drainage or surgery.  C. diff negative times two.
   Contact[**Name (NI) **] ERCP team about patient's change in status
 report no
   migration of the stent on CT.  Patient does not feel she would want to
   undergo repeat ERCP. Patient reported to team during rounds she does
   not wish to re-start pressors.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn
   - increase vanc dose to 1250mg q24h
   - c/s ID for outpatient abx regimen
   - d/c cvl; maintain PICC line
   - follow up exisiting cultures
   - continue pain control with percoset PRN
   .
   # Hypxoia: Mild hypoxia likly related to some degree of acute on
   chronic diastolic CHF given rales.
   - Fluid boluses as needed to support BP and UOP, though will have to be
   very mindful of respiratory status given DNI status.
   .
   # Troponin leak: Suspect likely to demand in setting of mild
   tachycardia with infectious process with known CAD with severe angina
   and 3VD, on asa / plavix for subclavian stenosis (L side, feeding
   LIMA). Currently HR is much improved.
   - Continue ASA, plavix
   - Cardiology had been following, will re-consult if needed.
   .
   # DMII:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale, at home is on glipizide, hold
   glipizide while inpatient
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue zetia and simvastatin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient experienced chest pain described as heaviness in the torso, chest, and arms, accompanied by significant ischemia on an EKG. Nitroglycerin (NTG) 0.4 tablet sublingually and 2mg intravenous morphine were given, resulting in good effect. Lopressor 12.5mg orally twice daily was also started. Several EKGs were performed, and cardiac enzymes were sent for analysis.

The patient declined invasive management (IR drainage) and preferred comfort care. Morphine was discontinued, and the patient felt that Percocet worked better for her pain management.

The patient has allergies to eggs and an unknown allergy. She received various antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and heparin sodium as prophylaxis.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 138/53mmHg to 153/"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 84 year old female with history of coronary artery
   disease, diastolic CHF, DMII, PVD who presented with cholangitis
   secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis, returns to the
   intensive care unit with rigors, hypotension, and fever.
   .
   #Chest pain: chest heaviness resolved within a minute with SL nitro.
   Patient states she has experienced this type of pain before.
   - increase ASA dose to 325
   - SL nitro PRN
   - MSIR 7.5mg PRN
   - place back on O2 NC
   - add metoprolol 25mg
   - repeat CEs
   .
   # Fever, rigors:  Most likely secondary to perforated gallbladder,
   contained.  Underlying etiology of perforation unclear.  Surgery, ERCP,
   and IR have been following. Patient and daughter would not like to
   pursue any further IR drainage or surgery.  C. diff negative times two.
   - d/c flagyl
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/zosyn
   - vanc trough in the AM
   - follow up exisiting cultures
   - Contact[**Name (NI) **] ERCP team about patient's change in status
 report no
   migration of the stent on CT.  Patient does not feel she would want to
   undergo repeat ERCP
   - lactate WNL, follow urine output, CVP (currently 7), small IVF bolus
   (LR) for MAP <65. Patient reported to team during rounds she does not
   wish to re-start pressors.
   - continue pain control with percoset PRN
   .
   # Hypxoia: Mild hypoxia likly related to some degree of acute on
   chronic diastolic CHF given rales.
   - Fluid boluses as needed to support BP and UOP, though will have to be
   very mindful of respiratory status given DNI status.
   .
   # Troponin leak: Suspect likely to demand in setting of mild
   tachycardia with infectious process with known CAD with severe angina
   and 3VD, on asa / plavix for subclavian stenosis (L side, feeding
   LIMA). Currently HR is much improved.
   - Continue ASA, plavix
   - Work to reverse processes, optimize fluid status, etc.
   - repeat CE in light of episode this morning
   - Cardiology had been following, will re-consult if needed.
   .
   # DMII:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale, at home is on glipizide, hold
   glipizide while inpatient

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic CHF, DMII, PVD. She presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis and is currently in the ICU. The patient experienced chest pain described as heaviness in the torso, chest, and arms, which resolved within a minute after receiving SL nitro. This type of pain has been experienced before by the patient. The patient's fever and rigors are likely secondary to a perforated gallbladder, but it appears to be contained. There is uncertainty regarding the underlying etiology of the perforation. The patient and her daughter do not wish to pursue further IR drainage or surgery, and C. diff has been negative twice. The patient's troponin levels are mildly elevated, suggesting possible ischemia. The patient's hypoxia is likely related to acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF given the presence of rales. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and fluid boluses may be necessary to support blood pressure and urine output. Pain control should be continued with Percocet as needed. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, as discussed with the patient and family."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic CHF, DMII, PVD who presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis. The patient returned to the ICU with rigors, hypotension, and fever. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Chest pain: The patient experienced heaviness in the torso and chest and arms, which resolved within a minute with SL nitro. This type of pain may be indicative of ischemic heart disease or angina.
2. Fever and rigors: These symptoms are likely secondary to perforated gallbladder, contained. The underlying etiology of perforation is unclear, but it could be due to gallstones or another cause.
3. Troponin leak: The patient has a history of CAD with severe angina and 3VD. The mild tachycardia with infectious process may have caused a troponin leak. The patient's known CAD increases the risk of myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
4. Hypoxia: Mild hypoxia is likely related to some degree of acute on chronic diastolic CHF given rales. This can worsen if fluid overload occurs.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with cholecystitis and a contained gallbladder rupture, as well as urosepsis. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, chronic diastolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, cholangitis, and constipation. 

On 08/08/2185, the patient experienced chest pain and an EKG showed significant ischemia. Nitroglycerin and morphine were given with good effect. Lopressor was started at 12.5mg PO BID. Several EKGs were done, and enzymes were sent.

The patient had a family meeting over the weekend where it was decided that conservative medical management would be pursued, with the patient refusing any procedures. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 127/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue and pain, which she reports as comfortable. 

Physical examination findings include thin appearance, normocephalic head, normal lymph nodes, normal cardiovascular examination, no lower extremity edema, and crackles in the chest. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other labs are within normal limits. 

The patient's assessment includes sepsis without organ dysfunction, cholangitis with a contained gallbladder rupture, type II diabetes mellitus, constipation, chronic diastolic heart failure, and a history of coronary artery disease. 

The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics (zosyn/vancomycin) and increasing the dose of vancomycin while following levels. The patient is on pain management and will continue rissole. Metoprolol has been added due to an episode of chest pain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and history of urosepsis indicate an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis. Prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics is essential.
2. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient currently does not have organ dysfunction, her condition can worsen if the infection progresses.
3. Gallbladder rupture: The contained gallbladder rupture needs to be closely monitored for any signs of worsening or perforation.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent episode of chest pain suggest a risk for cardiac complications. Continuous monitoring of cardiac enzymes and regular assessment of chest pain are necessary.
5. Diabetic complications: The patient's type II diabetes mellitus requires careful management of blood glucose levels to prevent diabetic complications such as ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.
6. Constipation: The patient's constipation should be managed to prevent complications such as bowel obstruction or impaction."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, presenting with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with rigors, hypotension, and fever. The patient's current condition is stable with controlled vital signs and improving tachycardia. She has a history of chest heaviness that resolved within a minute with sublingual nitroglycerin, which she has experienced before. The patient's fever and rigors are likely secondary to a perforated gallbladder, with an unclear underlying etiology. She does not wish to pursue further interventional radiology (IR) drainage or surgery, and her C. difficile test is negative. The patient's hypoxia is likely related to acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF with rales. There is a suspicion of troponin leak due to her infectious process and known coronary artery disease with severe angina and triple vessel disease, although her heart rate has improved. The patient's diabetes mellitus type II is being managed with insulin sliding scale, and she is currently on ASA, Plavix, Zetia, and Simvastatin for her medical conditions.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. coli sepsis. The patient returned to the ICU with rigors, hypotension, and fever. She has decided to pursue drainage of a collection through interventional radiology-guided drainage. The patient's current condition includes fever and rigors, likely secondary to a perforated gallbladder, contained. There is also mild hypoxia likely related to acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF given rales. Other issues include chest pain, a troponin leak, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, depression/dementia, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current symptoms of fever and rigors suggest an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis. The presence of E. coli in the blood culture supports this possibility.
2. Organ Failure: Severe infection and sepsis can potentially lead to organ failure, including renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular dysfunction.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's diabetes mellitus type II and poor glycemic control put her at risk for developing DKA, especially if her insulin therapy is inadequate.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease, who presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with rigors, hypotension, and fever.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of E. Coli sepsis and currently presents with rigors, hypotension, and fever, which are signs of possible sepsis. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Perforated gallbladder: The patient's fever, rigors, and hypotension may be secondary to a perforated gallbladder, which can lead to peritonitis and sepsis. Surgical intervention may be required to address this issue.

3. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The patient exhibits mild hypoxia likely related to some degree of acute on chronic diastolic CHF given the presence of rales. Fluid boluses may be necessary to support blood pressure and urine output, but caution should be exercised due to the patient's respiratory status and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. The note indicates that the patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, cholangitis, gallbladder rupture/contained, diabetes mellitus type II, and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Sepsis: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. It can lead to organ failure and death if not promptly treated.
2. Cholangitis: Cholangitis is an infection of the bile ducts, which can cause inflammation, swelling, and blockage. If left untreated, it can lead to liver damage and sepsis.
3. Gallbladder rupture/contained: A ruptured gallbladder can result in the leakage of bile into the abdominal cavity, leading to infection and inflammation. If not managed appropriately, it can progress to severe complications such as peritonitis or sepsis.
4. Diabetes mellitus type II: Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels. If not well-controlled, it can lead to various complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and eye problems.
5. Coronary artery disease (CAD): CAD occurs when the blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart become narrowed or blocked. If not managed properly, it can result in heart"

   culture and gram stain. Small right lateral abdominal wall hematoma.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 84 year old female with history of coronary artery
   disease, diastolic CHF, DMII, PVD who presented with cholangitis
   secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis, returns to the
   intensive care unit with rigors, hypotension, and fever.
   .
   # Fever, rigors:  Most likely secondary to perforated gallbladder,
   contained.  Underlying etiology of perforation unclear.  Surgery, ERCP,
   and IR have been following. Patient is s/p IR drainage.
- continue ceftriaxone 2 grams IV q 24 hours and flagyl 500 mg q 8 h as per ID r
   - follow up exisiting cultures
   - continue pain control with morphine: switch to percoset if pain
   tolerated
   .
   # Hypxoia: Mild hypoxia likly related to some degree of acute on
   chronic diastolic CHF given rales.
   - Fluid boluses as needed to support BP and UOP, though will have to be
   very mindful of respiratory status given DNI status.
   - Continue insp spirometry
   .
   #Chest pain: History of chest heaviness resolved within a minute with
   SL nitro.  Patient states she has experienced this type of pain
   before.  No further episodes since yesterday AM.
   - SL nitro PRN, MSIR 7.5mg PRN, metoprolol 12.5mg
   - decrease ASA to 81mg
   .
   # Troponin leak: Suspect likely to demand in setting of mild
   tachycardia with infectious process with known CAD with severe angina
   and 3VD, on asa / plavix for subclavian stenosis (L side, feeding
   LIMA). Currently HR is much improved.
   - Continue ASA, plavix
   - Cardiology had been following.
   .
   # DMII:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale, at home is on glipizide, hold
   glipizide while inpatient
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue zetia and simvastatin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease. She presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient experienced rigors, hypotension, and fever, indicating a possible perforated gallbladder with contained infection. Surgical, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and interventional radiology (IR) teams have been involved in her care. The patient underwent an IR drainage procedure.

The patient has ongoing fever, rigors, mild hypoxia, and chest pain. Her troponin levels are elevated, suggesting possible cardiac involvement. She has diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, depression/dementia, and is on various medications including insulin, statins, antidepressants, and antipsychotics. She has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis with ranitidine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Perforated gallbladder with contained infection: The patient's symptoms of rigors, hypotension, and fever suggest a perforated gallbladder. If the infection spreads or the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 84 year old female with history of coronary artery
   disease, diastolic CHF, DMII, PVD who presented with cholangitis
   secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis, returns to the
   intensive care unit with rigors, hypotension, and fever.
   .
   # Fever, rigors:  Most likely secondary to perforated gallbladder,
   contained.  Underlying etiology of perforation unclear.  Surgery, ERCP,
   and IR have been following. Patient is s/p IR drainage.
- continue ceftriaxone 2 grams IV q 24 hours and flagyl 500 mg q 8 h as per ID r
   - follow up exisiting cultures
   - continue pain control with morphine: switch to percoset if pain
   tolerated
   .
   # Hypxoia: Mild hypoxia likly related to some degree of acute on
   chronic diastolic CHF given rales.
   - Fluid boluses as needed to support BP and UOP, though will have to be
   very mindful of respiratory status given DNI status.
   - Continue insp spirometry
   .
   #Chest pain: History of chest heaviness resolved within a minute with
   SL nitro.  Patient states she has experienced this type of pain
   before.  No further episodes since yesterday AM.
   - maintain ASA dose at 325, SL nitro PRN, MSIR 7.5mg PRN, metoprolol
   12.5mg
   .
   # Troponin leak: Suspect likely to demand in setting of mild
   tachycardia with infectious process with known CAD with severe angina
   and 3VD, on asa / plavix for subclavian stenosis (L side, feeding
   LIMA). Currently HR is much improved.
   - Continue ASA, plavix

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis and returned to the intensive care unit with rigors, hypotension, and fever.

Medical Complications:

1. Fever and rigors: These symptoms are likely due to a perforated gallbladder, which is contained. The underlying cause of the perforation is unclear. Surgery, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and interventional radiology (IR) have been involved in managing this condition. The patient has undergone an IR drainage procedure.

2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing mild hypoxia, which is likely related to some degree of acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF given the presence of rales. Fluid boluses will be given as needed to support blood pressure and urine output, while being mindful of respiratory status due to the do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status.

3. Chest pain: The patient has a history of chest heaviness that resolved within a minute with sublingual nitroglycerin. This type of pain has occurred before, with no further episodes since yesterday morning. The patient's current medications include aspirin (ASA) at a"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 84 year old female with history of coronary artery
   disease, diastolic CHF, DMII, PVD who presented with cholangitis
   secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis s/p ERCP with
   subsequent contained perforated GB s/p GB drain placed.
   .
   # Fever, rigors:  Most likely secondary to perforated gallbladder,
   contained.  Underlying etiology of perforation unclear.  Surgery, ERCP,
   and IR have been following. Patient is s/p IR drainage.
- continue ceftriaxone 2 grams IV q 24 hours and flagyl 500 mg q 8 h as per ID r
   - follow up existing cultures
   - continue pain control with morphine: switch to percoset if pain
   tolerated
   .
   # Hypoxia: Mild hypoxia likely related to some degree of acute on
   chronic diastolic CHF given rales.
   - Fluid boluses as needed to support BP and UOP, though will have to be
   very mindful of respiratory status given DNI status.
   - Continue insp spirometry
   .
   #Chest pain: History of chest heaviness resolved within a minute with
   SL nitro.  Patient states she has experienced this type of pain
   before.  No further episodes since yesterday AM.
   - SL nitro PRN, MSIR 7.5mg PRN, metoprolol 12.5mg
   - decrease ASA to 81mg
   .
   # Troponin leak: Suspect likely to demand in setting of mild
   tachycardia with infectious process with known CAD with severe angina
   and 3VD, on asa / plavix for subclavian stenosis (L side, feeding
   LIMA). Currently HR is much improved.
   - Continue ASA, plavix
   - Cardiology had been following.
   .
   # DMII:
   - Continue insulin sliding scale, at home is on glipizide, hold
   glipizide while inpatient

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis after undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient also has a contained perforated gallbladder and is scheduled for an intraoperative (IR) drainage procedure.

The patient is currently experiencing fever and rigors, which are likely related to the perforated gallbladder. She has mild hypoxia, possibly due to acute-on-chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, and is receiving inspiratory spirometry treatment. The patient has a history of chest heaviness, which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin, and she is currently on metoprolol and SL nitro as needed.

There is evidence of troponin leak, which may be associated with the patient's known coronary artery disease and severe angina. The patient's diabetes mellitus type II is being managed with insulin sliding scale and held glipizide. She also has hyperlipidemia, depression/dementia, and peripheral arterial disease.

The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is stable for continued ICU care. Her nutrition is being provided through an ADAT (artificially administered tube)."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease. She presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). She had a subsequent contained perforated gallbladder and underwent gallbladder drainage.

The patient is currently experiencing fever and rigors, likely due to the perforated gallbladder. She has mild hypoxia related to acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF, with rales heard in her lungs. Her chest pain, which was initially suspected to be cardiac in nature, was resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin and has not recurred since yesterday morning.

The patient also has a troponin leak, which is likely due to her infectious process and known coronary artery disease with severe angina and triple vessel disease. She is currently on aspirin and Plavix, and her heart rate is well controlled.

The patient has diabetes mellitus type II and is on insulin sliding scale, with her home medication of glipizide being held during her hospital stay. She also has hyperlipidemia and is on zetia and simvastatin.

Mental status is noted as depression/dementia, and she is on multiple psychiatric medications including celexa, remeron,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis, following an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Subsequently, the patient experienced a contained perforated gallbladder and underwent gallbladder drainage.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient already has E. Coli sepsis, which could lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction if not managed appropriately.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing mild hypoxia likely related to acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF. This could progress to respiratory failure if fluid overload occurs or if there are complications with the patient's underlying respiratory status.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and diastolic CHF. The current condition may exacerbate these cardiac issues, leading to further deterioration of cardiac function.

4. Diabetic complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, and it is essential to maintain glycemic control during the ICU stay to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobil"

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis. She returns to the intensive care unit with rigors, hypotension, and fever. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 83/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals crackles heard in the lower left and right lungs, a regular rate and rhythm with occasional ectopic beats, no jugular venous distention or hepatojugular reflux, and a systolic murmur best heard at the left upper sternal border with radiation to the carotids, as well as a systolic holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 30.3 thousand/mm³, elevated troponin levels, elevated lactate levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. The differential shows an increased percentage of neutrophils and bands. Other lab values such as creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within"

   Assessment and Plan
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):
 CHOLANGITIS: Now has percutaneous drain for perforated GB, contained
   abscess.  Growing E.Coli sensitive to CTX.  Also continues flagyl.  WBC
   slightly decreased.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Requiring nasal canula.  Some crackles on exam
   likely secondary to atelectasis (splinting from pain, lying in bed) vs.
   fluid.  At risk for developing PNA.  Get out of bed to chair, insentive
   spirometry, CXR, gentle diuresis with goal of 500 to 1000 cc negative.
   Follow electrolytes.
 ANEMIA:  Hematoma at drain insertion.  Will repeat hct.  No evident
   change in exam.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II:  RISS, diabetic diet.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC: Positive fluid balance,
   crackles on exam.  Gentle diuresis as above.
 H/O CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE):  Denies
   chest pain.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of cholangitis. The patient underwent ERCP and had a contained perforated gallbladder with an abscess, for which a percutaneous drain was placed. The patient is hemodynamically stable and is receiving IV maintenance fluids due to poor oral intake. Pain continues to be present at a level of 6-10 on a pain scale. Allergies include eggs, with an unknown specific allergy. The patient received antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Ceftriaxone, and Metronidazole) at various times. Heparin sodium is being given as a prophylaxis, and morphine sulfate is being administered for pain management.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration and E. Coli sepsis after undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). She also had a contained perforated gallbladder and subsequently received gallbladder drainage.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Fever and rigors: These symptoms are likely due to the perforated gallbladder. The underlying cause of the perforation is unclear. The patient is currently being managed with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone and metronidazole, as per the Infectious Disease (ID) recommendations. ID will follow up regarding the duration of antibiotic treatment. Pain control will be maintained with morphine.

2. Hypoxia: Mild hypoxia is present, possibly related to acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF given the presence of rales (crackles heard in the lungs). Fluid boluses will be given as needed to support blood pressure and urine output. The respiratory status will be closely monitored due to the patient's do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status. Inspiratory spirometry will be continued, and a chest X-ray will be performed today. Consideration will be given to administering IV Las"

   84 yo female with h/o CHF presenting with cholangitis and now s/p
   perforated GB and with percutaneous drainage in place
   1)Cholangitis--This is complicated by GB perforation with percutaneous
   drainage in place and concern for ongoing leakage requiring chronic
   supression in the setting of current goals of care.  AP and T. Bili
   remain diminished.  No further blood cultures positive and E. Coli
   remains pathogen identified.
   Cholangitis-
   -CTX and Flagyl
   -Have advanced diet and well tolerated by patient report and follow up
   enzymes and WBC count
   Gall Bladder Perforation-
   -Drain in place, source of perforation may well be area of necrosis and
   long term drainage seems likely to be required
   -Will need to consider chronic supression with antibiotics but will
   defer to ID service on suggestions
   -Pain control well effected with MSO4
   2)Congestive heart Failure--Diastolic and Acute on Chronic-
   -Lopressor in place, rate well controlled
   -Will use Lasix PRN
   -O2 in place with support with 2 liters
   3)PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   -MSO4 with good effect
   4)Hypoxia
this is multifactorial and currently dominated by
   atelectasis, mild fluid overload and splinting with pain.
   -Incentive Spirometry
   -OOB to chair

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, who presented with cholangitis and has since undergone percutaneous drainage due to a perforated gallbladder. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/54 mmHg to 128/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient has been tolerating regular diet and Lasix well, with urine output ranging from 35-50 cc/hr.

The patient's physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, crackles in the lateral bases of the chest, and a systolic murmur. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal kidney function. Imaging shows no free air on chest X-ray, good positioning of the gallbladder drain, and limited image of the PICC line.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cholangitis - complicated by gallbladder perforation with percutaneous drainage in place. The patient will continue on ceftriaxone and metronidazole, and may require long-term antibiotic suppression.
2. Congestive heart failure - diastolic and acute on chronic. The patient will continue on l"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration, E. Coli sepsis, and a perforated gallbladder, for which a gallbladder drain was placed.

The patient's fever and rigors have resolved, but they were likely related to the perforated gallbladder. The underlying cause of the perforation is unclear. The patient has been receiving intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and flagyl as per the Infectious Disease (ID) recommendation. It is planned to follow up with the ID regarding a chronic suppressive oral regimen.

The patient also experiences mild hypoxia, which is likely related to acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF given the presence of rales. Evidence of fluid overload is seen on physical examination. To manage this, inspiratory spirometry has been started 10 times per hour, a chest X-ray will be done today, and lasix 40mg PO will be initiated. The patient should also be encouraged to get out of bed.

The patient's chest pain has resolved, which was a history of chest heaviness that resolved within a minute with sublingual nitroglycerin. No further episodes have occurred since yesterday morning. The patient's home medications include"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented with cholangitis secondary to stent migration with E. Coli sepsis after undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient subsequently developed a contained perforated gallbladder and had a gallbladder drain placed.

The patient's fever and rigors have resolved, but she remains hypoxic with mild hypoxia likely related to acute-on-chronic diastolic CHF. There are also signs of fluid overload on physical examination. The patient's chest pain, which resolved after taking sublingual nitroglycerin, was likely related to her history of coronary artery disease.

The patient's diabetes mellitus type II is being managed with insulin sliding scale and a hold on oral glipizide. She also has hyperlipidemia, depression/dementia, and is on various medications including ceftriaxone, flagyl, morphine, metoprolol, aspirin, Plavix, zetia, simvastatin, celexa, remeron, and abilify.

The patient has been advised to continue with inspiratory spirometry, lasix, and to monitor input/output with a goal of negative fluid balance. She is currently on a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) code status and is stable for continuation of care in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening of CHF, infection due to E. Coli sepsis, further complications from the contained perforated gallbladder, and potential respiratory issues due to hypoxia and fluid overload."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with stent and cholangitis now complicated by perforation
   of gall bladder who now has reasonable improvement with drainage and
   ongoing ABX Rx.  Specifically, she has improvement in WBC count and
   remains without fever.
   1)Cholangitis-
   -WIll continue abx for chronic course
   2)Gallbladder Performation-
   -Drain in place but without discrete loculation is some concern for
   chronic spread of bacterial pathogens leading to consideration of
   chronic ABX
   -CTX/Flagyl
   -Will consider timing of re-peat of CT scan for [**8-17**]
   3)Pain Control-
   -MSO4 and Tylenol

   Comments:
   Communication:  Comments: Will need clear plan for care going forward
   and this will require sit down discussion with case management in
   regards to what is possible and this to be matched with patient and
   family priorities in regards to location where this can be maintained.
   Important in this is establishement of simplified ABX regimen if
   possible

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of stent placement and cholangitis, who has now developed gallbladder perforation. The patient is currently in the ICU and is showing signs of improvement with ongoing antibiotic therapy. Her white blood cell count is decreasing, and she remains afebrile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis - The patient will continue to receive antibiotics for the chronic course of cholangitis. There is a concern for chronic spread of bacterial pathogens due to the presence of a drain without discrete loculation, which may require consideration of chronic antibiotic therapy.
2. Gallbladder Perforation - The drain is currently in place, but there is concern for chronic spread of bacterial pathogens. This may lead to the consideration of chronic antibiotic therapy.
3. Pain Control - The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate and Tylenol for pain management.
4. Ineffective Coping - The patient's coping mechanisms may be ineffective in managing her pain and discomfort.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type II - The patient has a history of diabetes, which may require ongoing management and monitoring of blood glucose levels.
6. Constipation - The patient has a history of constipation, which may require appropriate management and interventions.
7. Heart Failure (Chronic Diastolic) - The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, which may require ongoing monitoring and management.
8. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD/Is"
