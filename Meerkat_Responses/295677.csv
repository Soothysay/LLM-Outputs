","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to delirium and agitation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/53 to 154/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits at 37.3°C (99.2°F). 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The creatinine level is slightly elevated, while the troponin-T level is within normal limits. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, liver function tests, and kidney function tests are also provided.

The patient's diagnosis includes severe tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, agitated delirium, hypernatremia, recent pneumonia, liver dysfunction, possible urinary tract infection, alcohol abuse, and diarrhea. The plan includes maintaining PSV support, tapering steroids from IV to oral, starting quetiapine for delirium, correcting hypernatremia with D5W, repeating CBC, sputum culture,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, delirium, hypernatremia, recent pneumonia, liver issues, possible UTI, alcohol abuse, and diarrhea. She was found unresponsive at home and intubated. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchial malacia: This condition can lead to airway collapse, making breathing difficult. The patient's ongoing intubation is necessary to maintain airway patency.

2. COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease): Although her respiratory status is currently stable, there is a risk of exacerbation due to factors such as infections or stress. Proper management with nebulizers and tapering steroids will be important.

3. Agitated delirium: The patient is experiencing agitation and confusion. It is crucial to monitor her mental status and provide appropriate medications to manage delirium.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration and other complications. It is important to continue correcting the fluid deficit with D5W (5% dextrose in water) and monitor electrolyte levels.

5. Recent pneumonia: Although her respiratory status is currently stable, there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of symptoms. Repeat CBC (complete blood count) and sputum culture should be done"

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, alcohol abuse, recent pneumonia, and potential liver damage. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. The patient has been sedated due to agitated delirium but is now stable. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to undergo Y-stent placement on Thursday.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/51 to 132/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her temperature is within normal range.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and mildly elevated creatinine level. Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Other lab values, including liver function tests and cardiac markers, are either normal or within acceptable limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals intubation, normal heart sounds, and soft abdomen. Chest X-ray images are available but not described in the note.

The patient's plan includes maintaining ventilatory support, planning for Y-stent placement, holding tube feeds, and administering various medications such as sedatives, antacids, and antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe respiratory distress. He has a history of alcohol abuse and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 116/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and a temperature of 36.7°C. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 72 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg. His laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count (Plt). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level (K+). The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa, and he has received various medications including midazolam, fentanyl"

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, agitated delirium, hypernatremia, recent pneumonia, liver injury, alcohol abuse, and diarrhea. She was found unresponsive at home and intubated. The patient is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Tracheobronchial malacia: This condition can lead to airway collapse and difficulty breathing, especially during mechanical ventilation. The patient may require ongoing intubation and ventilatory support.

2. COPD: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if not managed properly. She may require nebulizer treatments and a gradual tapering of steroids.

3. Delirium: The patient's agitation and confusion can increase the risk of complications such as falls, self-extubation, and inadequate oxygenation. Sedation may be necessary to manage her delirium.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient previously had high levels of sodium in her blood. It is important to monitor her electrolyte levels and ensure appropriate fluid management to prevent further complications.

5. Recent pneumonia: Although the patient's respiratory status is currently stable, there is still a risk of worsening infection or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is important.

6. Liver injury: The patient's liver function tests (L"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, alcohol abuse, and delirium. She was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. The patient's current condition includes severe tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, agitation, and delirium. She is currently sedated and undergoing mechanical ventilation. The patient also has hypernatremia, which is being treated with D5W and electrolyte replacement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Airway obstruction: Due to the severe tracheobronchial malacia, there is a risk of complete airway collapse, especially during extubation. Continuous monitoring and support are necessary to maintain airway patency.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Adequate lung secretion clearance techniques and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be implemented to prevent this complication.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be used to prevent DVT.

4. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and sedation increase the risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers should be administered to prevent this complication.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with respiratory failure likely due to airway obstruction from tracheobronchomalacia. She is currently in the ICU and has a history of underlying COPD. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 92/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 12, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and plateau pressure of 15 cmH2O. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to airway obstruction from tracheobronchomalacia.
2. Hypernatremia, with a sodium level of 147 mEq/L. This is being addressed with D5W repletion.
3. Agitated delirium, possibly related to EtOHism, but withdrawal is not currently an issue. Management includes minimizing sedatives and using Seroquel as needed.
4. Ileus, with tube feeds held due to little residuals. Promotility agents may be considered if continued.
5. Slow atrial fibrillation that resolved with propofol discontinuation.
6. Allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides).
7. The patient has a history of underlying COPD and may require CPAP when awake.
8. An IP consult has been requested for stent placement to address tracheobronchomalacia.
9. The patient is at risk for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

The patient is a 57-year-old female with respiratory failure, likely due to airway obstruction from tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, and an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 92/44 mmHg, temperature of 36.7°C, and a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the slow atrial fibrillation that resolved with propofol discontinuation.

The patient has several allergies, including penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides). The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 4 mg/hour, fentanyl at a rate of 125 mcg/hour, and lorazepam (Ativan) at a dose of [**2169-3-22**] 04:59 PM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, alcohol abuse, and delirium. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. The patient has been sedated and is currently in the ICU. She has been intubated due to severe tracheobronchial malacia and is receiving ventilatory support. A Y-stent placement was done today. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has shown alterations in nutrition, delirium/confusion, and hypernatremia. She also has a history of alcohol abuse and COPD. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and elevated potassium levels. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including sedatives, antibiotics, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchial Malacia: The patient's severe tracheobronchial malacia can lead to recurrent airway collapse, which may require ongoing intubation and ventilatory support.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD increases the risk of exacerbations, especially while she is on mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early identification of worsening symptoms are crucial.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse puts her at risk for withdrawal symptoms. Monitoring for signs and symptoms"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She was transferred to the ICU due to severe tracheobronchial malacia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of COPD, agitation and delirium, alcohol abuse, and diarrhea (C. diff negative). She also has hypernatremia, which is being treated with D5W and electrolyte replacement. The patient is receiving tube feeds, and her code status is full code. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability can lead to the formation of blood clots in the deep veins.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Delirium: The patient's agitation and confusion may worsen, requiring close monitoring and management.
5. Alcohol withdrawal: If the patient's alcohol abuse history is significant, there is a risk of withdrawal symptoms, which can be managed with appropriate medications.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels need to be monitored and managed carefully to prevent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with respiratory failure, tuberculosis (TBM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She underwent stent placement yesterday and is currently in the ICU. The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. She is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, heparin sodium, and haloperidol. The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged except for the noted events. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 96/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory support, and an FiO2 of 50%. She has a history of ileus, hypernatremia, and delirium. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but normal electrolyte levels. The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, alcohol abuse, and delirium. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 90/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchial malacia: The patient has severe tracheobronchial malacia, which is causing ongoing airway collapse when the endotracheal tube is withdrawn. This condition requires ongoing intubation and ventilatory support.
2. COPD: The patient has COPD that is currently stable without wheezing. However, there is a need to wean off ventilatory support as tolerated.
3. Delirium: The patient was initially agitated and delirious upon admission but is now sedated.
4. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and appropriate interventions have been made to manage this issue.
5. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, but C. diff has been ruled out.

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been diagnosed with severe tracheobronchial malacia and underwent Y-stent placement. The patient is currently experiencing significant secretions, and there is a plan to wean her off ventilatory support to partial support ventilation (PSV) and then try spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). However, it is likely that she will require a tracheostomy.

The patient also has a history of COPD, for which nebs (nebulizers) are being used as needed, and a tapering dose of steroids. She was admitted with agitated delirium, which is now being managed with sedation. The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia, and D5W (5% dextrose in water) and pm lytes (potassium) are being given. Tube feeds are planned, with a formula of IVFs (intravenous fluids) and replete lytes (electrolytes) as needed. Prophylaxis measures include PPI (proton pump inhibitor), heparin subcutaneously (SQ), and a bowel regimen.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/63 to 145/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.30. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and kidney function. However, her sodium levels are slightly elevated, and her potassium levels are on the lower side.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and hyperglycemia due to tube feeds and IV fluids. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions will be necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been admitted to the ICU for severe tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, agitated delirium, hypernatremia, and other medical conditions. The patient underwent Y-stent placement but continues to have significant secretions and difficulty weaning from ventilatory support. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, RR set at 12, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 100%. Her vital signs include Tcurrent of 36.8°C, HR of 66 bpm, BP of 109/63 mmHg, RR of 14 inspiratory breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. She is agitated and moving all four extremities, opens eyes spontaneously, follows commands, and has warm, dry skin with no edema. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheostomy placement: The patient's tracheobronchial malacia has led to significant secretions and difficulty weaning from ventilatory support. A tracheostomy is planned to help alleviate these issues and improve her respiratory status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, and alcohol abuse. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. She is currently in the ICU, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving various medications including propofol, famotidine, haloperidol, and heparin. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/63 mmHg to 145/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is being weaned off ventilatory support and is expected to undergo tracheostomy. Her laboratory results show elevated sodium levels, decreased potassium levels, and normal white blood cell count. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheostomy: The patient is likely to undergo tracheostomy, which carries potential risks such as bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding structures.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can be a life-threatening infection.
3. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium, and sedation reduction may lead to agitation or confusion.
4. Hypernatremia:"

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of alcohol abuse, tracheobronchomalacia, delirium, and confusion. The patient's sodium levels were fluctuating, ranging from 150 in the morning to 140 in the afternoon and increasing again overnight due to water boluses being held. The patient was switched from assist control (AC) to pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode on the ventilator. The possibility of tracheostomy was discussed with the patient's boyfriend and brother.

The patient is on multiple medications including propofol infusion, famotidine, haloperidol, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/63 mmHg to 145/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,087 mL, including 467 mL of PO, 199 mL of TF, and 938 mL of IVF. The output includes 2,595 mL of total out, 895 mL of which is urine output. The NG drain output is 15 mL, and there is a negative fluid balance of 508 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old obese woman with COPD who was transferred from another hospital due to acute respiratory failure, likely pneumonia. She underwent a Y stent placement and has been intubated for 21 days. She continues to experience respiratory failure, which is multifactorial and related to tracheobronchomalacia, underlying COPD, airway secretions, and agitation. Her current medications include bronchodilators, prednisone, theophylline, Seroquel, and propofol. She also has hypernatremia and agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, likely due to a combination of factors including diffuse airway malacia, underlying COPD, airway secretions related to the stent, and agitation. This is a critical condition that requires close monitoring and management.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can lead to dehydration and neurological complications if not corrected promptly.
3. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which can increase the risk of self-extubation, physical injury, and other complications. It is important to address this issue through appropriate medication adjustments and other interventions.
4. Pneumonia: Given the presence of mixed organisms in the sputum and pending culture results, there is a risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt antibiotic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed.

The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note, but the 24-hour events indicate several important observations. These include an improved serum sodium level to 144 with free water, a transient episode of hypoxia to the 80s that resolved spontaneously, and the advanced endotracheal tube (ETT) 4 cm under fluoroscopic guidance.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides). She is currently on various medications such as propofol, heparin sodium, famotidine (Pepcid), fentanyl, and other ICU medications.

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home on 03/07/2169 and subsequently underwent intubation. She is currently in the ICU.

The patient's recent events include an upcoming surgical tracheostomy scheduled for tomorrow. She had a transient episode of hypoxia to the 80s, but her oxygen saturation returned to 100 without any intervention after being placed on the pillow by nurse [**First Name (Titles) 6085**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. An endotracheal tube advancement was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] under fluoroscopic guidance. 

The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. She has allergies to penicillins, causing a rash and blisters; tetracycline, causing a rash; and sulfa (sulfonamides), also causing a rash. Her last dose of antibiotics was on 03/27/2169 at 02:46 PM. She is currently receiving propofol at 40 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications including heparin sodium (prophylaxis) at 03/27/2169 02:46 PM, famotidine (Pepcid) at 03/27/2169 08:00 PM, and fentanyl at 03/28/2169 04:00 AM. 

Her vital signs are as follows: Temperature (Tmax): 37.7°C (99.8°F), Tcurrent: 36.7°C (98.1°F), Heart rate (HR): 65 bpm (46 - 77 bpm), Blood pressure (BP): 101/58 mmHg (68/45 - 143/67 mmHg), Respiratory rate (RR): 12 breaths per minute (10 - 21 breaths per minute), Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 100%, and Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance with total input of 2,656 mL and total output of 2,745 mL. The patient is receiving nutrition through tube feeds at 20 mL/hour. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with a set tidal volume of 400 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.26 and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 148 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.8 g/dL, elevated potassium (K+) of 26 mEq/L, decreased sodium (Na+) of 83 mg/dL, decreased chloride (Cl-) of 1.3 mg/dL, decreased bicarbonate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, currently admitted to the ICU. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. Her vital signs are stable, but she is agitated and delirious. She has severe tracheobronchial malacia and requires a surgical tracheostomy. She also has COPD and is being treated with nebs and prednisone. Her sodium levels have improved, but she had a transient episode of hypoxia. She is tolerating tube feeds and IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to her tracheobronchial malacia and COPD, the patient is at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, and exacerbation of COPD symptoms.
2. Delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium can lead to complications such as falls, self-extubation, and increased risk of pressure ulcers.
3. Hypernatremia: Although her sodium levels have improved, there is still a risk of electrolyte imbalances and dehydration.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections due to her prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and agitation increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a sedated adult admitted to the ICU with unknown chief complaint due to inability to provide history. The patient has multiple medical conditions, allergies, and is on several medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there have been episodes of hypoxia and transient drops in blood pressure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and has been receiving various infusions and medications for sedation, pain management, and prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and culture results from sputum samples is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Regular assessment for signs of DVT and consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation may be required.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of stress ulcers. Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding and providing prophylactic medications may be necessary.
4. Medication interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, including sedatives, analgesics, and antibiotics. Close monitoring for potential drug interactions and adverse effects is essential.
5. Delirium: Sedation and the ICU environment can contribute to delirium. Regular"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, was found unresponsive at home on [**2169-3-7**] and subsequently underwent intubation. She has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's condition has been fluctuating. On [**3-28**], her sodium levels were elevated, and she experienced frequent stooling. Narcan was stopped as it may have been causing ileus. Seroquel dosage was increased to 75mg po bid due to agitation. Lidocaine was started for cough suppression, which may be contributing to emesis. She had a temperature of 101.2°F in the setting of hypotension, decreased urine output, two episodes of emesis, and increased sputum production. Tube feeds were stopped due to emesis. Treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was initiated empirically with cefepime and vancomycin. A repeat chest X-ray showed no increased opacity or effusion. She received a total of 2 liters of normal saline to maintain urine output and propofol dosage was decreased to 20mcg. The decision to perform a tracheostomy is still uncertain, pending consultation with the thoracic surgeon.

On [**3-29**], the patient's temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure was 129/59 mmHg, heart rate was "

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient is unresponsive and unable to provide a medical history. He has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides). The patient received vancomycin and cefepime infusions. He is currently on several medications including famotidine, fentanyl, and heparin sodium.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/59 mmHg to 140/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,571 mL and output of 2,070 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring, blood products, urine output, NG output, stool, drainages, and respiratory support are also noted.

Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's unresponsive state. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and altered mental status could indicate a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and subsequently underwent intubation. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications and conditions, including severe tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, agitated delirium, hypernatremia, and potential nutrition alteration due to alcohol abuse.

From the note, we can observe the following potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Tracheobronchial malacia: The patient has a severe form of this condition, which causes airway collapse. This can lead to respiratory distress and difficulty with ventilation support.
2. COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease): Although the patient's respiratory status is currently stable, this chronic condition can worsen over time and lead to further complications such as repeated infections, decreased lung function, and increased risk of respiratory failure.
3. Agitated delirium: The patient has been experiencing intermittent agitation, which may be related to narcotic withdrawal. If left untreated, this can progress into severe agitation, confusion, and increased risk of falls or injury.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating a potential electrolyte imbalance. If not addressed, this can lead to dehydration, neurological complications, and organ dysfunction.
5. Potential nutrition alteration: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which may have affected"

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been in the ICU since then.

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient's sodium levels were initially elevated but improved with the administration of D5W.
- She experienced frequent stooling, which led to stopping narcan (which was started for ileus) and increasing the dose of seroquel to 75mg po bid due to agitation.
- The patient had a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit in the setting of hypotension, decreased urine output, two episodes of emesis, and increased sputum production. Tube feeds were stopped due to emesis.
- She was started on treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with cefepime and vancomycin empirically.
- Repeat chest X-ray showed no increased opacity or effusion.
- The patient's heart rate became bradycardic to 40 bpm overnight, and propofol was weaned.
- Allergies include penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa.
- The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate 48 bpm, blood pressure 129/59 mmHg, respiratory rate 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 100%, and sinus bradycardia.

   # DISPO: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been admitted to the ICU with several medical complications.

1. Tracheobronchial malacia: The patient has severe tracheobronchial malacia, which is characterized by the collapse of the airways. She underwent Y-stent placement but continues to have significant secretions and difficulty weaning from ventilatory support. Surgery has evaluated her condition.

2. COPD: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but currently, she is not wheezing, and her respiratory status is stable. She was admitted to the hospital on methylprednisolone 40 mg IV daily. Treatment recommendations include nebs (nebulizers) as needed, discontinuing theophylline, tapering steroids to 20 mg daily, and closely monitoring her respiratory status.

3. Agitated delirium: The patient appears intermittently agitated and has been diagnosed with agitated delirium. This may be related to narcotic withdrawal. Treatment recommendations include starting scheduled fentanyl boluses at 25 mcg every 4 hours and continuing quetiapine.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has persistent hypernatremia with a sodium level of 151. Treatment recommendations include continuing D5W (5"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been admitted to the ICU with several medical complications and conditions.

The patient's recent events include:
- Blood and sputum cultures were obtained on [**2169-3-28**] at 03:55 PM.
- The patient's sodium levels were elevated, so D5W (5% dextrose in water) was restarted to maintain hydration.
- Due to frequent stooling, narcan was stopped as it was started for ileus.
- The patient's agitation persisted, so the dose of seroquel was increased to 75mg po bid.
- Lidocaine was started q12h for cough suppression, as it may be causing or contributing to emesis.
- The patient had a temperature of 101.2°F in the setting of hypotension, decreased urine output, two episodes of emesis, and increased sputum production.
- Tube feeds were stopped due to emesis.
- Treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with cefepime and vancomycin was initiated.
- Repeat chest X-ray showed no significant changes.
- The patient received a total of 2 L of lactated Ringer's solution to maintain urine output and decreased propofol to 20mcg.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require attention. 

1. Tracheobronchial Malacia: The patient has severe tracheobronchial malacia, which is causing significant secretions. A Y-stent placement was performed, but the plan for tracheostomy placement is uncertain as it is unclear if the stent should be kept in place during trach.

2. Hypotension/Fever: The patient is experiencing hypotension and fever, which could be due to sedation or sepsis. Increased sputum production and recent vomiting increase the risk of aspiration. A chest X-ray showed no significant change compared to prior.

3. Bradycardia: The patient has sinus bradycardia, which is likely due to sedation. Scheduled Fentanyl should be held, and propofol should be decreased as tolerated.

4. COPD: The patient has COPD, but is currently not wheezing. Respiratory status is stable, and she arrived at the hospital with methylprednisolone 40 mg IV daily. Nebulizers can be used as needed, and steroids should be continued at a dose of 20 mg daily.

5. Agitated Delirium: The patient continues to appear intermitt"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. The patient has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's condition has been fluctuating. She experienced an episode of emesis, fever, and subsequent hypotension overnight. Her vital signs show a temperature of 99.3°F, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 109/53 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has tracheobronchial malacia, which is causing respiratory failure. She also has pneumonia and a history of alcohol abuse. The patient is hypernatremic.

The plan includes continuing antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), discontinuing prednisone, discussing the delay in performing a tracheostomy with the surgical attending, and adding more free water for hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to tracheobronchial malacia. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to further deterioration in her respiratory status and potential need for long-term ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can worsen if not treated effectively. It may lead to sepsis and systemic complications.

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently hemodynamically stable. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 109/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. She is also receiving propofol infusion at a rate of 30 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating a possible infection. Her blood glucose level is within normal range. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and cardiac enzymes, are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's tube feeds were stopped due to emesis, but she requires nutrition support.
2. Tracheobronchial Malacia: The patient has severe tracheobronchial malacia, and a plan for tracheostomy is being considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been in the ICU since then. The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including nutrition alteration, tracheobronchial malacia, delirium/confusion, aspiration pneumonia versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), hypotension, bradycardia, COPD, hypernatremia, and tube feeds stopped due to emesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchial malacia: This condition can lead to respiratory distress and recurrent infections due to the weakness in the trachea and bronchi.
2. Delirium/confusion: The patient may experience disorientation, hallucinations, and an altered level of consciousness. It is important to address the underlying cause of delirium and manage it appropriately.
3. Aspiration pneumonia versus HAP: The patient may develop respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Antibiotic treatment may be necessary depending on the causative organism.
4. Hypotension: The patient may experience low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate perfusion of organs and tissues. IV fluids and vasopressor medications may be required to maintain blood pressure within normal range.
5. Bradycardia: The patient may have a slower than normal heart rate, which can be caused by"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a current FiO2 of 50%. Propofol is being infused at 20 mcg/kg/min. Other medications include famotidine, heparin sodium, and fentanyl. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate between 68-95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/49-145/61 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has received several blood transfusions over the past few days. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or odor is crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin sodium infusion should be continued.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and mechanical ventilation. Proton pump inhibitors like famotidine should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 104/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is also receiving propofol for sedation and fentanyl for pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonitis vs HAP: The patient has been treated for possible aspiration pneumonitis and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with antibiotics. Sputum samples have been collected for further evaluation.
2. Severe Tracheobronchial Malacia: The patient has a history of tracheobronchial malacia, and the plan is to perform a tracheostomy today.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure was initially low, but it has since resolved. It is important to continue monitoring her blood pressure.
4. Bradycardia: The patient experienced bradycardia, which was likely due to sedation. This condition has resolved, but it should still be monitored.
5. COPD: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and her"

   # DISPO: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been in the ICU since then. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving propofol sedation, and has multiple IV lines. She has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and severe tracheobronchial malacia, for which a tracheostomy is planned. She also has hypotension, bradycardia, COPD, agitated delirium, hypernatremia, and is on tube feeds. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 104/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her WBC count is elevated at 173 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheostomy: The patient is planned for a tracheostomy due to severe tracheobronchial malacia. Complications associated with tracheostomy include bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, tracheal stenosis, and damage to structures in the neck.
2. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory status, sepsis, and"

   # DISPO: ICU
","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to her condition.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which has been resolved. She also had bradycardia, which is likely due to sedation and has resolved as well. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and she remains afebrile with normal WBC count. However, sputum sample showed oropharyngeal flora and yeast.

The patient has severe tracheobronchial malacia and a plan for tracheostomy has been made. She is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's nutritional status is a concern as she is not tolerating tube feeds and there are plans to discuss percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) after tracheostomy.

The patient is also experiencing agitation and delirium, which has improved with the administration of Fentanyl. Quetiapine is being continued to manage agitation.

Hypernatremia has been identified, and the patient is being treated with D5W to correct it. Laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate, while levels of sodium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal limits. The patient's liver enzymes and renal function are also within normal limits.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse. Trache"

 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status and respiratory distress. The patient was intubated due to severe hypoxia and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with tracheobronchomalacia and is awaiting tracheostomy placement. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 97/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated sodium level of 138 K/uL, slightly low potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L, and normal white blood cell count of 8.6 K/uL. Other lab values, including creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes, are within normal range.

The patient has been receiving propofol for sedation, fentanyl for pain management, and famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis. He has also been receiving IV fluids and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to intolerance to tube feeds.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for episodes of hypotension overnight with sedation and severe agitation when the propofol dose is decreased. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. The patient has been in the ICU since then.

- The patient's current condition: She remains afebrile with normal white blood cell count. She is on mechanical ventilation and has stable respiratory status. The sputum sample showed oropharyngeal flora and yeast, but she has remained afebrile for 48 hours.
- Severe tracheobronchial malacia: The plan is to perform a tracheostomy on Monday or Tuesday with the assistance of interventional procedures (IP) and bypass.
- Hypotension: The patient experiences intermittent hypotension, likely due to sedation. Propofol dosage has been decreased, and fluids are given as needed.
- COPD: The patient is not currently wheezing, but nebulizers are provided as needed. Predisone has been discontinued.
- Agitated delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium have improved with fentanyl and seroquel. Fentanyl boluses are given every four hours, and quetiapine is administered at a dose of 75 mg.
- Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have improved with D5W. She will continue to receive D5W at a rate of 100 cc per hour for two liters per"

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with various medical conditions. 

1. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which have been resolved. It is likely due to sedation, and the propofol dose has been decreased. The patient will continue to be monitored.

2. Bradycardia: The patient also had bradycardia, which has resolved. It is believed to be a result of sedation, and the patient's heart rhythm is now stable.

3. Tracheobronchial malacia: The patient has severe tracheobronchial malacia, and a plan for tracheostomy (trach) has been made. The procedure will be performed on Monday with an intensivist present and bypass ventilation.

4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient presented with agitation and delirium upon admission. This has improved with the administration of Fentanyl. Scheduled Fentanyl boluses will continue to be given to the patient. Quetiapine will also be continued at a dose of 75 mg from [Hospital1].

5. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD, but currently, she is not wheezing. Nebulizer treatments will be provided as needed, and the use of pre"

   setting of acute resp failure from presumed pna, s/p Y stent here on
   [**3-23**], persistent resp failure related to secretions and agitation, and
   TBM. Plan for trach.
   Continuing supportive care at this time. Will continue to treat for
   VAP. She appears well enough to be placed back on pressure support. The
   current anti-delirium regimen appears to be working well.
   Will restart the chemical dvt ppx

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home on [**2169-3-7**] and subsequently underwent intubation. She has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including Propofol, Famotidine, Heparin Sodium, Haloperidol, Cefepime, and Vancomycin. She also has multiple lines inserted, including a PICC line and an 18-gauge line.

Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/47 to 154/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Her lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly increased platelet count. Her electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly high sodium level.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia, alteration in nutrition, tracheobronchomalacia, delirium/confusion, aspiration pneumonitis versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), severe tracheobronchial malacia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypernatremia.

The plan for the patient includes continuing with Cefepime"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/47 to 154/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has received various medications including propofol, famotidine, heparin, and haloperidol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchial malacia: The patient's history of tracheobronchial malacia puts her at risk for recurrent episodes of airway obstruction and respiratory distress.
2. Pneumonia: Given the patient's unresponsive state and intubation, she is at an increased risk for aspiration pneumonia. The presence of oropharyngeal flora and yeast in her sputum sample suggests a possible infection.
3. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing agitated delirium, which can be caused by sedative medications, underlying medical conditions, or withdrawal symptoms.
4. Hypotension: The patient has intermittent episodes of hypotension, which may be due to sedation from propofol or other medications.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and intubated. She has been in the ICU since then.

The patient's chief complaint is delirium and confusion, which has improved with medication but continues to be a daily issue due to limited sedation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 102/47 to 154/70 mmHg, heart rate between 65-114 bpm, respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, her sodium levels are high, and her potassium levels are slightly low. Her creatinine levels are within normal range.

The patient has several medical conditions, including hypotension (not in shock), electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia, alteration in nutrition, tracheobronchial malacia, delirium/confusion, and COPD.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing antibiotics, sending another sputum culture, performing bronchial washing cultures, and planning for tracheostomy. She is also being monitored for hypotension, with adjustments to her sedation medication. Her tube feeding has been restarted at a lower rate, and she will require total parent"

   unresponsive at home, respiratory failure, VAP, now awaiting trach.
   She is being treated for VAP and we are adjusting vancomycin dosing
   based on levels. Awaiting bronchial wash culture results. Low grade
   temp elevation overnight
 will monitor and culture if needed.
   Plan for trach on Monday with bypass backup given severity of TBM.
   Today will adjust sedation from propofol back to Fentanyl prn and gtt.
   Overall, the anti-delirum treatment appears to be adequate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with COPD who was found unresponsive at home and is currently in the ICU. She is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and awaiting a tracheostomy. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, and she is sedated. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 107/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. She has received vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics. Her current medications include propofol, heparin sodium, haloperidol, fentanyl, Pepcid, Colace, MVI, albuterol, and Narcan. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for a fever. Physical examination shows no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, warm skin, and normal heart sounds. The patient's labs indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and normal kidney and liver function. Imaging shows persistent opacities on chest X-ray, and microbiology results for bronchial washings are pending. The patient's plan includes adjusting vancomycin dosing based on levels, awaiting bronchial wash culture results, and proceeding with tracheostomy on Monday. Sedation will be"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2169-3-28**].

Key findings and concerns include:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which improved when fentanyl and midazolam were stopped. This suggests that sedation may have been a contributing factor.

2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient does not have a fever and has a normal white blood cell count. Her respiratory status is stable, and she is awaiting bronchial washings and sputum culture results. She is being continued on cefepime and vancomycin for an 8-day course.

3. Severe tracheobronchial malacia: The patient is planned for tracheostomy today by surgery and interventional procedures (IP) with bypass. This is likely due to her severe tracheobronchial malacia.

4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient does not have any active issues related to COPD. Nebulizers are being used as needed.

5. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, for which she is receiving fentanyl through a gastrointestinal tube. She is also being given ser"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

The patient's medical history includes alcoholism, COPD, severe tracheobronchial malacia, and pneumonia. She is currently being treated with antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and her respiratory status is stable. However, she remains hypotensive and has shown signs of delirium.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to her tracheobronchial malacia. If not properly managed, she may continue to struggle with adequate gas exchange.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and if not appropriately treated, there is a risk of the infection spreading and worsening her respiratory condition.

3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and it is possible that she may experience an exacerbation of her condition while in the ICU. This could lead to further respiratory distress.

4. Delirium: The patient is showing signs of delirium, which can be a common complication in critically ill patients. If not addressed, it can lead to increased agitation, difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation, and longer ICU stays.

5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension needs to be closely monitored and managed. If not addressed promptly, it can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

In summary, the potential medical complications in this case include respiratory failure, pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, delirium, and hypotension."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. The patient has been in the ICU since then.

24-hour events include changing the fentanyl infusion to reduce rebound agitation, suctioning a large mucus plug from the tracheostomy, and experiencing hypotension in the 80s at 0230. The hypotension was addressed by stopping fentanyl and midazolam and administering a 1L bolus.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin and cefepime.

The patient is currently on multiple infusions, including fentanyl, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and famotidine (Pepcid). Other medications include midazolam and various ICU medications.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data as of [**2169-4-3**] 06:12 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 72 bpm (64-86 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 93/42 mmHg to 74/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute (14-25 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 72.2 kg, with a decrease from admission weight of 80.8 kg. Total fluid input since [**71**] AM is 4,006 mL, including 1,765 mL of IV fluids. Total output includes 1,516 mL of urine and 483 mL of blood products. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode.

Physical examination findings are not assessed in peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other areas due to the patient's intubation.

Lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, normal hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Kidney function is within normal range, with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab results are mostly within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include hypotension potentially related to sedation, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with stable respiratory status, severe tracheobronchial malacia requiring tracheostomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without active issues, and agitation managed with fentanyl boluses.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension, development of HAP or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential complications related to tracheostomy placement."

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia, alteration in nutrition, tracheomalacia, delirium/confusion, history of alcohol abuse, and COPD.

Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely related to sedation as pressures improved when fentanyl and midazolam were stopped.

HAP (Healthcare-associated pneumonia): The patient remains afebrile with normal white blood cell count. Her respiratory status is stable, and she will be followed up with bronchial washings results and sputum culture from 4/2. She will continue on cefepime and vancomycin for an 8-day course starting on 3/28.

Severe tracheobronchial malacia: The plan is to perform a tracheostomy today by surgery and initiate intermittent positive airway pressure (IP) with bypass.

COPD: There are no active issues with the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Nebulizer treatments will be given as needed.

Agitation: The patient is on fentanyl and continues to receive seroquel and bupropion.

Nutrition: The patient's tube feeds will be continued at the new goal as tolerated. If any obstacles arise, total"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently underwent intubation. She is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia (high sodium), alteration in nutrition, tracheobronchomalacia, delirium/confusion, fever/leukocytosis, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of tracheobronchial malacia, which increases the risk of aspiration. The loose stool and recent increase in tube feeds may suggest the possibility of aspiration leading to pneumonia.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a concern for VAP. The current treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin), but the cultures' results are still pending.

3. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which could be due to various factors such as sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, or medication effects.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which indicates an imbalance in sodium levels. This can be potentially dangerous and requires careful management.

5. Tracheobronchomalacia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She is currently in the ICU for further management. The patient has been experiencing fever, with a temperature of 102.4 this morning, and her WBC count is within the range of 5.9 - 9.7. There is no evidence of new infiltrate or consolidation on the chest X-ray to suggest aspiration. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and she is currently sedated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and management of her respiratory status are necessary.
2. Tracheomalacia: The patient has a history of tracheobronchial malacia, which can lead to airway collapse and respiratory distress. A tracheostomy was placed today to secure the airway and provide long-term ventilation support.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, with a sodium level of 148 mEq/L. It is essential to carefully manage her fluid and electrolyte balance to prevent complications associated with high sodium levels.
4. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count may indicate an ongoing infection. Further investigation and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be considered.

 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient has tracheomalacia, which is characterized by weakness and floppiness of the tracheal walls. The patient also has a history of alcohol abuse.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 91/46 mmHg, heart rate of 102 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on endotracheal ventilation with FiO2 at 50%. The patient's weight has decreased from 80.8 kg at admission to 72.2 kg currently.

The patient has received various medications including fentanyl for pain management, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, famotidine (Pepcid), and other medications as per the treatment plan. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin and cefepime.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 4,430 mL and output of 2,583 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,847 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been given tube feeds based on nutrition recommendations.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 5.3 to 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin levels from 10.0 to 33.9 g/dL, blood glucose levels from 83 to 148 mg/dL, sodium levels from 120 to 147 mg/dL, potassium levels from 3.9 to 6 mg/dL, and other electrolyte and enzyme levels within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment includes hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia, alteration in nutrition, tracheobronchomalacia, delirium/confusion, and a history of alcohol abuse.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the provided information include:

1. Tracheomalacia-related complications: The weakness in the tracheal walls may lead to airway obstruction, increased risk of infection, and difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion, increasing the risk of organ damage and potential shock.

3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The imbalances in electrolytes and fluids can affect various bodily functions, such as muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and kidney dysfunction.

4. Hypernatremia: The elevated sodium levels can lead to dehydration, neurological symptoms, and potentially life-threatening complications.

5. Alteration in nutrition: Malnutrition can weaken the immune system, impair wound healing, and increase the risk of infections and other complications.

6. Alcohol abuse: A history of alcohol abuse may contribute to poor wound healing, increased risk of infections, and other organ dysfunctions.

It is crucial to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to ensure the patient's well-being and improve their chances of recovery."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia.
- She was found unresponsive at home on [**2169-3-7**] and subsequently underwent intubation.
- The patient has been experiencing fever, with a temperature of 102.4 this morning. Her WBC count is between 5.9 and 9.7, indicating leukocytosis. The cause of the fever is unclear, but there may be a temporal relationship to the increase in tube feeds overnight, suggesting the possibility of aspiration.
- The patient has hypotension, which is likely related to sedation. Pressures improved when fentanyl and midazolam were stopped.
- The patient has a history of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and is currently being treated with cefepime and vancomycin for 8 days. Her respiratory status is stable.
- The patient has severe tracheobronchial malacia, and a plan has been made for tracheostomy today by surgery and IP with bypass.
- The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but currently does not have any active issues related to it.
- The patient is experiencing agitation and is being treated with seroquel and bupropion.
- The patient's nutrition is being managed through tube feeds ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home on [**2169-3-7**]. She underwent intubation and was transferred to the ICU. The patient has been receiving various treatments including tracheostomy, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and nutrition support. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a reduced sedation level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status remains poor despite reduction in sedation, indicating ongoing delirium or confusion.
2. Tracheobronchial Malacia: The patient has severe tracheobronchial malacia, which may lead to airway obstruction and respiratory compromise.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which can be potentially dangerous and requires careful management.
5. Agitation: The patient has been agitated and required medication intervention to control her agitation.
6. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is receiving empirical antibiotics for VAP.
7. Malnutrition: The patient is at risk of malnutrition due to her critical illness and inability to eat normally. She has undergone PEG for nutritional support.

- The patient has a history of tracheobronchial malacia and was found unresponsive at home. She underwent intubation and was transferred to the ICU.
- She has been experiencing fever and leukocytosis, but is currently afebrile with normalized WBC count.
- The patient has severe tracheobronchial malacia and had a tracheostomy placed. She was unable to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) due to agitation.
- She recently had a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement and started receiving tube feeding through the PEG.
- Her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently stable, and she is receiving nebulizer treatments as needed.
- The patient has been agitated and is being managed with various medications. An MRI of the head is planned.
- She has hypernatremia, which is being addressed by providing D5W maintenance fluids and NG tube free water boluses.
- The patient has a history of alcoholism and is receiving daily thiamine and folic acid supplementation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently underwent intubation. She has been transferred to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/53 to 157/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving various medications including propofol, haloperidol, hydromorphone, vecuronium, adenosine, diltiazem, and heparin sodium.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 5.3 to 9.7 thousand/mm³, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and normal kidney function. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for a slightly elevated sodium level of 136 mg/dL. 

The patient has several medical complications including fever and leukocytosis, severe tracheobronchial malacia, hypernatremia, COPD, agitation, and delirium. The plan includes further evaluation for VAP, attempting spontaneous breathing trials when the patient is calm, providing nutrition through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, managing hypernatremia with D5W and monitoring electrolytes, and conducting an MRI and EEG to investigate the cause of the patient's unresponsiveness.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further complications related to the patient's tracheobronchial malacia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently underwent intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions and complications. Here is a summary of the information in the note and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure/Tracheomalacia: The patient has severe tracheobronchial malacia and was intubated due to respiratory failure. She is unable to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) due to agitation and continues to be treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for VAP, indicating an existing lung infection. This increases the risk of further respiratory complications and antibiotic resistance.

3. Left Arm Swelling: The patient has left arm swelling, which could be indicative of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or other circulatory issues. This may lead to potential complications such as pulmonary embolism (PE).

4. Mental Status Change: The patient is experiencing confusion and agitation, which can be caused by various factors including sepsis, medication side effects, or neurologic dysfunction.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation, resulting in rapid ventricular response (RVR). This condition requires management to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She was transferred to the ICU and diagnosed with severe tracheobronchial malacia. The patient has been treated for respiratory failure, VAP, and atrial fibrillation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing agitation, hypernatremia, and delirium. The patient also has a history of alcohol abuse and COPD. An MRI of the head, EEG, and CT angiography of the chest are planned to further evaluate her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe tracheobronchial malacia may lead to ongoing respiratory failure if the tracheostomy tube becomes blocked or dislodged, or if there is an infection in the lower respiratory tract.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. This can be caused by aspiration of secretions or infection spread from the upper airways.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's recent episode of atrial fibrillation needs to be closely monitored for any recurrence, which could lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels require careful monitoring, especially"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently underwent intubation. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure due to severe tracheobronchial malacia and has been placed on a tracheostomy tube.

The patient also has altered mental status, which is suspected to be due to possible seizure activity as indicated by the EEG findings. The patient is currently being monitored on a 24-hour EEG. The preliminary results of the LP are negative for infection, and an MRI did not show evidence of stroke, frank anoxic injury, or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, but it has resolved with diltiazem. The patient does not require anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation but will be anticoagulated for deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) due to the presence of extensive DVT surrounding the PICC line.

Other issues include leukocytosis, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia, alteration in nutrition, and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is also being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is receiving TPN until she reaches goal tube feeds.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of further DVTs, persistent altered mental status,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to severe tracheobronchial malacia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has altered mental status and agitation, with possible seizure activity observed on EEG. 

The patient underwent a lumbar puncture, which was negative for infection. An MRI showed no evidence of stroke, frank anoxic injury, or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. She has been started on maintenance dilantin and sedation has been weaned off. The patient's atrial fibrillation has resolved, and she will continue to receive anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to her inability to tolerate enteral feeds, and her sodium levels need to be monitored. She has a history of COPD, but currently, there are no active issues related to it. Nebulizers are being used as needed for respiratory support. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypernatremia, and further episodes of seizures or delirium. It is important to closely monitor the patient's electrolyte balance, particularly sodium levels, while on TPN."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently underwent intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and severe tracheobronchial malacia. She has been diagnosed with altered mental status, agitation, leukocytosis, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia, alteration in nutrition, and tracheobronchomalacia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying tracheobronchial malacia has led to respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition. If not managed properly, it may result in further respiratory distress or the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Seizure activity: The patient had evidence of possible seizure activity on EEG, which requires close monitoring. If left untreated, seizures can lead to brain damage or other complications.

3. Delirium/confusion: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may indicate delirium or confusion. If not addressed, these symptoms can increase the risk of falls, self-injury, or worsening mental status.

4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia, indicating an imbalance in sodium levels. If not corrected, this can lead to dehydration, neurological complications, or even cardiac arrhythmias.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by severe tracheobronchial malacia. She has been experiencing altered mental status, agitation, possible seizure activity, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and anemia. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is receiving various medications including sedatives, anticonvulsants, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. She is also being given total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period of time.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT, which is a potential complication of prolonged immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Seizure activity: The patient's EEG showed possible seizure activity, indicating a risk for further seizures.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Although the patient's atrial fibrillation has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's ability to eat orally is compromised due to her tracheobronchial malacia, and she is dependent on TPN and tube feeds, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She was transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure and severe tracheobronchial malacia. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, agitation, possible seizure activity, atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, and leukocytosis. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. She is also receiving IV antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying tracheobronchial malacia. Close monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's EEG has shown evidence of possible seizure activity. It is important to monitor her neurological status and follow up with neurorecs for further evaluation and management.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may indicate delirium. Proper sedation and pain management should be continued, and delirium-specific interventions should be considered.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation, which resolved with diltiazem. Monitoring for recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) are necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, pain control (acute and chronic pain), leukocytosis, hypotension (not in shock), electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia (high sodium), alteration in nutrition, history of alcohol abuse, tracheobronchomalacia (tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia), and delirium/confusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's tracheobronchial malacia increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient already has a confirmed DVT in the upper extremity, and immobilization or bed rest in the ICU can increase the risk of developing more DVTs.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): A DVT can potentially dislodge and travel to the lungs, causing a PE. This is especially concerning if the patient develops any symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain.
4. Pressure ulcers: Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, particularly if the patient is not regularly repositioned.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure/severe tracheobronchial malacia, agitated delirium, seizure activity, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Severe Tracheobronchial Malacia: The patient's condition requires respiratory support, and there are ongoing issues with secretions and cough leak. Treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is being continued.
2. Agitated Delirium: The patient is experiencing agitated delirium, and psychotropic medications are being used for management. Sedation is being held to assess mental status and potentially wean from ventilatory support.
3. Seizure Activity: The patient has ongoing seizure activity, and Dilantin is being administered to manage it. Neurological recommendations need to be followed up.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and Diltiazem is being used for rate control. She is on IV heparin for DVT and will transition to Coumadin if there are no plans for future interventional procedures.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient has DVT, and"

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including altered mental status (not delirium), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, pain control (acute and chronic pain), leukocytosis, hypotension (not in shock), electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia (high sodium), alteration in nutrition, history of alcohol abuse, tracheobronchomalacia (tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia), and delirium/confusion.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 107/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including heparin sodium, pantoprazole (Protonix), haloperidol, dilantin, diltiazem, and meropenem.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, slightly elevated platelet count, normal creatinine levels, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for respiratory failure/severe tracheobronchial malacia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of depression, COPD, and tracheobronchomalacia who presents with respiratory failure after undergoing a tracheostomy. She has been diagnosed with anoxic brain injury and is experiencing ICU psychosis. Her mental status has shown some improvement with the use of antipsychotics. The patient's nutrition is complicated by coughing and emesis, and there are concerns about advancing her PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube. She has a persistent left lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and atrial fibrillation. She is currently receiving aggressive pulmonary toilet, TPN (total parenteral nutrition), and various medications to manage her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and adherence to VAP prevention protocols, such as maintaining head-of-bed elevation, performing daily mouth care, and assessing readiness for spontaneous breathing, are crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and anticoagulation therapy increase her risk for developing DVT. Regular assessment of her lower extremities for signs of swelling, redness, or warmth is essential. Additionally, ensuring proper positioning and use of compression stockings can help reduce"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of depression, COPD, and tracheobronchomalacia who presents with respiratory failure after undergoing a y stent placement. She has been diagnosed with ICU psychosis and baseline psych disorders. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has shown some improvement in mental status with the use of antipsychotics. She is also receiving TPN, glycopyrrolate for coughing/secretions, antibiotics for pneumonia, lovenox and coumadin for anticoagulation, dilantin for seizures, and diltiazem for atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ICU psychosis: The patient may continue to experience symptoms of ICU psychosis, such as hallucinations or delusions.
2. Respiratory failure: There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying conditions and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other infections due to the invasive nature of her treatment.
4. Bleeding: Anticoagulation therapy increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Seizures: The patient may be at risk for recurrent seizures, especially if there is evidence of ongoing brain injury.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and it is important to monitor for any cardiac rhythm disturbances.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of depression, COPD, and tracheobronchomalacia. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has undergone y stent placement. The patient's mental status has shown some improvement with the use of antipsychotics, but there is a concern for anoxic brain injury and potential ICU psychosis or underlying psych disorders.

The patient is receiving TPN (total parenteral nutrition) and a PICC (peripheral inserted central catheter) consult has been made. Glycopyrrolate has been started to manage coughing and oral secretions, and aggressive pulmonary toilet is being continued. A repeat bronchoscopic evaluation is planned to assess secretions, and there may be a need for GI (gastrointestinal) evaluation regarding loose brown blood-tinged emesis.

The patient's pneumonia is slowly resolving, and a repeat sputum culture/BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) will be done. The patient's anticoagulation therapy will be switched to lovenox and coumadin. There are concerns about seizure activity, so dilantin will be continued, and a neurology follow-up is scheduled.

The patient had a resolved episode of atrial fibrillation, and she will continue to be on A/C (anticoagulation) for deep vein thrombosis. Diltiazem will be continued until the patient is medically stable"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently underwent intubation. She has been in the ICU since then. The patient's current chief complaint is agitation and delirium. She has been agitated and delirious, but her condition is improving. She is now tracking and following commands. She is being given haloperidol (Haldol) every 12 hours and 5 mg at bedtime for sedation. Propofol sedation is being held.

The patient has been tolerating a very low rate of tube feeding (TF). It is recommended to discuss making the gastric tube post pyloric with either the gastroenterology (GI) or interventional radiology (IR) team. Nutrition should be talked to about concentrating TF and continuing total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for now. The goal is to titrate up TF to goal as tolerated.

The patient has been on antiepileptic drugs (dilantin) and has been therapeutic. An outpatient follow-up with neurology is needed after this hospital course.

The patient has had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on the last day of antibiotics (Vanc/Meropenem). Another sputum culture should be sent.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation and is on diltiazem. She is on IV heparin for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and subsequently underwent intubation. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Coffee-ground emesis: The patient had a single episode of coffee-ground emesis yesterday, which responded to a transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (pRBC). An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been planned to further evaluate this issue.

2. Agitated delirium: The patient has shown improvement in her agitation and delirium. She is now tracking and following commands. Her psychosocial recommendations should be appreciated, and she will continue to receive 5 mg of haloperidol every 12 hours (PRN) and at bedtime. Propofol sedation will be withheld.

3. Nutrition: The patient's gastric tube has been converted to a post-pyloric feeding to minimize regurgitation due to excessive coughing. The goal is to concentrate the tube feeding and continue total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for now. The patient's nutrition will be titrated up to the goal as tolerated.

4. Sz Activity: The patient is currently on dilantin, which has been therapeutic. She requires an outpatient follow-up with neurology after this hospital course.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD, bipolar disorder, tracheobronchomalacia, and recent pneumonia with respiratory failure. She underwent a Y stent procedure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's main issues include respiratory failure, mental status changes, gastrointestinal bleeding, seizure activity, atrial fibrillation, and an upper extremity clot. She is receiving various treatments and medications to address these conditions. The patient's overall condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure due to pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress or the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has unstable vital signs and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. There is a risk of continued bleeding, development of an ulcer, or perforation.
3. Seizure Activity: The patient has seizure activity, which may be due to electrolyte imbalances or other underlying causes. There is a risk of recurrent seizures or status epilepticus.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolism.
5. Upper Extremity Clot: The patient has a clot in the upper extremity, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if it dislodges.
6. Mental Status Changes: The patient is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has several medical conditions and complications.

The patient has erosive esophagitis and fundic and antral gastritis seen on EGD. She is on pantoprazole (Protonix) to manage these conditions. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows sinus tachycardia, and her blood pressure is within normal range. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with FiO2 at 50% and PEEP at 8 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Her electrolytes and kidney function are within normal limits. The patient is on multiple medications, including warfarin, lovenox, haldol, and others.

The patient's medical conditions include tracheobronchial malacia, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and COPD. The plan includes monitoring her Hct levels daily, titrating tube feeds to goal, continuing TPN until TF at goal rate, maintaining sleep-wake cycle, and providing ongoing neuro follow-up.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

   assessment above.
   Ms [**Known lastname 510**] was able to TM for nearly 5 hrs yesterday after completion of
   her EGD. This did not show signs of active bleeding. Oral secretions
   are still a problem but has not precluded wean.
   She is drowsy today and low grade febrile. We plan on restarting
   anticoagulation for UE clot and continuing high dose PPI for now.
   She will attempt to wean as tolerated provided she is more alert.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia.
- She was found unresponsive at home and intubated.
- She has been in the ICU with multiple medical complications.
- She has altered mental status, fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia, and tracheobronchomalacia.
- She is currently on multiple medications including anticoagulants, antibiotics, and anti-seizure medication.
- Her current condition is stable but she still requires close monitoring and management of her various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an upper extremity DVT, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism if not managed properly.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, indicating delirium. If not managed appropriately, this can progress to worsening confusion and potentially lead to long-term cognitive impairment.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on ventilatory support, and weaning from the ventilator may be challenging due to her tracheobronchomalacia. Failure to wean could result in prolonged mechanical ventilation and associated complications.
4. Gastritis/Esophagitis: The patient has been prescribed a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastritis/esophag"

   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status. The 24-hour events include advancing tube feeds throughout the day and obtaining a sputum culture. The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa. The last doses of antibiotics were meropenem and vancomycin on 4/10/2169. The patient is currently receiving various infusions and medications, including pantoprazole, Coumadin, and enoxaparin. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), current temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 109 bpm with a range of 91-109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/54 mmHg to 155/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute with a range of 13-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 74 kg, down from the admission weight of 80.8 kg. The patient's height is 66 inches.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,612 mL and total output of 2,340 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 272 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, spontaneous Vt of 378 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 142. The patient's partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) is 26 mmHg, arterial blood gas (ABG) is 142, and venous exchangerate (Ve) is 6.6 L/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals several abnormalities, including a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 4.9 to 9.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 22.8 to 30.4%, and platelet (Plt) count ranging from 168 to 191 K/uL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 38 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) is 1.0 mg/dL, and glucose is 136 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels show a sodium level of 139 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.7 mEq/L, chloride level of 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 30.4%, and magnesium level of 2.3 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pain control, leukocytosis, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia, alteration in nutrition, alcohol abuse, tracheobronchomalacia, delirium, and confusion. The patient is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids and Vivonex. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient has a history of DVT, which is a potential complication associated with immobility and blood clot formation in the veins.
2. Leukocytosis - The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating an infection or inflammatory response.
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder - The patient's electrolyte levels and fluid balance indicate potential imbalances that may require correction.
4. Hypernatremia - The patient's sodium level is elevated, indicating a risk for dehydration or excessive intake of sodium.
5. Tracheobronchomalacia - The patient has a history of tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia, which can lead to airway collapse and breathing difficulties.
6. Delirium and confusion - The patient's altered mental status suggests the possibility of delirium or confusion, which can be caused by various factors such as medication side effects, infection, or other underlying conditions.
7. Alcohol abuse - The patient's history of alcohol abuse may contribute to their current health issues and increase the risk of further complications.

It is important to note that the patient's condition should be closely monitored and managed by a healthcare professional to prevent and address any potential complications."

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and worsening respiratory status may indicate an infection.

2. Tracheostomy-related complications: The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place, which carries the risk of infection, bleeding, or displacement.

3. Pressure injuries: The patient's prolonged immobility and decreased nutritional status increase the risk of developing pressure injuries, particularly in areas subjected to constant pressure.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's prolonged immobility and use of central venous lines increase the risk of developing DVT. Anticoagulation therapy is being administered to prevent this complication.

5. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, including urinary tract infections, central line-associated bloodstream infections, or surgical site infections.

6. Delirium or encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes and inability to provide a medical history suggest the possibility of delirium or encephalopathy, which can be caused by various factors such as sepsis, medication side effects, or metabolic disturbances.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia, pneumonia, and prolonged mechanical ventilation. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fevers, gastritis/esophagitis, respiratory failure, mental status changes, seizures, atrial fibrillation, and upper extremity clots. She has been receiving various medications and treatments including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, and nutritional support through TPN and enteral feeding. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 125/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV mode, and a respiratory system compliance of 142. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent cultures of respiratory secretions should be done.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has upper extremity clots, indicating a risk for DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses, color, and temperature of the extremities, as well as performing regular ultrasound examinations, is necessary.
3. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizures, and there is a possibility of recurrence due"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical complications. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is experiencing symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, altered mental status, impaired balance and motor function, impaired ventilation, and leukocytosis. The patient also has a right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, which could indicate pneumonia. Additionally, the patient has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, pain control issues, hypernatremia, and electrolyte/fluid disorder.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 125/58 to 154/85 mmHg, heart rate between 89-112 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in kidney function and electrolyte levels.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including meropenem for infection, pantoprazole for acid reflux, enoxaparin for DVT prevention, and others. The patient is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutrition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications. These include fever, vomiting, reflux, respiratory failure, agitated delirium, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), COPD, anemia, and alcohol abuse. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem and has been advanced to goal tube feeds. She is also on various medications for her other conditions, including anticoagulation with enoxaparin and warfarin due to the presence of bilateral upper extremity clots. The patient's mental status is still poor but improving, and she is being managed with haloperidol for agitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever and new right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest an ongoing infection. The current treatment with meropenem is appropriate, but close monitoring of the patient's response to antibiotics is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has bilateral upper extremity clots, which make peripheral intravenous access (PIV) difficult. She is on enoxaparin and warfarin for anticoagulation, and the plan is to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include fever with no clear source, oral secretions that appear to be saliva and bilious, gastritis/esophagitis, respiratory failure, agitated delirium, poor mental status, agitation, and delirium. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, DVT, COPD, anemia, and alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's mental status is impaired, and she is inattentive and not following commands. She is currently on haloperidol (Haldol) to manage her agitation and delirium. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is attempting to be weaned from the ventilator, and a tracheal collar is being tried daily. It is important to closely monitor her respiratory function and adjust the ventilator settings as needed to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Gastritis/esophagitis: The patient has a history of gastritis/esophagitis, and it is being managed with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Monitoring her daily hematocrit levels is important in the setting of anticoagulation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications including fever, respiratory failure, agitation, delirium, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been treated for VAP with meropenem. It is important to continue monitoring for signs of infection and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is currently receiving lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. Regular monitoring for clot progression and potential embolism is essential.
3. Agitation and delirium: The patient's mental status is still poor but improving. Close observation and monitoring for any changes in mental status is necessary. Medication adjustment may be needed to manage agitation and delirium.
4. Tracheobronchial malacia: This pre-existing condition may contribute to respiratory complications. Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and ensuring proper tracheostomy care is crucial.
5. Gastritis/esophagitis: The patient is being treated for reflux and gastritis. Monitoring for any worsening symptoms and continuing proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is important.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's recent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been in the ICU since then. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including leukocytosis, choking on oral secretions, respiratory failure, agitated delirium, gastritis/esophagitis, atrial fibrillation, DVT, anemia, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for suspected VAP with meropenem. It is important to monitor her response to the antibiotic and watch for any signs of worsening lung infection.
2. Tracheobronchial malacia: The patient's pre-existing condition may contribute to her current respiratory issues. Close monitoring of her airway and respiratory function is necessary.
3. Gastritis/esophagitis: The patient is on proton pump inhibitors to manage her gastritis/esophagitis. Monitoring her symptoms and adjusting the medication if needed is important.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be closely monitored, and anticoagulation therapy should be managed appropriately.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis and will restart warfarin when no longer needing procedures. Regular monitoring of her coagulation status"

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 140/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 50%. 

The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and elevated glucose levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include several conditions:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient is being treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem, despite negative central line-associated bloodstream infection cultures.
2. Choking on oral secretions: The patient has pharyngeal muscle weakness and will need intensive rehabilitation. The scope patch should be continued, and the removal of the tracheal stent should be discussed with the intensivist.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient will likely require long-term weaning from mechanical ventilation. Haldol is being administered to manage myoclonic jer"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia who initially presented with respiratory failure. She underwent Y stent placement and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications, including leukocytosis, respiratory failure, gastritis/esophagitis, delirium, feeding intolerance, muscle weakness, seizure activity, atrial fibrillation, and access issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's leukocytosis and lack of new fevers suggest a possible infection. VAP is a potential complication due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Removal of tracheostomy stent: The patient's inability to protect her lower respiratory tract from oral secretions may require removal of the stent to achieve adequate cuff occlusion. This procedure carries the risk of airway compromise.
3. Gastritis/esophagitis: The patient's stable hematocrit indicates that her gastritis/esophagitis is currently stable. However, if not managed appropriately, this condition can lead to further complications such as ulceration and bleeding.
4. Delirium: Although the patient's delirium is improving, it remains a concern. Delirium in critically ill patients can be associated with increased mortality and prolonged ICU stay.
5. Feeding intolerance: The patient's regurgitation of stomach and oral secretions may indicate feeding intolerance. If not"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and subsequently underwent intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently elevated, indicating tachycardia. This could be due to various factors such as stress, pain, fever, or an underlying cardiac condition.

2. Arousal, attention, and cognition impaired: The patient exhibits impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, suggesting delirium or altered mental status. This may be caused by medications, infection, or other underlying medical conditions.

3. Balance impaired: The patient has impaired balance, which could be related to neurological issues or muscle weakness.

4. Transfers impaired: The patient's ability to transfer from one position to another is impaired, which can be attributed to muscle weakness or neurological deficits.

5. Motor function impaired: The patient has impaired motor function, likely due to muscle weakness or neurological damage.

6. Ventilation impaired: The patient's ventilation is impaired, possibly due to tracheobronchial malacia or complications from mechanical ventilation.

7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT in the upper extremity. This condition increases the risk of pulmonary embolism and should be monitored closely.

8. Pain control: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 yo F with obesity, tracheobronchomalacia, here with respiratory
   failure now s/p Y-stent placement
   1. Respiratory failure: TBM s/p Y stent, now with copious oral
   secretion and air leak around cuff
    - would consider changing out trach for [**Last Name (un) **] with water seal to
   achieve greater cuff occlusion
    - if above is unsuccessful, she may need stent removal
    - with TBM will likely have intermittent + pressure dependence but
   currently tolerating TCM
    - trial mucomyst and albuterol to mobilize thick lower respiratory
   tract secretions
   2. Leukocytosis and low-grade temps: likely [**2-14**] VAP with infiltrate on
   cxr
    - cont meropenem x 10 days
    - persistent aspiration of oral secretions could also contribute
   3. Mental status: much improved
    - cont haldol qhs
   4. Access: poor peripheral access
    - will d/w surgery re port-a-cath for permanent access given clots in

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with obesity, tracheobronchomalacia, and respiratory failure who has undergone Y-stent placement. The patient is currently experiencing copious oral secretions and an air leak around the tracheostomy tube cuff. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to tracheobronchomalacia and the presence of copious oral secretions and air leak around the tracheostomy tube cuff. If the tracheostomy tube is not changed to a water seal with greater cuff occlusion, or if stent removal is unsuccessful, the patient may experience further respiratory compromise.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has leukocytosis and low-grade temperatures, which are suggestive of VAP. The infiltrate seen on chest X-ray also supports this diagnosis. Continued administration of meropenem for 10 days is planned to treat the suspected VAP.

3. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status has improved, but there is a need to continue haloperidol at bedtime to manage any potential psychiatric symptoms.

4. Poor peripheral access: The patient has poor peripheral access, making it difficult to obtain intravenous access. A port-a-cath is being considered for permanent access due to clots in the upper extremities.

5. Upper extremity clots: The patient has clots in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with obesity, tracheobronchomalacia, and recent Y-stent placement. She is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure due to tracheobronchomalacia and copious oral secretions with an air leak around the cuff. The patient's recent history includes failed Y stent, tracheostomy, and possible aspiration of oral secretions. She has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. She was last given meropenem on 04/16/2016 at 10:05 AM. The patient is receiving multiple medications including colace, chlorhexadine, Robitussin, pantoprazole, folic acid, haldol, meropenem, and reglan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tracheobronchomalacia and air leak around the cuff pose a risk for ongoing respiratory failure. The tracheostomy may need to be changed, and the Y stent may need to be removed if the current management fails.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has leukocytosis and low-grade temperatures, suggesting a possible infection. There is also an infiltrate on her chest X-ray, which could indicate VAP. Continuing meropenem for 10 days and addressing aspiration of oral secretions are part of the management plan.

","Summary:
The patient is currently unresponsive and admitted to the ICU. They have a history of alcohol abuse and are experiencing various medical complications. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen, and has a tracheostomy tube in place. Their vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/58 mmHg to 159/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including enoxaparin (Lovenox), pantoprazole (Protonix), and other ICU medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
2. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia, which can lead to airway collapse during positive pressure ventilation. Monitoring for signs of airway compromise is essential.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has altered mental status, but it is not delirium. Delirium should be considered and managed appropriately if symptoms worsen.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia (high"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia was
   transferred from [**State 507**] after being found unresponsive at home on
   [**2169-3-7**] and subsequently undergoing intubation.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Only low grade temps in last 24h, WBC slightly up today.
   Treating for suspected VAP with meropenem day 1 [**4-13**] plan for 10 day
   course. Cxs remain negative.
   Other potential sources include line,
   -f/u blood cultures, culture if spikes
   -send off blood cxs
   -repeat CXR, repeat UA/UCX, stool for C diff
   .
   # Abdominal pain
   Belly soft.  Could be due to known gastritis/esophagitis
 no ulcers on
   recent EGD. Given broad spectrum abd would consider C diff, though she
   has not had large stool output.
   - Will defer imaging for now, low threshold for CT if pain worsens
   - Add on LFTs, lipase
   - Checking C diff as above, urine studies
   .
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   --discuss ways of improving trach occlusion with IP, this may mean
   removing stent
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Will likely require long term weaning
   --continue haldol 2mg IV q2 hrs prn and 5mg IV qhs as needed for MS
   [**Name13 (STitle) 12365**] of secretions as per above
   ..
   # Gastritis/Esophagitis:
   -cont [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV for now
   -Monitor daily Hct in setting of anticoagulation
   - Maintain active T+S.
   .
   # Agitated Delirium:
   H/o EtoH abuse but well outside the window of DTs at this time. Mental
   status currently improved. Following commands.
   Prolongued ICU stay, infection, electrolyte disturbances may be
   contributory.
   - Cont Haldol qHS and PRN
   - Follow QTc with daily EKG
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   Free H20 deficit is ~2L
   - Free H20 with TFs
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Nutrition:
   -- TF continuous 24 hours
   -- TPN discontinued.
   # Sz Activity:
   No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have discontinued phenytoin.
   --needs outpt f/u with neuro after this hospital course
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus
   --cont diltiazem
   --continue lovenox, hold warfarin for now in case of procedure
   .
   # DVT:
   -- lovenox
   -- restart warfarin when no longer needing procedures
   .
    # COPD: no active issues
   - cont inhalers

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been in the ICU since [**2169-3-7**] and is currently on mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including leukocytosis, abdominal pain, oropharyngeal dysphagia, respiratory failure, gastritis/esophagitis, agitated delirium, hypernatremia, nutrition issues, seizure activity, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), proton pump inhibitors for stress ulcer prophylaxis, low molecular weight heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and nutritional support through enteral feeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for suspected VAP with meropenem. However, there is a risk of developing this complication due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient's abdominal pain and recent antibiotic use increase the risk of developing C. difficile infection. Stool for C. difficile should be checked.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving low molecular"

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient tolerated tracheostomy collar until 7 p.m. and then required restarting on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to becoming tachypneic with low tidal volume on tracheostomy collar.
- Neurologic examination is okay to discontinue dilantin as the level is 1.0, with no definitive evidence of seizures and mental status is clearer than previously.
- The patient complains of intermittent sharp abdominal pains in the last day, along with nausea.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- Vital signs show sinus tachycardia, mild tachypnea, and stable blood pressure.
- The patient's weight has decreased from 80.8 kg at admission to 70.5 kg currently.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 1642 mL and output of 1060 mL, resulting in a balance of 582 mL.
- Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with an FiO2 of 50%.
- Physical examination reveals mild lung congestion, heart sounds difficult to hear due to noisy breathing, and mild left-sided abdominal tenderness.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and subsequently underwent intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions and complications.

1. Unresponsiveness: The patient was found unresponsive at home, and her mental status has been improved with treatment. The cause of her initial unresponsiveness is still unknown.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown signs of leukocytosis, and there is suspicion of VAP. She is being treated with meropenem, and cultures remain negative. Further investigations are planned to identify other potential sources of infection.

3. Oropharyngeal dysphagia: A swallowing evaluation indicated pharyngeal muscle weakness. The patient will require intensive rehabilitation to improve her ability to swallow. A scop patch is being continued, and ways to improve tracheostomy occlusion will be discussed with the interprofessional team, possibly involving the removal of the stent.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient will likely require long-term weaning from mechanical ventilation. She is currently on continuous haloperidol for agitation and delirium, which may contribute to her prolonged ICU stay.

5. Access: The patient needs a consultation for a permanent catheter placement due to ongoing need for central access.

6. Gastritis/esophagitis: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and underwent intubation. She has been in the ICU since then. The patient's chief complaint is being unresponsive. 

24-hour events include tolerating a tracheostomy collar until 7 p.m. and then restarting on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to tachypnea with low tidal volume on the tracheostomy collar. The patient's mental status has improved, and there is no definitive evidence of seizures. 

Allergies include penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa. The last dose of antibiotics was meropenem at 4:00 AM on 04/17/2169. 

The patient is currently on various infusions, including enoxaparin (Lovenox) started on 04/16/2169 at 8:00 PM and pantoprazole (Protonix) started on 04/16/2169 at 11:45 PM. 

Other medications include changes to medical and family history, review of systems unchanged from admission except as noted below, and flowsheet data as of 04/17/2169 at 06:56 AM. 

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), current temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F),"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been in the ICU since March 7th, 2169. The patient's current complaints include intermittent sharp abdominal pains and nausea. She has been treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem, but her sputum cultures have remained negative. Other potential sources of infection include lines, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's abdominal pain may be due to known gastritis/esophagitis, and she is being evaluated for possible C. diff infection. She also has oropharyngeal dysphagia, which requires intensive rehabilitation, and respiratory failure that will likely require long-term weaning from the ventilator. The patient has a history of ethanol abuse, but her mental status is currently improved. She has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of approximately 2 liters and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and tube feeds (TFs). Her seizure activity has been monitored, and she has been discontinued from phenytoin. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anemia, and is currently on various medications and treatments.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently underwent intubation. She has been in the ICU since then.

24-hour events include tolerating a tracheostomy collar until 7 p.m., then restarting on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to tachypnea with low tidal volume on the tracheostomy collar. The patient's mental status has improved, and dilantin was discontinued as there was no evidence of seizures.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. Her last dose of antibiotics was meropenem on [**2169-4-17**] at 4:00 a.m.

The patient is receiving various infusions and medications, including enoxaparin (Lovenox), pantoprazole (Protonix), and other ICU medications.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the following:

- The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/58 mmHg to 159/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.
- The patient's weight has decreased from 80.8 kg at admission to 70.5 kg currently.
- Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1642 mL and output of 1060 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 582 mL.
- Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through the tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, and supplemental oxygen at 50%.

Physical examination findings include sinus tachycardia, but no other significant findings were assessed due to the patient's unresponsiveness.

Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan include the following:

- Leukocytosis: The patient has been treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem, and blood cultures have remained negative.
- Oropharyngeal dysphagia: The patient has pharyngeal muscle weakness, and intensive rehabilitation is recommended. The scop patch will continue, and ways to improve tracheostomy occlusion will be discussed with the interdisciplinary team.
- Respiratory failure: The patient may require long-term weaning from the ventilator. Haldol will be continued for agitation and delirium, and the QTc interval will be monitored with daily EKGs.
- Access: A consultation with a gen surgeon is needed for a permanent catheter placement.
- Gastritis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of obesity, COPD, GERD, and tracheobronchomalacia who has undergone Y stent placement. She is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. She has been experiencing fluctuations in mental status, hypernatremia, elevated WBC count with new abdominal pain, rise in liver function tests, hypernatremia, and respiratory failure. She also has upper extremity clots and lower blood pressure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status is waxing and waning, and she is currently less responsive. This could be due to various factors such as infection, medication side effects, or electrolyte imbalances. Further evaluation, including checking ABG and addressing hypernatremia, is needed.
2. Elevated WBC count with new abdominal pain: The rise in WBC count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammation, possibly in the abdominal region. This needs further investigation, including checking for RUQUS and CDif.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient is hypernatremic, which can lead to severe dehydration, altered mental status, and other complications. It needs to be corrected promptly.
4. Upper extremity clots: The patient has lower extremity edema, which could indicate the presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The use of Lovenox can help prevent further clot formation.

   1.  Mental status: waxes and wanes, currently less responsive this
   morning, received addl haldol overnight, now hypernatremic
    - will d/c haldol
    - will check ABG
    - will continue to monitor
    - fix hypernatremia
   2. Elevated WBC, now with new abdominal pain, rise in LFTs
    - will check RUQUS
    - will check CDiff
   3. Hypernatremia: increase FWB
   4. Upper extremity clots: lovenox
   5. Respiratory failure: intermittent vent dependence
    - trach in place currently with air leak
    - will discuss further options with IP: ? change out trach vs remove
   Y-stent
   6. Lower blood pressure this morning:
    - appears dehydrated, will give IVF bolus

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of obesity, COPD, GERD, and tracheobronchomalacia who underwent Y-stent placement.
- She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and has been experiencing mental status changes, hypernatremia, elevated WBC count, new abdominal pain, and a rise in liver function tests.
- The patient also has upper extremity clots and intermittent vent dependence.
- There are concerns about dehydration, lower blood pressure, and the need for further intervention regarding tracheostomy management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if the tracheostomy tube needs to be removed or if there are ongoing issues with air leaks.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may lead to severe dehydration and neurological complications if not corrected promptly.
3. Abdominal Pain and Elevated WBC Count: The combination of new abdominal pain and an elevated white blood cell count could indicate an infection or inflammation in the abdomen, potentially requiring further investigation and treatment.
4. Mental Status Changes: The patient's fluctuating mental status requires close monitoring, and any significant deterioration should be promptly addressed.
5. Upper Extremity Clots: The presence of clots in the upper extremities increases the risk of pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening if not treated appropriately.
6. Dehydration: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia was
   transferred from [**State 507**] after being found unresponsive at home on
   [**2169-3-7**] and subsequently undergoing intubation.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Only low grade temps in last 24h, WBC slightly improved
   Treating for suspected VAP with meropenem (d1= [**4-13**], today d6) plan for
   10 day course. Cxs remain negative.
   Other potential sources include line, cdiff, UTI
   - f/u pending micro, culture if spikes
   - send line tip culture when out
   .
   # Abdominal pain
   Pain improved, belly soft.  Could be due to known gastritis/esophagitis
 no ulcers on recent EGD. C diff negative x2. CT abd without acute
   process.
   - follow up CT abd final read
   - serial exams, may give low dose morphine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis
   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to med effect
 eg diltiazem, reglan, lovenox, recent
   dilantin. Pattern not suggestive of obstructive process or alcoholic
   hepatitis. LFTs modestly improved today. No major liver pathology noted
   on CT, though limited by lack of contrast. Splenomegaly raises question
   of underlying portal hypertension from alcoholic liver disease.
   - continue to trend
   - check hepB/C serologies
   - limit acetaminophen to 2g/day
   .
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   --discuss ways of improving trach occlusion with IP, this may mean
   removing stent
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Will likely require long term weaning.
   --discuss with IP long term mgmt of trach
   --management of secretions as per above
   ..
   # Gastritis/Esophagitis:
   -cont [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV for now
   -Monitor daily Hct in setting of anticoagulation
   - Maintain active T+S.
   .
   # Agitated Delirium:
   H/o EtoH abuse but well outside the window of DTs at this time. Mental
   status currently improved. Following commands.
   Prolongued ICU stay, infection, electrolyte disturbances may be
   contributory.
   - d/c Haldol given depressed mental status
   - infectious workup as above
   - Follow QTc with daily EKG
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   Now improved following increased free H20 flushes and D5
   - Continue free H20 flushes, follow Na daily
   .
   # Nutrition:
   -- TF continuous 24 hours
   -- TPN discontinued.
   # Sz Activity:
   No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have discontinued phenytoin.
   --needs outpt f/u with neuro after this hospital course
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus
   --cont diltiazem
   --continue lovenox, hold warfarin for now in case of procedure
   .
   # DVT:
   -- lovenox
   -- restart warfarin when no longer needing procedures
   .
    # COPD: no active issues

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been in the ICU for an extended period and has developed several medical complications.

1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which indicates a possible infection. She is being treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem. Other potential sources of infection include catheter-related bloodstream infection, Clostridium difficile infection, and urinary tract infection.

2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain has improved, and her belly is soft. This may be due to known gastritis/esophagitis, but no ulcers were found on recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). She does not have Clostridium difficile infection. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed no acute process.

3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may be due to medication effects such as diltiazem, reglan, lovenox, or recent dilantin. The pattern of liver enzyme elevation does not suggest an obstructive process or alcoholic hepatitis. There is also a question of underlying portal hypertension from alcoholic liver disease, especially with the presence of splenomegaly.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was found unresponsive at home and intubated for respiratory failure. She is currently in the ICU being treated for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem. The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including leukocytosis, abdominal pain, transaminitis, oropharyngeal dysphagia, respiratory failure, gastritis/esophagitis, agitated delirium, hypernatremia, long-term access, nutrition, seizure activity, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or inflammation in the body. This could potentially lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. If left untreated, it could progress to a more serious condition such as peritonitis.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating potential liver dysfunction. Continued monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further liver damage.
4. Oropharyngeal Dysphagia: The patient has difficulty swallowing due to pharyngeal muscle"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia was
   transferred from [**State 507**] after being found unresponsive at home on
   [**2169-3-7**] and subsequently undergoing intubation.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Only low grade temps in last 24h, WBC slightly improved
   Treating for suspected VAP with meropenem day 1 [**4-13**] plan for 10 day
   course. Cxs remain negative.
   Other potential sources include line, cdiff, UTI
   -f/u blood cultures, culture if spikes
   -send off blood cxs
   -repeat CXR, repeat UA/UCX, stool for C diff
   .
   # Abdominal pain
   Belly soft.  Could be due to known gastritis/esophagitis
 no ulcers on
   recent EGD. Given broad spectrum abd would consider C diff, though she
   has not had large stool output.
   - check RUQ ultrasound given increased LFT
   - Add on LFTs, lipase
   - Checking C diff as above, urine studies
   .
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   --discuss ways of improving trach occlusion with IP, this may mean
   removing stent
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Will likely require long term weaning. On trach
   --discuss with IP long term mgmt of trach
   --management of secretions as per above
   ..
   # Gastritis/Esophagitis:
   -cont [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV for now
   -Monitor daily Hct in setting of anticoagulation
   - Maintain active T+S.
   .
   # Agitated Delirium:
   H/o EtoH abuse but well outside the window of DTs at this time. Mental
   status currently improved. Following commands.
   Prolongued ICU stay, infection, electrolyte disturbances may be
   contributory.
   - d/c Haldol given depressed mental status
   - infectious workup as above
   - Follow QTc with daily EKG
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   Now improved following increased free H20 flushes and D5
   - Continue free H20 flushes, follow Na daily
   .
   # Nutrition:
   -- TF continuous 24 hours
   -- TPN discontinued.
   # Sz Activity:
   No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have discontinued phenytoin.
   --needs outpt f/u with neuro after this hospital course
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus
   --cont diltiazem
   --continue lovenox, hold warfarin for now in case of procedure
   .
   # DVT:
   -- lovenox
   -- restart warfarin when no longer needing procedures
   .
    # COPD: no active issues
   - cont inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: Trending her hct. Transfuse hct>21.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia was
   transferred from [**State 507**] after being found unresponsive at home on
   [**2169-3-7**] and subsequently undergoing intubation.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Only low grade temps in last 24h, WBC slightly improved
   Treating for suspected VAP with meropenem day 1 [**4-13**] plan for 10 day
   course. Cxs remain negative.
   Other potential sources include line, cdiff, UTI
   -f/u blood cultures, culture if spikes
   -send off blood cxs
   -repeat CXR, repeat UA/UCX, stool for C diff
   .
   # Abdominal pain
   Belly soft.  Could be due to known gastritis/esophagitis
 no ulcers on
   recent EGD. Given broad spectrum abd would consider C diff, though she
   has not had large stool output.
   - check RUQ ultrasound given increased LFT
   - Add on LFTs, lipase
   - Checking C diff as above, urine studies
   .
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   --discuss ways of improving trach occlusion with IP, this may mean
   removing stent
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Will likely require long term weaning. On trach
   --discuss with IP long term mgmt of trach
   --management of secretions as per above
   ..
   # Gastritis/Esophagitis:
   -cont [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV for now
   -Monitor daily Hct in setting of anticoagulation
   - Maintain active T+S.
   .
   # Agitated Delirium:
   H/o EtoH abuse but well outside the window of DTs at this time. Mental
   status currently improved. Following commands.
   Prolongued ICU stay, infection, electrolyte disturbances may be
   contributory.
   - d/c Haldol given depressed mental status
   - infectious workup as above
   - Follow QTc with daily EKG
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   Now improved following increased free H20 flushes and D5
   - Continue free H20 flushes, follow Na daily
   .
   # Nutrition:
   -- TF continuous 24 hours
   -- TPN discontinued.
   # Sz Activity:
   No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have discontinued phenytoin.
   --needs outpt f/u with neuro after this hospital course

   -f/u blood cultures, culture if spikes
   -send off blood cxs
   -repeat CXR, repeat UA/UCX, stool for C diff
   .
   # Abdominal pain
   Belly soft.  Could be due to known gastritis/esophagitis
 no ulcers on
   recent EGD. Given broad spectrum abd would consider C diff, though she
   has not had large stool output.
   - check RUQ ultrasound given increased LFT
   - Add on LFTs, lipase
   - Checking C diff as above, urine studies
   .

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated. She has been admitted to the ICU and has several ongoing medical issues that require attention.

1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infection. She is being treated for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem. Other potential sources of infection include line-related infection, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and urinary tract infection (UTI). Further investigations are planned to identify the source of infection.

2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be related to known gastritis or esophagitis. No ulcers were found on recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been given, and additional tests such as liver function tests (LFTs), lipase, and stool studies for C. diff are needed. An abdominal ultrasound should also be considered due to increased LFT levels.

3. Oropharyngeal dysphagia: The patient has pharyngeal muscle weakness, which will require intensive rehabilitation. She should continue scop patch therapy and discuss ways of improving tracheostomy occlusion with the intensivist (IP). Removing the stent may be necessary for long-term management.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient will likely require long-term weaning from mechanical ventilation. She is currently on a tracheostomy and may need long-term management of tracheostomy. Strategies for managing secretions should be implemented as per above recommendations.

5. Gastritis/Esophagitis: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy should be continued IV for now. Daily monitoring of hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is important in the setting of anticoagulation. Maintaining active tissue perfusion and oxygenation should also be prioritized.

6. Agitated Delirium: The patient's mental status has improved, and she is following commands. This could be attributed to prolonged ICU stay, infection, or electrolyte disturbances. Further evaluation of infectious causes and electrolyte imbalances is necessary. Daily electrocardiogram (EKG) monitoring is recommended to follow the QTc interval.

7. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have improved following increased free water flushes and dextrose (D5) administration. Continuous free water flushes and daily monitoring of sodium levels should be continued.

8. Nutrition: Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) has been discontinued, and the patient will receive Vivonex (Full) at 65 mL/hour. 

9. Seizure activity: There have been no recent seizures, and phenytoin has been discontinued. An outpatient follow-up with neurology is recommended after this hospital course.

10. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation has resolved, and diltiazem should be continued. Lovenox and warfarin should be restarted when procedures are no longer needed.

11. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Lovenox and warfarin therapy should be continued for DVT management.

12. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): No active issues are present, and the patient should continue inhaler therapy.

13. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is trending downwards. If it falls below 21, transfusion may be necessary.

14. ICU care: The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition support with Vivonex, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. Her code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD and TBM (tuberculosis of the brain) who was admitted with respiratory failure. She underwent Y-stent placement and tracheostomy. The patient's current condition includes persistent oral and gastric secretions draining into the lungs around her trach cuff, transaminitis, abdominal pain, oral secretions, poor peripheral access for IV lines, gastritis/esophagitis, mental status changes, hypernatremia, and atrial fibrillation with paroxysmal atrial flutter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent oral and gastric secretions can lead to further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Continuous suctioning and proper tracheostomy care are crucial to prevent these complications.

2. Transaminitis and Abdominal Pain: The patient's elevated liver enzymes could indicate an ongoing liver inflammation or damage. It is important to identify the underlying cause, which could be medication-related. Monitoring liver function and checking hepatitis serologies would be appropriate.

3. Oral Secretions: The patient continues to have oral secretions, which can increase the risk of aspiration and respiratory infections. Scopolamine patch and continued oral suctioning should help manage this issue.

4. Access Issues: The patient has poor peripheral access and currently has a subclavian central venous line (CVL). A port"

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of COPD and tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She underwent Y-stent placement and tracheostomy. The patient tolerates tracheostomy mask better and requires less suctioning. Abdominal CT shows no evidence of intraabdominal process. The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa. She was on meropenem antibiotics until yesterday morning. The patient is currently receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, enoxaparin (Lovenox), pantoprazole (Protonix), and diltiazem. The patient has a history of hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, and paroxysmal atrial flutter. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count and platelets, as well as abnormal liver function tests. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 144/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Physical examination reveals thinness, tracheostomy, bilateral radial and dorsalis pedis pulses, no edema, muscle wasting, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status. The patient's disposition is in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia was
   transferred from [**State 507**] after being found unresponsive at home on
   [**2169-3-7**] and s/p intubation for respiratory failure, now on abx for
   presumed VAP.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Only low grade temps in last 24h, WBC improved
   Treating for suspected VAP versus tracheobronchitis with meropenem (d1=
   [**4-13**], today d7) plan for 10 day course. Cxs remain negative.
   Other potential sources include line, cdiff, UTI
 less likely
   - f/u pending micro, culture if spikes
   - send line tip culture when out
   .
   # Abdominal pain with n/v
   Pain improved, belly soft.  Could be due to known gastritis/esophagitis
 no ulcers on recent EGD. C diff negative x2. CT abd without acute
   process.
   - follow abdominal exam today
   .
   # Transaminitis
   Improved on serial tests
   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to med effect
 eg diltiazem, reglan, lovenox, recent
   dilantin. Pattern not suggestive of obstructive process or alcoholic
   hepatitis. LFTs modestly improved today. No major liver pathology noted
   on CT, though limited by lack of contrast. Splenomegaly raises question
   of underlying portal hypertension from alcoholic liver disease.
   - continue to trend
   - follow up  hepB/C serologies
   - limit acetaminophen to 2g/day
   .
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   -- continue reglan
   --discuss ways of improving trach occlusion with IP, this may mean
   removing stent
   -- can restart TF as regurgitation is oropharyngeal/gastric
   -- continue suctioning
   .
   # Anemia- check repeat CBC,  HD stable. Will trend if real value.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Will likely require long term weaning. Likely
   aspiration event last night.
   -- decrease PS today
   --discuss with IP long term mgmt of trach
   --management of secretions as per above
   ..
   # Gastritis/Esophagitis:   Hcts have been stable
   - protonix PO BID
   -Monitor daily Hct in setting of anticoagulation
   - Maintain active T+S.
   .
   # Agitated Delirium: Improved.
   H/o EtoH abuse but well outside the window of DTs at this time. Mental
   status currently improved. Following commands.
   Prolongued ICU stay, infection, electrolyte disturbances may be
   contributory.
   - infectious workup as above
   - can trial zydis prn agitation
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   Now improved following increased free H20 flushes and D5
   - Continue free H20 flushes, follow Na daily
   .
   # Sz Activity:
   No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have discontinued phenytoin.
   --needs outpt f/u with neuro after this hospital course
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus
   --cont diltiazem
   --continue lovenox, hold warfarin if HCT stable
   .
   # DVT:
   -- lovenox
   -- restart warfarin if HCT stable
   .
    # COPD: no active issues
   - cont inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: Trending her hct. Transfuse hct>21.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on day 7 of meropenem therapy for presumed VAP. It is important to monitor the patient's clinical response and follow up with cultures to determine if the treatment is effective.

2. Tracheobronchial malacia: The patient has a history of tracheobronchial malacia, which can lead to respiratory failure and increased risk of aspiration events. Long-term management of the tracheostomy and strategies to manage secretions should be discussed with the interdisciplinary team.

3. Gastritis/Esophagitis: The patient has known gastritis/esophagitis, and proton pump inhibitors have been prescribed. Monitoring daily hemoglobin concentrations in the setting of anticoagulation is essential.

4. Delirium: The patient has shown improvement in mental status, but prolonged ICU stay, infection, and electrolyte disturbances may be contributing factors. An infectious workup as previously mentioned should be continued.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have improved following increased free water flushes and D5 administration. Continuous monitoring of sodium levels is necessary.

6. Seizure activity: The patient has no recent seizures, and phenytoin has been discontinued. An outpatient follow-up with neurology after this hospital course is recommended.

7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in"

   dilantin. Pattern not suggestive of obstructive process or alcoholic
   hepatitis. LFTs modestly improved today. No major liver pathology noted
   on CT, though limited by lack of contrast. Splenomegaly raises question
   of underlying portal hypertension from alcoholic liver disease.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, who was found unresponsive at home and intubated for respiratory failure. She has been on antibiotics for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and remains negative for c diff and other infections. The patient has multiple medical complications including leukocytosis, abdominal pain with nausea, transaminitis, oropharyngeal dysphagia, anemia, respiratory failure, gastritis/esophagitis, agitated delirium, hypernatremia, seizure activity, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and anemia. The patient's current condition is stable, and the medical team plans to wean her off mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on antibiotics for presumed VAP, which is a common complication in patients on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.
2. Aspiration: The patient had a witnessed aspiration event last night, which can lead to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis, indicating an increased risk for blood clots in the legs.
4. Gastritis/esophagitis: The patient has been diagnosed with gastritis/esoph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She was transferred to the ICU after being found unresponsive at home and required intubation for respiratory failure. She is currently on antibiotics for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has several ongoing medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already being treated with antibiotics for presumed VAP. It is important to monitor her response to the treatment and check for any signs of infection or worsening respiratory status.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous lines. Prophylactic measures, such as low molecular weight heparin, should be continued.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has improved sodium levels following increased free water flushes and dextrose administration. Close monitoring of sodium levels is necessary to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests have modestly improved. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, and liver function should continue to be monitored.
5. Oropharyngeal dysphagia: The patient has pharyngeal muscle weakness, which may require intensive rehabilitation. Improving tracheostomy occlusion and discussing ways to manage secretions should be considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female who is currently in the ICU. She has a history of alcohol abuse and is sedated, unable to provide a history. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including tachycardia, altered mental status, impaired balance and motor function, impaired ventilation, and leukocytosis. She also has a history of deep venous thrombosis in the upper extremity, acute and chronic pain, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypernatremia, alteration in nutrition, and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but she is hypotensive. Her blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, platelets, and some abnormal liver function tests. She is receiving multiple medications and interventions in the ICU, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT in the upper extremity, which increases the risk of developing another DVT while in the ICU.
2. Pulmonary embolism: A potential complication of DVT is the dislodgement of the clot and subsequent travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism.
3. Sepsis:"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia was
   transferred from [**State 507**] after being found unresponsive at home on
   [**2169-3-7**] and s/p intubation for respiratory failure, now on abx for
   presumed VAP.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Only low grade temps in last 24h, WBC improved
   Treating for suspected VAP versus tracheobronchitis with meropenem (d1=
   [**4-13**], today d7) plan for 10 day course. Cxs remain negative.
   Other potential sources include line, cdiff, UTI
   - f/u pending micro, culture if spikes
   - send line tip culture when out
   .
   # Abdominal pain with n/v
   Pain improved, belly soft.  Could be due to known gastritis/esophagitis
 no ulcers on recent EGD. C diff negative x2. CT abd without acute
   process.
   - follow up CT abd final read
   - serial exams, may give low dose morphine as needed
   .
   # Transaminitis
   Improved on serial tests
   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to med effect
 eg diltiazem, reglan, lovenox, recent
   dilantin. Pattern not suggestive of obstructive process or alcoholic
   hepatitis. LFTs modestly improved today. No major liver pathology noted
   on CT, though limited by lack of contrast. Splenomegaly raises question
   of underlying portal hypertension from alcoholic liver disease.
   - continue to trend
   - check hepB/C serologies
   - limit acetaminophen to 2g/day
   .
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   --discuss ways of improving trach occlusion with IP, this may mean
   removing stent
   -- can restart TF as regurgitation is oropharyngeal/gastric
   -- continue suctioning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Will likely require long term weaning.
   --discuss with IP long term mgmt of trach
   --management of secretions as per above
   ..
   # Gastritis/Esophagitis:   Hcts have been stable
   -change protonix to PO BID
   -Monitor daily Hct in setting of anticoagulation
   - Maintain active T+S.
   .
   # Agitated Delirium: Improved.
   H/o EtoH abuse but well outside the window of DTs at this time. Mental
   status currently improved. Following commands.
   Prolongued ICU stay, infection, electrolyte disturbances may be
   contributory.
   - d/c Haldol given depressed mental status
   - infectious workup as above
   - Follow QTc with daily EKG
   - can trial zydis prn agitation
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   Now improved following increased free H20 flushes and D5
   - Continue free H20 flushes, follow Na daily
   .
   # Long term access:
   -- consult surgery for portacath placement
   -- dc CVL after portacath placement
   # Nutrition:
   -- TF continuous 24 hours
   -- TPN discontinued.
   # Sz Activity:
   No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have discontinued phenytoin.
   --needs outpt f/u with neuro after this hospital course
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus
   --cont diltiazem
   --continue lovenox, hold warfarin for now in case of procedure
   .
   # DVT:
   -- lovenox
   -- restart warfarin when no longer needing procedures
   .
    # COPD: no active issues
   - cont inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: Trending her hct. Transfuse hct>21.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and subsequently intubated for respiratory failure. She has been on antibiotics for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has been in the ICU for an extended period. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection. However, the fever is only mildly elevated and the c-reactive protein (CRP) levels are within normal range, suggesting a possible non-infectious cause.

2. Abdominal pain with nausea/vomiting: The patient's abdominal pain has improved, and there are no signs of acute processes on the abdominal CT scan. The most likely cause of the symptoms is gastritis/esophagitis, which can be treated with proton pump inhibitors.

3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, but they have shown improvement over time. This could be due to medication side effects, such as diltiazem, reglan, lovenox, or dilantin. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

4. Oropharyngeal dysphagia: The patient has difficulty swallowing due to pharyngeal muscle weakness. This will require intensive rehabilitation and may involve removing the tracheostomy stent.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient will likely require long-term"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia was
   transferred from [**State 507**] after being found unresponsive at home on
   [**2169-3-7**] and s/p intubation for respiratory failure, now on abx for
   presumed VAP.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Only low grade temps in last 24h, WBC improved
   Treating for suspected VAP versus tracheobronchitis with meropenem (d1=
   [**4-13**], today d7) plan for 10 day course. Cxs remain negative.
   Other potential sources include line, cdiff, UTI
 less likely
   - f/u pending micro, culture if spikes
   - send line tip culture when out
   .
   # Abdominal pain with n/v
   Pain improved, belly soft.  Could be due to known gastritis/esophagitis
 no ulcers on recent EGD. C diff negative x2. CT abd without acute
   process.
   - follow abdominal exam today
   .
   # Transaminitis
   Improved on serial tests
   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to med effect
 eg diltiazem, reglan, lovenox, recent
   dilantin. Pattern not suggestive of obstructive process or alcoholic
   hepatitis. LFTs modestly improved today. No major liver pathology noted
   on CT, though limited by lack of contrast. Splenomegaly raises question
   of underlying portal hypertension from alcoholic liver disease.
   - continue to trend
   - follow up  hepB/C serologies
   - limit acetaminophen to 2g/day
   .
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   --discuss ways of improving trach occlusion with IP, this may mean
   removing stent
   -- can restart TF as regurgitation is oropharyngeal/gastric
   -- continue suctioning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Will likely require long term weaning.
   --discuss with IP long term mgmt of trach
   --management of secretions as per above
   ..
   # Gastritis/Esophagitis:   Hcts have been stable
   - protonix PO BID
   -Monitor daily Hct in setting of anticoagulation
   - Maintain active T+S.
   .
   # Agitated Delirium: Improved.
   H/o EtoH abuse but well outside the window of DTs at this time. Mental
   status currently improved. Following commands.
   Prolongued ICU stay, infection, electrolyte disturbances may be
   contributory.
   - infectious workup as above
   - can trial zydis prn agitation
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   Now improved following increased free H20 flushes and D5
   - Continue free H20 flushes, follow Na daily
   .
   # Sz Activity:
   No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have discontinued phenytoin.
   --needs outpt f/u with neuro after this hospital course
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus
   --cont diltiazem
   --continue lovenox, hold warfarin for now in case of procedure
   .
   # DVT:
   -- lovenox
   -- restart warfarin when no longer needing procedures
   .
    # COPD: no active issues
   - cont inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: Trending her hct. Transfuse hct>21.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia.
- She was transferred from another facility after being found unresponsive at home and intubated for respiratory failure.
- She is currently on antibiotics for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient has experienced an acute episode of vomiting green bilious material, hypoxia, and tachycardia.
- She has also had a decrease in urine output and received 500ml NS boluses twice.
- The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a tracheostomy tube, using pressure support, and receiving supplemental oxygen.
- Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/50 mmHg to 150/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Imaging studies show limited lung volumes without significant infiltrates.
- The patient has been treated for suspected VAP, tracheobronchitis, abdominal pain, transaminitis, oropharyngeal dysphagia, respiratory failure, gastritis/esophag"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who was found unresponsive at home and intubated for respiratory failure. She has been in the ICU for an extended period of time and is currently being treated for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed, including agitation, blood loss anemia, tachycardia, tracheobronchitis, transaminitis, oropharyngeal dysphagia, respiratory failure, seizure activity, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Agitation: The patient's agitation has worsened over the last few days. This could be due to prolonged ICU stay, infection, or medications. It is important to continue redirecting the patient frequently and consider using zydis as needed for agitation. Psychiatric input would be appreciated.

2. Blood loss anemia: The patient has a history of gastritis and esophagitis, which may be causing slow bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, and there was an appropriate rise post-transfusion. It is recommended to continue PPI therapy, maintain active temperature and sleep monitoring, resume lovenox with close monitoring, and trend hct.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has a history of paroxys"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia was
   transferred from [**State 507**] after being found unresponsive at home on
   [**2169-3-7**] and s/p intubation for respiratory failure, now on abx for
   presumed VAP.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:
   Only low grade temps in last 24h, WBC improved
   Treating for suspected VAP versus tracheobronchitis with meropenem (d1=
   [**4-13**], today d7) plan for 10 day course. Cxs remain negative.
   Other potential sources include line, cdiff, UTI
 less likely
   - f/u pending micro, culture if spikes
   - send line tip culture when out
   .
   # Abdominal pain with n/v
   Pain improved, belly soft.  Could be due to known gastritis/esophagitis
 no ulcers on recent EGD. C diff negative x2. CT abd without acute
   process.
   - follow abdominal exam today
   .
   # Transaminitis
   Improved on serial tests
   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to med effect
 eg diltiazem, reglan, lovenox, recent
   dilantin. Pattern not suggestive of obstructive process or alcoholic
   hepatitis. LFTs modestly improved today. No major liver pathology noted
   on CT, though limited by lack of contrast. Splenomegaly raises question
   of underlying portal hypertension from alcoholic liver disease.
   - continue to trend
   - follow up  hepB/C serologies
   - limit acetaminophen to 2g/day
   .
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   -- continue reglan
   --discuss ways of improving trach occlusion with IP, this may mean
   removing stent
   -- can restart TF as regurgitation is oropharyngeal/gastric
   -- continue suctioning
   .
   # Anemia- check repeat CBC,  HD stable. Will trend if real value.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Will likely require long term weaning. Likely
   aspiration event last night.
   -- decrease PS today
   --discuss with IP long term mgmt of trach
   --management of secretions as per above
   ..
   # Gastritis/Esophagitis:   Hcts have been stable
   - protonix PO BID
   -Monitor daily Hct in setting of anticoagulation
   - Maintain active T+S.
   .
   # Agitated Delirium: Improved.
   H/o EtoH abuse but well outside the window of DTs at this time. Mental
   status currently improved. Following commands.
   Prolongued ICU stay, infection, electrolyte disturbances may be
   contributory.
   - infectious workup as above
   - can trial zydis prn agitation
   .
   # Hypernatremia
   Now improved following increased free H20 flushes and D5
   - Continue free H20 flushes, follow Na daily
   .
   # Sz Activity:
   No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have discontinued phenytoin.
   --needs outpt f/u with neuro after this hospital course
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus
   --cont diltiazem
   --continue lovenox, hold warfarin if HCT stable
   .
   # DVT:
   -- lovenox
   -- restart warfarin if HCT stable
   .
    # COPD: no active issues
   - cont inhalers
   .
   # Anemia: Trending her hct. Transfuse hct>21.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, who was found unresponsive at home and intubated for respiratory failure. She has been on antibiotics for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. Close monitoring of white blood cell count is necessary.
2. Abdominal pain with nausea/vomiting: The patient's abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting may be due to known gastritis/esophagitis. However, further evaluation is needed to rule out other causes such as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) or urinary tract infection (UTI).
3. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which refers to elevated liver enzymes. This could be due to medication effects, such as diltiazem, reglan, lovenox, or recent dilantin. It is important to continue monitoring liver function tests and limit acetaminophen intake.
4. Oropharyngeal dysphagia: The patient has oropharyngeal dysphagia, which may be caused by pharyngeal muscle weakness. Intensive rehabilitation is recommended, and measures should be taken to improve tracheostomy occlusion.
5. Anemia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial disorder, currently admitted to the ICU for treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has been on a tracheostomy tube with intermittent pressure support ventilation. Her recent events include 50cc bilious emesis overnight, low urine output briefly, and agitation that has improved with haloperidol. The patient's heart rate has been better overnight in the range of 70-90 beats per minute. The doctor has increased the dose of diltiazem to 90 QID. The patient's hematocrit trend is stable in the range of 29-30. The long-term goal is to decannulate and pursue surgery within 2-4 weeks. The patient also needs further evaluation of reflux issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient is being treated for suspected VAP, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis if not effectively managed.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is still elevated, which may be due to delirium or underlying conditions such as pulmonary hypertension or arrhythmia.
3. Oropharyngeal dysphagia: The patient has ongoing bilious emesis, indicating possible oropharyngeal dysphagia. This can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia and choking.
4. Blood loss anemia: The patient has a history of gastr"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia was
   transferred from [**State 507**] after being found unresponsive at home on
   [**2169-3-7**] and s/p intubation for respiratory failure, now on abx for
   presumed VAP.
   .
   # Agitated Delirium:
   Worsened agitation over last few days. Sleeping poorly.
   H/o EtoH abuse but well outside the window of DTs at this time.
   Prolongued ICU stay, infection, meds  may be contributory.
   - infectious workup as above
   - can trial zydis prn agitation
   - redirect frequently
   - psych input appreciated
   # Blood loss anemia, h/o gastritis and esophagitis
   Appropriate rise post transfusion. Likely slow ooze from known
   gastritis/esophagitis
   - trend hct [**Hospital1 **] for now, transfuse hct>25
   - continue ppi, maintain active t+s
   - resume lovenox with close monitoring
   # Tachycardia, h/o PAF
   --cont diltiazem, will consider further increase
   --continue lovenox
   --f/u i+o gain net even
   # Tracheobronchitis
   Only low grade temps in last 24h, WBC improved
   Treating for suspected VAP versus tracheobronchitis with meropenem (d1=
   [**4-13**], today d8) plan for 10 day course. Cxs remain negative.
   - f/u pending micro, culture if spikes
   # Transaminitis
   Improved on serial tests
   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to med effect
 eg diltiazem, reglan, lovenox, recent
   dilantin. Pattern not suggestive of obstructive process or alcoholic
   hepatitis. LFTs modestly improved today. No major liver pathology noted
   on CT, though limited by lack of contrast. Splenomegaly raises question
   of underlying portal hypertension from alcoholic liver disease. HepB/C
   serologies negative
   - continue to trend
   - limit acetaminophen to 2g/day
   .
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   -- continue reglan
   -- can restart TF as regurgitation is oropharyngeal/gastric
   -- continue suctioning
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Will likely require long term weaning.
   --PSV overnight
   --discuss with IP long term mgmt of trach
   --management of secretions as per above
   --appreciate IP recs
   .
   # Sz Activity:
   No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have discontinued phenytoin.
   --needs outpt f/u with neuro after this hospital course
   .
   # DVT:
   -- lovenox
   -- consider repeat u/s later this week to check for clot resolution
   .
    # COPD: no active issues
   - cont inhalers

","Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia.
- She was found unresponsive at home and intubated for respiratory failure.
- The patient has been on antibiotics for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- She has been experiencing agitation, which may be due to prolonged ICU stay, infection, and medications.
- The patient has a history of blood loss anemia and gastritis/esophagitis.
- She has tachycardia, possibly due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).
- The patient has tracheobronchitis and is being treated for suspected VAP.
- She has transaminitis, which has improved on serial tests.
- The patient has oropharyngeal dysphagia and respiratory failure.
- She had seizure activity but no recent seizures.
- The patient has deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- She is on multiple medications, including diltiazem, lovenox, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation: The patient's agitation could worsen, leading to increased distress and potential harm to herself or others.
2. Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's blood loss anemia may continue, potentially requiring further transfusions and monitoring of hemoglobin levels.
3. Gastritis/E"

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial with long ICU course
   here on treatment for VAP and on trach mask/pressure support
   intermittently with improved delirium on haldol.
   .
   # Agitated Delirium:  [**2-14**] ICU delirium.  Improved with trial of haldol
   yesterday. QTC not prolonged.
   - change haldol to 0.5mg morning, afternoon, and 1mg QHS checking [**Hospital1 **]
   EKGs for QTC (goal less than 0.5)
   - discontinue erythomycin which also prolongs QTC
   - redirect frequently
   - psych input appreciated
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.  Has continued to have bilious emesis
   -- get GI opinion on further evaluation/treatment of reflux
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   -- continue reglan
   -- continue tube feeds, no need to hold
   -- continue suctioning
   # Tachycardia, h/o PAF. Improved on increased dilt dosing. Management
   of delirium also helps tachycardia
   --cont increased dose of diltiazem
   --continue lovenox
   --f/u i+o gain net even
   # Tracheobronchitis
   Only low grade temps in last 24h, WBC improved
   Treating for suspected VAP versus tracheobronchitis with meropenem (d1=
   [**4-13**], today d9) plan for 10 day course. Cxs remain negative. Can dc
   meropenem tomorrow.
   - f/u pending micro, culture if spikes
   # Blood loss anemia, h/o gastritis and esophagitis
   Hct has remained stable, has not required transfusion for >24hrs Likely

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malformation, currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and on tracheostomy with pressure support. She has improved delirium and is receiving haloperidol for agitation. The patient's recent events include bilious emesis, low urine output, and increased heart rate. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 124/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals no new findings, and her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated liver enzymes and lactate levels. The patient is on multiple medications, including diltiazem, lovenox, pantoprazole, and others.

Potential medical complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is still experiencing episodes of delirium, as evidenced by her agitation and fluctuating mental status. This can increase the risk of falls, self-removal of the tracheostomy tube, and other complications. Appropriate management strategies should be continued, such as the use of haloperidol and redirection techniques.
2. Oropharyngeal dysphagia: The patient has been diagnosed with oropharyngeal dysphag"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial disease who has been in the ICU for a long duration. She is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is on a tracheostomy mask with intermittent pressure support. The patient's agitation has improved with the use of haloperidol. She also has oropharyngeal dysphagia, with pharyngeal muscle weakness and ongoing bilious emesis. The patient has tachycardia, possibly related to delirium, and is on diltiazem. She has tracheobronchitis, with negative sputum cultures so far. The patient has blood loss anemia due to a history of gastritis and esophagitis. She has hypernatremia and respiratory failure due to tracheobronchial disease with the tracheostomy in place. She will likely require long-term weaning. The patient's seizure activity is currently under control, and she has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for which she is receiving heparin. She also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but there are no active issues at present.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued reflux and potential aspiration pneumonia.
2. Potential worsening of oropharyngeal dysphagia and associated complications such as aspiration.
3. Delirium and agitation, which may"

   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial with long ICU course
   here on treatment for VAP and on trach mask/pressure support
   intermittently with improved delirium on haldol.
   .
   # Agitated Delirium:  [**2-14**] ICU delirium.  Improved with trial of haldol
   yesterday. QTC not prolonged.
   - change haldol to 0.5mg morning, afternoon, and 1mg QHS checking [**Hospital1 **]
   EKGs for QTC (goal less than 0.5)
   - discontinue erythomycin which also prolongs QTC
   - redirect frequently
   - psych input appreciated
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.  Has continued to have bilious emesis
   -- get GI opinion on further evaluation/treatment of reflux
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   -- continue reglan
   -- continue tube feeds, no need to hold
   -- continue suctioning
   # Tachycardia, h/o PAF. Improved on increased dilt dosing. Management
   of delirium also helps tachycardia
   --cont increased dose of diltiazem
   --continue lovenox
   --f/u i+o gain net even
   # Tracheobronchitis
   Only low grade temps in last 24h, WBC improved
   Treating for suspected VAP versus tracheobronchitis with meropenem (d1=
   [**4-13**], today d9) plan for 10 day course. Cxs remain negative. Can dc
   meropenem tomorrow.
   - f/u pending micro, culture if spikes
   # Blood loss anemia, h/o gastritis and esophagitis
   Hct has remained stable, has not required transfusion for >24hrs Likely
   slow ooze from known gastritis/esophagitis
   - trend hct [**Hospital1 **] for now, transfuse hct>25
   - continue ppi, maintain active t+s
   - continue lovenox
   # Transaminitis
   Improved on serial tests
   [**Month (only) 8**] be due to med effect
 eg diltiazem, reglan, lovenox, recent
   dilantin. Pattern not suggestive of obstructive process or alcoholic
   hepatitis. LFTs modestly improved today. No major liver pathology noted
   on CT, though limited by lack of contrast. Splenomegaly raises question
   of underlying portal hypertension from alcoholic liver disease. HepB/C
   serologies negative
   - continue to trend
   - limit acetaminophen to 2g/day
   .
   # Respiratory failure: TBM with trach in place. Will likely require
   long term weaning.
   --continue trach mask during day, pressure support at night. Has been
   tolerating this well
   --Appreciate IP recs
   --management of secretions as per above
   .
   # Sz Activity:
   No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have discontinued phenytoin.
   --needs outpt f/u with neuro after this hospital course

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who has been in the ICU for a long course of treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on a tracheostomy mask with pressure support. The patient's current medical conditions include agitation and delirium, oropharyngeal dysphagia, tachycardia, tracheobronchitis, blood loss anemia, transaminitis, respiratory failure, seizure activity, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including haloperidol for agitation, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, diltiazem for tachycardia, meropenem for suspected VAP, enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis, and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 108/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 50%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, elevated lactate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old individual with a medical history of tracheobronchial malacia. They are currently in the ICU for secretions and tracheobronchitis. The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa. They received erythromycin and meropenem as antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/78 mmHg to 141/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4,117 mL and output of 1,560 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,557 mL. They are receiving nutrition through a tracheostomy tube with Vivonex at a rate of 65 mL/hour. The patient's glycemic control is managed with regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, platelet count of 41 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, glucose level ranging from 165 mg/dL to 116 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal range. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 332 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 150. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH of 7.32.

The patient's physical examination reveals normal head, ears, nose, and throat; symmetric chest expansion; rhonchorous breath sounds; soft and non-tender abdomen; trace edema in both lower extremities; and no skin abnormalities. The patient follows simple commands and responds appropriately.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory insufficiency due to tracheobronchial malacia, delirium, dysphagia, and reflux. The plan includes rehabilitation with ventilation during the day and pressure support at night. The patient is currently on meropenem and will have their lines removed after the last dose. They are receiving nutrition through a tracheostomy tube and have a plan for rehabilitation with vent. The patient's delirium has improved with haloperidol, and their QT interval is stable.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and glycemic control issues."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, currently in the ICU for secretions and tracheobronchitis. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory insufficiency. They have allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa. The patient has been receiving various medications including enoxaparin, pantoprazole, and antibiotics. They have been intubated and on mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is tolerating tracheostomy mask during the day but requires mechanical ventilator support at night. There is a plan for rehab with vent support and consideration of a Passer-Muir valve.
2. Pneumonia: The patient continues to have secretions but seems to be improving.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium has improved with the use of haldol. It is important to monitor the QT interval stability by ECG.
4. Dysphagia/Reflux: An emptying study and impedance study are recommended for further evaluation and management.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on systemic anticoagulation prophylaxis.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient is on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) prophylaxis.
7. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchial malformation, multiple stents, tracheostomy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), alcoholism, and altered mental status (AMS). She was admitted to the ICU over a month ago after being found unresponsive at home. Her current active issues include excessive secretions, atrial ectopy, and delirium.

24-hour events:
- A gastric emptying study and impedance study are pending and likely to occur early next week.
- A peripherally inserted intravenous (PIV) line has been placed, and the plan is to pull the subclavian central venous line as meropenem has been completed.
- The patient's agitation is under better control with a haloperidol regimen, keeping the QTc interval <0.5.

Allergies:
- The patient is allergic to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides).

Last dose of antibiotics:
- Erythromycin was administered on 04:00 AM, 04/21/2169.
- Meropenem was administered from 04:00 AM, 04/23/2169, and completed today.

   - continue ppi, maintain active t+s
   # Hypernatremia
   Continue free h20 flushes, follow Na daily
   # Respiratory failure: TBM with trach in place. Will likely require
   long term weaning.
   --continue trach mask during day, pressure support at night. Has been
   tolerating this well
   --Appreciate IP recs

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, COPD, ethanolism, and acute memory syndrome. She has been admitted to the ICU for over a month and continues to experience excessive secretions, atrial ectopy, and delirium. The patient's agitation is being managed with haloperidol, and her QTc interval is being monitored.

24-hour events include the placement of a peripheral IV line, completion of meropenem, and planning to pull the subclavian central venous line. The patient's tracheostomy tube will be used for respiratory support, and she is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 310 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. Her blood gases show pH 7.31, PaCO2 31 mmHg, PaO2 117 mmHg, and bicarbonate 28.0 mEq/L.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/79 mmHg to 177/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of Tuberculosis (TBM) who has undergone tracheostomy (TM) and is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). She has completed her antibiotic course and is being treated for delirium with haloperidol. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/59 to 177/133 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%.

The patient's current medications include enoxaparin (Lovenox), pantoprazole (Protonix), carafate (Sucralfate), and haloperidol (Haldol). She has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa (sulfonamides).

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for psychiatric/sleep issues, where she is delirious. Physical examination findings include somnolence, tracheostomy site, normal heart sounds, right and left lower extremity edema, and unassessed skin and neurologic examination.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with tracheobronchomalacia, admitted for occlusion of stent and recurrent pneumonia. She has chronic respiratory failure and presumed aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently delirious and receiving treatment with haloperidol. She is ready for ventilator weaning rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of tracheobronchomalacia and recurrent pneumonia puts her at risk for further respiratory complications. These may include worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and aspiration events.

2. Delirium: The patient is currently experiencing delirium, which can increase the risk of falls, self-removal of tubes or lines, and difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.

3. Infection: The patient's history of pneumonia and presence of tracheostomy increases the risk of developing healthcare-associated infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and low molecular weight heparin should be continued.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other medications that may irritate the gastrointestinal lining can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding"

   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia with long
   ICU course here on treatment for VAP and on trach mask/pressure support
   intermittently with improved delirium on haldol awaiting rehab bed for
   long term vent weaning
   .
   # Delirium:  [**2-14**] ICU delirium, infection, lyte disturbance. Improved on
   increased haldol yesterday, off restraints this AM. QTC .45 on this
   regimen
   - continue haldol 0.5mg/0.5mg/2mg and 1mg PO BID prn
   - follow EKG daily, goal QTC<0.5
   - redirect frequently
   # Respiratory failure: TBM with trach in place. Will likely require
   long term weaning.
   --continue trach mask during day, pressure support at night. Has been
   tolerating this well
   --Appreciate IP recs
   --management of secretions as per above
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated pharnygeal muscle
   weakness.  Has had no bilous emesis overnight. GI following and has
   recommendations for outpatient impedance and gastric motility studies.
   Also, we added H2 blocker in addition to PPI per GI
   -- continue PPI and H2 blocker
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scop patch
   -- continue reglan
   -- continue tube feeds, no need to hold
   -- continue suctioning
   -- will need GI followup as outpatient
   # Tachycardia, h/o PAF. Resolved. Likely in setting of delirium, now
   improved.
   --cont increased dose of diltiazem
   --continue lovenox
   --f/u i+o gain net even
   # Tracheobronchitis/pna: s/p 10d of meropenem (last day [**4-23**]). No fever
   spikes since
   # Blood loss anemia, h/o gastritis and esophagitis
   Hct has remained stable, has not required transfusion for >48s Likely
   slow ooze from known gastritis/esophagitis
   - trend hct daily for now transfuse hct>25
   - continue ppi, maintain active t+s
   .
   # Sz Activity:
   No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have discontinued phenytoin.
   --needs outpt f/u with neuro after this hospital course

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She has been in the ICU for an extended period and is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's delirium has improved with increased doses of Haldol, and she is no longer restrained. Her QTc level is normal. 

The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube and CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her blood gases show adequate oxygenation but decreased expiratory volume. 

Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight variation in blood pressure. She has a decreased heart rate and normal respiratory rate. Her temperature is within normal range. 

The patient's physical examination reveals upper airway noises and decreased breath sounds at the bases. Her cardiovascular examination is unremarkable. She has no peripheral edema or skin abnormalities. 

Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count. Her kidney function is normal, but there is evidence of electrolyte disturbance. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Delirium: The patient's delirium has improved with increased doses of Haldol. She will continue on this medication, along with daily EKG monitoring to ensure QTc levels remain below 0.5.
2. Respiratory failure"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with COPD and TBM who presented with respiratory failure. She underwent a Y-stent, tracheostomy, and peg placement and is now improving. The patient has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. She received meropenem antibiotics which were discontinued. She is currently on various medications including pantoprazole, enoxaparin, diltiazem, haldol, reglan, and sucralfate.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/40 to 150/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 445 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%.

The patient's general appearance is well-nourished, but she has poor dentition and a tracheostomy. Her cardiovascular examination shows a distant S2 heart sound, and her peripheral vascular examination reveals trace edema in both lower extremities. Her respiratory examination indicates coarse rhonchi bilaterally. Neurological assessment is not performed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 262"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with COPD and TBM who presented with respiratory failure. She has undergone a Y-stent, tracheostomy, and peg placement. The patient is currently improving. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient has delirium, which is improving. It is important to continue administering haloperidol (Haldol) at 0.5 mg and 2 mg at bedtime. Daily EKGs should be done to monitor QTc, and electrolyte levels should be maintained with mg > 2 and K > 4.

2. Oropharyngeal Dysphagia/Reflux: The patient has oropharyngeal dysphagia and reflux. Continuing reglan, PPI, and H2 blocker is recommended. A gastric emptying study should be coordinated as an outpatient, and an impedance study should be done in the outpatient setting as well.

3. Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia: The patient has atrial fibrillation/tachycardia, which is improving. It is important to continue administering diltiazem and to continue low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox).

4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia.

5. Gastritis: The patient appears stable with no further HCT drop, and it is important to continue PPI (pantoprazole) prophylaxis.

6. Respiratory Failure: The patient has TBM (tracheobronchomalacia), gastric reflux, oral secretions, but overall improving. It is important to continue TM (tracheostomy tube) during the day and vent (mechanical ventilation) at night.

ICU Care:
Nutrition: The patient is receiving Vivonex (full) at a rate of 65 mL/hour.
Glycemic Control: Regular insulin sliding scale is being used.
Lines: The patient has a 22-gauge line in place.
Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prophylaxis with head-of-bed elevation. The need for restraints should be reviewed regularly.
Communication: The patient was discussed during interdisciplinary rounds, and her code status is full code.
Disposition: The patient will be transferred to a rehab/long-term care facility.
Total time spent: 35 minutes."

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She has been in the ICU for a long time and is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) while awaiting a rehabilitation bed for long-term ventilation weaning.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing ICU delirium, which has improved with increased doses of haloperidol (Haldol). She is currently off restraints and her QTc interval on the current regimen is 0.45. The plan is to continue Haldol at a dose of 0.5 mg/0.5 mg/2 mg and 1 mg PO BID prn. Daily EKGs will be followed to monitor the QTc interval and keep it below 0.5. The patient should be redirected frequently and a repeat urine analysis/culture (UA/Cx) will be done.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has tracheobronchial malacia with a tracheostomy in place. She is likely to require long-term weaning from mechanical ventilation. The plan is to continue using a tracheostomy mask during the day and provide pressure support at night. The patient's tolerance of this regimen has been good. Intensive rehabilitation will be necessary.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia.
- She has been in the ICU for a long time and is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient is currently on a tracheostomy tube with pressure support ventilation and is awaiting rehabilitation for long-term ventilation weaning.
- She has been experiencing delirium, which has improved with increased doses of haloperidol (Haldol).
- The patient's recent events include agitation overnight, which responded to an extra dose of Haldol, and the removal of her Foley catheter.
- She feels okay in the morning but is paranoid about someone trying to take her money.
- Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 141/53 to 154/78 mmHg, heart rate between 103-120 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events.
- The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.3-7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 256-262 K/uL, sodium level of 135-145 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.8-4.3 mEq/L, and an albumin level of 2.4 g/dL.
- The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear lungs bilaterally, regular heart sounds without murmurs or gallops, soft nontender abdomen with bowel sounds, warm extremities without edema, and oriented to person, place, and time but has trouble completing the days of the week backwards. She is moving her extremities and follows commands.
- The patient's assessment includes delirium, infection, electrolyte disturbance, potential Clostridium difficile infection, respiratory failure, oropharyngeal dysphagia, tachycardia, tracheobronchitis/pneumonia, blood loss anemia, seizure activity, deep vein thrombosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is still experiencing delirium, which has improved with increased doses of Haldol. It is important to continue redirecting the patient frequently and monitor for any worsening symptoms.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of infection and is currently on treatment for VAP. Monitoring for fever spikes and repeating urine cultures is important to detect any potential new infections.
3. Electrolyte Disturbance: The patient's electrolyte levels need to be closely monitored, especially sodium and potassium levels. Any imbalances should be corrected promptly.
4. Clostridium difficile Infection: Given the recent antibiotic use"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who has been in the ICU for an extended period. She is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is on a tracheostomy tube with pressure support. The patient's delirium has improved with increased doses of haloperidol (Haldol) but still requires ongoing management. She is awaiting a rehabilitation bed for long-term ventilator weaning.

The patient's respiratory failure is expected to require long-term weaning, and she is tolerating tracheostomy mask during the day and pressure support at night. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is present, and the patient has had no bilious emesis overnight. A swallowing and speech evaluation indicated pharyngeal muscle weakness. The patient will need intensive rehabilitation and follow-up with gastroenterology for outpatient impedance and gastric motility studies. She is currently receiving proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 blockers.

The patient's tachycardia, possibly related to delirium, has resolved. She is on an increased dose of diltiazem and will continue to have close monitoring of her intake and output (I/O) balance. The patient's tracheobronchitis/pneumonia appears to be improving, as there have been no fever spikes since completing a 10-day course of meropenem. She has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD and tuberculosis who presented with respiratory failure, likely due to the progression of tuberculosis. She has undergone Y-stent placement, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient is currently improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation: The patient is on stable Haldol and is improving. Further reorientation and day-night stability should be continued. There are no current signs of infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has significantly improved. She should continue to be on pressure support ventilation (PSV) at night and spontaneous/timed-cue mandatory ventilation (tcm) during the day.
3.? SZR (seizure zone response?): The patient is off Depakote, and follow-up with neurology is needed.
4. Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient should continue on Lovenox (low molecular weight heparin) and start Coumadin transition at rehab.
5. GI work-up: A gastrointestinal work-up will need to be deferred until the patient regains strength and can tolerate a regular oral diet. She should continue on Reglan, erythromycin, PPI, and H2 blocker.

ICU care includes nutrition with Vivonex (full) at 65 mL/hour and glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and delirium/brain injury. She is awaiting a rehabilitation bed for long-term ventilator weaning. The patient has experienced a low-grade temperature and loose stools, which may indicate Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Her recent labs show stable vital signs, improved delirium, and no new abnormalities. The patient's past medical history includes COPD, atrial fibrillation, blood loss anemia, gastritis, esophagitis, and seizure activity. She is currently on multiple medications including haloperidol for delirium, proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers for stress ulcers, enoxaparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), warfarin for DVT, and diltiazem for tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff infection: The patient's symptoms of low-grade temperature and loose stools raise the possibility of C. diff infection, especially considering her recent antibiotic use. Further testing is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying tracheobronchial malacia and prolonged ICU course put her at risk for continued respiratory failure. She will require long-term ventilator weaning, and close monitoring of her respiratory status is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She has been in the ICU for a long period of time and is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is on a tracheostomy tube and pressure support ventilation intermittently. Her delirium has improved with increased doses of haloperidol, and she is no longer restrained. She is awaiting a rehabilitation bed for long-term weaning from the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient had improved delirium on haloperidol but may require ongoing monitoring and management to prevent its recurrence.
2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient's symptoms of low-grade fever and loose stools could indicate a C. diff infection. Further evaluation is needed, and if positive, she should be notified about it, especially regarding her rehabilitation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's tracheobronchial malacia may lead to ongoing respiratory failure. Long-term weaning from the ventilator will likely be required.
4. Oropharyngeal dysphagia: The patient has pharyngeal muscle weakness, which could contribute to oropharyngeal dysphagia. She will need intensive rehabilitation and ongoing management.
5. Tachycardia: The patient had an episode of tachycardia, which has resolved. It"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She has been in the ICU for a long course of respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and delirium/brain injury. She is awaiting a rehab bed for long-term ventilator weaning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient has shown improvement in delirium on haloperidol (Haldol), but it is important to continue the medication and monitor for any worsening of symptoms.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea could be due to tube feeds or recent antibiotics. A follow-up for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) should be done, and the patient should be monitored for any signs of infection.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tracheobronchial malacia with tracheostomy in place requires long-term weaning from the ventilator. She will continue to use a tracheostomy mask during the day and pressure support at night. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is necessary.
4. Oropharyngeal Dysphagia: The patient has swallowing muscle weakness, which may lead to difficulty in eating and drinking. Intensive rehabilitation and outpatient impedance and gastric motility studies are recommended.
5. Tachycardia: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and is currently experiencing"

Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, blood pressure of 115/60 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her lab results show a WBC count of 7.3, Hct of 27.8%, and platelet count of 75,000/mm³. She has ongoing issues with delirium, diarrhea, respiratory failure, oropharyngeal dysphagia, tachycardia, recent hospital-acquired pneumonia, blood loss anemia, seizure activity, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient has shown improvement in delirium on haloperidol, but it is important to continue monitoring and redirecting frequently.
2. Diarrhea:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD and TBM who presented with respiratory failure. She has undergone tracheostomy and peg placement, and is now awaiting transfer to a ventilator rehabilitation facility. The patient's condition has been stable overnight with no events. She has allergies to penicillins, tetracycline, and sulfa medications. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure of 165/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. Other lab results are also within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is showing improvement with standing haldol. It is recommended to continue with standing haldol and frequent redirection to maintain day/night cycle.
2. Diarrhea: The diarrhea is likely due to tube feeds. Starting bulking agents and lomotil may help alleviate this issue.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved. It is advised to continue pressure support ventilation at night and wean the ventilator gradually. Follow-up with a pulmonologist is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia with long
   ICU course here on treatment for VAP and on trach mask/pressure support
   intermittently with improved delirium on haldol awaiting rehab bed for
   long term vent weaning
   .
   # Delirium:  [**2-14**] ICU delirium, infection, lyte disturbance. Improved on
   increased haldol yesterday, off restraints >48hr. QTC .45 on this
   regimen
   - continue haldol 0.5mg/0.5mg/2mg and 1mg PO BID prn
   - follow EKGs with goal QTC<0.5
   - redirect frequently
   - f/up recent urine culture ( UA neg)
   .
   #Diarrhea : likely from tube feeds but given recent antibiotics
   C.difficile in differential as well. Patient has no WBC elevation but
   had a mild elevation in temp again last night.
   - cdiff negative
   - likely just from tube feeds
   - can give banana flakes prn
   # Respiratory failure: TBM with trach in place. Will now need long term
   weaning. Plan is to continue trach mask during day, pressure support at
   night. Has been tolerating this well
   --Appreciate IP recs.
   --Outpatient f/up has been arranged
   --management of secretions as per above
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated swallowing muscle
   weakness.  Has had no additional bilious emesis overnight. GI following
   and has recommendations for outpatient impedance and gastric motility
   studies. Also, we added H2 blocker in addition to PPI per GI. No reflux
   >24 hours
   -- continue PPI and H2 blocker
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scopolamine  patch
   -- continue reglan
   -- continue tube feeds, no need to hold
   -- continue suctioning
   -- has had GI followup arranged as outpatient
   # Tachycardia, h/o PAF. Resolving slowly. Atrial ectopy has tapered off
   now after recent uptitration of Diltiazem. Mostly all sinus tachycardia
   now that seems to flare up with delirium and agitation episodes.
   --cont increased dose of diltiazem
   --continue Lovenox & warfarin
   --f/up I/Os, continue to keep even
   # Recent HAP PNA :  now  s/p 10d of meropenem (last day [**4-23**]).  Mild
   fever since but no changes in usual sputum and secretions. Recent
   blood/sputum cultures all negative.
   # Blood loss anemia, h/o gastritis and esophagitis:  Hct has remained
   stable in the 27-28 range, has not required transfusion for several
   days. Likely slow ooze from known gastritis/esophagitis. GI aware and
   plan to follow-up as outpatient.
   - trend Hct daily for now transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI and H2B, maintain active T&S
   .
   # Seizure Activity: No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have
   discontinued phenytoin at this time.
   --patient will plan to follow-up as outpt with neuro after this
   hospital course
   .
   # DVT:
   -- on lovenox,  can start on Coumadin at rehab ( goal INR [**2-15**], then can
   d/c lovenox)
   .
    # COPD: no active issues

   Disposition: ICU, awaiting rehab bed for long term weaning
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who has been in the ICU for a long period of time. She is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is on a tracheostomy mask with intermittent pressure support. The patient's delirium has improved with increased doses of haloperidol, and she has been off restraints for over 48 hours.

The patient's current medical conditions include delirium, infection, electrolyte disturbance, respiratory failure, oropharyngeal dysphagia, tachycardia, recent hospital-acquired pneumonia, blood loss anemia, and seizure activity. The plan is to continue with haloperidol for delirium management, redirect frequently, and follow up with EKGs to keep the QTc below 0.5. The patient's diarrhea is likely due to tube feeds, and there is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection, but this has been ruled out.

For respiratory failure, the patient will require long-term weaning from mechanical ventilation. The plan is to continue with tracheostomy mask during the day and pressure support at night. The patient's oropharyngeal dysphagia is due to muscle weakness, and she will need intensive rehabilitation. She is also being treated for tachycardia, recent hospital-acquired pneumonia, and blood loss an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia. She has been in the ICU for a long time and is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is on a tracheostomy mask with intermittent pressure support and is showing improvement in delirium. She is awaiting a rehab bed for long-term weaning from the ventilator.

The patient has several medical conditions, including delirium, diarrhea, respiratory failure, oropharyngeal dysphagia, tachycardia, recent hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), blood loss anemia, and a previous seizure episode. Her current medications include haloperidol for delirium, banana flakes for diarrhea, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 blockers for gastrointestinal issues, diltiazem for tachycardia, lovenox and warfarin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and others.

The patient's recent lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating within the normal range. Other lab results indicate normal electrolyte levels, liver function tests, kidney function, and cardiac markers.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia, who has been in the ICU for a long period of time. She is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is currently on a tracheostomy mask with intermittent pressure support. The patient's delirium has improved with increased doses of haloperidol, and she is no longer restrained. She is awaiting a rehabilitation bed for long-term weaning from the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient has shown improvement in her delirium with increased doses of haloperidol, but it is important to continue redirecting her frequently and monitoring her response to the medication. Adjustments to the dosage may be necessary to maintain a QTc <0.5.

2. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be attributed to tube feeds or recent antibiotics. Since her urine culture was negative, Clostridium difficile infection is less likely. However, it is important to monitor her temperature and watch for any signs of worsening condition.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's tracheobronchial malacia requires long-term weaning from the ventilator. She will continue to use a tracheostomy mask during the day and pressure support at night. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and secretions management is crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   57-year-old woman with history of tracheobronchial malacia with long
   ICU course here on treatment for VAP and on trach mask/pressure support
   intermittently with improved delirium on haldol awaiting rehab bed for
   long term vent weaning
   .
   # Delirium:  [**2-14**] ICU delirium, infection, lyte disturbance. Improved on
   increased haldol yesterday, off restraints >48hr. QTC .45 on this
   regimen
   - continue haldol 0.5mg/0.5mg/2mg and 1mg PO BID prn
   - follow EKGs with goal QTC<0.5
   - redirect frequently
   - f/up recent urine culture ( UA neg)
   .
   #Diarrhea : likely from tube feeds but given recent antibiotics
   C.difficile in differential as well. Patient has no WBC elevation but
   had a mild elevation in temp again last night.
   - cdiff negative
   - likely just from tube feeds
   - can give banana flakes TID prn
   # Respiratory failure: TBM with trach in place. Will now need long term
   weaning. Plan is to continue trach mask during day, pressure support at
   night. Has been tolerating this well. Last night was first night she
   was able to tolerate just trach mask all night without PS.
   --Appreciate IP recs.
   --Outpatient f/up has been arranged
   --management of secretions as per above
   # Oropharyngeal dysphagia: S & S eval indicated swallowing muscle
   weakness.  Has had no additional bilious emesis overnight. GI following
   and has recommendations for outpatient impedance and gastric motility
   studies. Also, we added H2 blocker in addition to PPI per GI. No reflux
   >24 hours
   -- continue PPI and H2 blocker
   --will need intensive rehab
   --continue scopolamine  patch
   -- continue reglan
   -- continue tube feeds, no need to hold
   -- continue suctioning
   -- has had GI followup arranged as outpatient
   # Tachycardia, h/o PAF. Resolving slowly. Atrial ectopy has tapered off
   now after recent uptitration of Diltiazem. Mostly all sinus tachycardia
   now that seems to flare up with delirium and agitation episodes.
   --cont increased dose of diltiazem
   --continue Lovenox & warfarin
   --f/up I/Os, continue to keep even
   # Recent HAP PNA :  now  s/p 10d of meropenem (last day [**4-23**]).  Mild
   fever since but no changes in usual sputum and secretions. Recent
   blood/sputum cultures all negative.
   # Blood loss anemia, h/o gastritis and esophagitis:  Hct has remained
   stable in the 27-28 range, has not required transfusion for several
   days. Likely slow ooze from known gastritis/esophagitis. GI aware and
   plan to follow-up as outpatient.
   - trend Hct daily for now transfuse hct>25
   - continue PPI and H2B, maintain active T&S
   .
   # Seizure Activity: No recent seizures. Per d/w neuro, have
   discontinued phenytoin at this time.
   --patient will plan to follow-up as outpt with neuro after this
   hospital course
   .
   # DVT:
   -- on lovenox,  can start on Coumadin at rehab ( goal INR [**2-15**], then can
   d/c lovenox)
   .
    # COPD: no active issues

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of tracheobronchial malacia who has been in the ICU for a long course of treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is currently on a tracheostomy mask and intermittent pressure support with improved delirium. She is awaiting a rehabilitation bed for long-term ventilator weaning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing delirium, which has improved with increased doses of haloperidol. She will continue to be monitored and redirected frequently. Follow-up EKGs will be done to ensure a QTc level less than 0.5.

2. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is likely due to tube feeds, but there is a possibility of Clostridium difficile infection as well. The patient's recent urine culture was negative, so cdiff has been ruled out. The diarrhea is expected to resolve with continued tube feeds.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has tracheobronchial malacia with a tracheostomy in place. She will require long-term weaning from the ventilator. She will continue to be on a tracheostomy mask during the day and pressure support at night. The goal is to eventually remove the pressure support.

4. Oropharyngeal Dysphagia: The patient has muscle weakness in the swallowing muscles, as indicated by a swallowing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of COPD and tuberculosis who has been in the ICU for a prolonged period due to respiratory failure. She has undergone a Y stent and tracheostomy placement. The patient is currently stable, interactive, and delirium-free. She is still on haloperidol doses for redirection and maintaining day-night stability. The patient's respiratory failure has improved and she has been on timed cycled mandatory ventilation (TCM) for 24 hours. The tracheostomy tube cuff has been deflated, allowing for a clear airway. The patient's gastroesophageal reflux will be evaluated when she can tolerate oral intake at an outpatient setting. She is currently on reglan, an H2 blocker, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient has an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and will continue taking Coumadin for a total of three months. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility."
