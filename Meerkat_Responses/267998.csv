","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He is on multiple vasopressors, including vasopressin, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/59-91/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefipime and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ Dysfunction: The patient is currently diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. However, there is a potential risk of developing organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can complicate the patient's condition.

2. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-associated events like ventilator-induced lung injury.

3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient is on multiple vasopressors, indicating significant hypotension. There is a potential risk of developing arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, or cardiac dysfunction due to the prolonged use of"

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   74 y/o M with recent dx of neck cancer at OSH who presented from rehab
   with aggitation, bleeding foley site, hypotension and afib with RVR.
   Intubated at OSH and remains pressor dependent.  Likely cause is PNA as
   seen on CT scan of chest.
   .
   # Shock: likely septic based on respiratory failure and PNA seen on CT
   scan.  Unclear etiology but should be treated for HAP because of recent
   hospitalization, as well as for possible flu.  Other causes on the
   differential include cardiogenic shock as he has a troponin leak and
   some ST changes on EKG.  Could be adrenal insufficiency, but less
   likely.  Did receive 10 mg IV decadron at OSH.
   - continue levophed, neo and vasopressin; wean levophed as tolerated
   today; goal MAP >60
   - place a-line
   - follow lacates, central SVO2
   - fluid resuccitation overnight with CVP goal >8
   - PNA treatment for HAP with vanco/cefepime/levoflox
   - consider broader treatment for anerobes with flagyl
   - flu treatment with oseltamivir until ruled out
   .
   # PNA: treatment as above for HAP and flu.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to pneumonia, did not
   tolerate wean of vent settings after arrival from the ED.  ABG showed
   mild hypoxia; now on AC 500/16, PEEP 8, FiO2 60%.
   - follow serial ABGs, adjust vent as needed
   - ARDS net criteria
   - sedation with fent/versed
   .
   # Afib with RVR: now in normal sinus rhythm; failed two attempts at
   cardioversion at OSH.  No hx of afib per family.
   - continue telemetry
   - no need for systemic anticoagulation at this time
   - consider amio if afib returns
   .
   # Troponin leak: in the setting of afib with RVR is likely secondary to
   demand ischemia.  Cards looked at EKG in the ED without seeing need for
   further anticoagulation.  Received ASA rectally.
   - trend CEs
   - if rising, consider heparin gtt (if hct's stable)
   .
   # Coffee Ground emesis: unclear etiology; not known if patient taking
   NSAIDs, but does have hx of etoh abuse.  S/p one unit PRBCs in the ED
   with appropriate bump.
   - Hct q6hrs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - GI consult
   - guiac stools and emesis
   .
   # Bleeding from foley: presented with aggitation and bleeding from
   foley, likely traumatic; urine draining clear but does have some blood
   at the meatus.
   - follow hcts
   - consider urology consult in AM
   .
   # Neck CA: newly diagnosed, will get records from OSH; unclear if
   treatment options are viable.  Will defer further treatment for now,
   has stable airway.
   - consider onc consult in AM

He was intubated at the outside hospital and remains pressor-dependent. The likely cause of his condition is pneumonia, as seen on the CT scan of the chest. 

The patient is currently in the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction and respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). He has several medical complications, including shock (likely septic), pneumonia (treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin), hypoxic respiratory failure (secondary to pneumonia), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (now in normal sinus rhythm), troponin leak (likely secondary to demand ischemia), and a history of ethanol abuse.

The patient's current medications include vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and levophed. He is also receiving treatment for HAP and flu, and his blood cultures have been drawn.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate levels. His electrolytes are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium levels. His troponin T level is slightly elevated, and his arterial blood gas shows"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of neck cancer who presented with agitation, bleeding from the Foley site, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient was intubated at the outside hospital and remains pressor-dependent. The likely cause of shock is sepsis secondary to pneumonia, as seen on a CT scan of the chest. Other potential causes of shock include cardiogenic shock due to troponin leak and EKG changes, adrenal insufficiency, and hypovolemic shock.

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and influenza. He is also receiving vasopressin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine for blood pressure support. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia, and he did not tolerate weaning of ventilator settings after arrival from the emergency department. Serial arterial blood gases (ABGs) will be followed, and ventilator adjustments will be made as needed. The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may be considered for ARDS net criteria.

The patient was previously in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response but has since converted to normal sinus rhythm. Two attempts at cardioversion at the outside hospital were unsuccessful. Telemetry will continue, and no systemic anticoagulation is currently needed. If atrial fibrillation returns"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with agitation and pulmonary sepsis from a nursing facility. He is currently on multiple pressors including neo/vasopressin/levophed. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 99/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with bronchial breath sounds at the left base and scant crackles in the left upper lobe.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, including cefepime, vancomycin, and levofloxacin.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient likely has a pulmonary source of infection, with sputum showing gram-positive cocci in clusters. He remains on pressors and will be weaned off neo as MAP > 65 is maintained. Antibiotic coverage will continue, and an ultrasound chest will be performed to assess for effusion and potential source control.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has pneumonia with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 210, indicating severe respiratory failure. ARDS ventilation will be implemented with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted with agitation and pulmonary sepsis from a nursing facility. He is currently intubated and sedated, and is being treated with multiple vasopressors (vasopressin, norepinephrine, levophed) due to severe hypotension. The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, leading to the development of pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is evidence of a likely pulmonary source of infection, as indicated by bronchial breath sounds at the left base and scant crackles in the left upper lobe. The patient also has an elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to a pulmonary source, as suggested by the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters in the sputum. The ongoing use of vasopressors indicates that the patient remains hypotensive, putting him at risk for further complications such as organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to the development of ARDS. This condition is characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is low (210), indicating significant impairment in oxygenation. The patient may require more aggressive ventilatory support, including the use of"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M with recent dx of neck cancer at OSH who presented from rehab
   with aggitation, bleeding foley site, hypotension and afib with RVR.
   Intubated at OSH and remains pressor dependent.  Likely cause is PNA as
   seen on CT scan of chest.
   .
   # Shock: likely septic based on respiratory failure and PNA seen on CT
   scan.  Unclear etiology but should be treated for HAP because of recent
   hospitalization, as well as for possible flu.  Other causes on the
   differential include cardiogenic shock as he has a troponin leak and
   some ST changes on EKG.  Could be adrenal insufficiency, but less
   likely.  Did receive 10 mg IV decadron at OSH.
   - continue levophed, neo and vasopressin; wean neo first as tolerated
   today; goal MAP >60
   - follow lacates, central SVO2
   - PNA treatment for HAP with vanco/cefepime and change levoflox to
   cipro for better GN coverage
   - flu treatment with oseltamivir until ruled out
   .
   # PNA: treatment as above for HAP and flu.
   .
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: likely secondary to pneumonia, did not
   tolerate wean of vent settings after arrival from the ED.
   - follow serial ABGs, adjust vent as needed
   - ARDS net criteria
   - sedation with fent/versed
   .
   # Afib with RVR: now in normal sinus rhythm; failed two attempts at
   cardioversion at OSH.  No hx of afib per family.
   - continue telemetry
   - no need for systemic anticoagulation at this time
   - consider amio if afib returns
   .
   # Troponin leak: in the setting of afib with RVR is likely secondary to
   demand ischemia.  Cards looked at EKG in the ED without seeing need for
   further anticoagulation.  Received ASA rectally.
   - trend CEs
   - if rising, consider heparin gtt (if hct's stable)
   .
   # Coffee Ground emesis: unclear etiology; not known if patient taking
   NSAIDs, but does have hx of etoh abuse.  S/p one unit PRBCs in the ED
   with appropriate bump.
   - Hct q6hrs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - GI consult
   - guiac stools and emesis
   - if hct stable, start TFs
   .
   # Bleeding from foley: presented with aggitation and bleeding from
   foley, likely traumatic; urine draining clear but does have some blood
   at the meatus.
   - follow hcts
   - consider urology consult in AM
   .
   # Neck CA: newly diagnosed, will get records from OSH; unclear if
   treatment options are viable.  Will defer further treatment for now,
   has stable airway.
   - consider onc consult in AM
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continue levoxyl
   .
   # Dementia: unclear baseline, although per family is conversant at
   baseline.  Wean sedation as possible.
   .
   # Hx of ETOH abuse: do not know when last drink was or if patient has
   hx of seizures or withdrawl.
   - versed for sedation
   - LFTs show mild transaminitis
   .
   # PPX: SQ heparin, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel reg PRN
   # FEN: NPO for now
   # Access: CVL R IJ placed in ED [**1-10**]; PIVs
   # Communication: [**Name (NI) 5992**] [**Name (NI) 31**] HCP (see [**Name (NI) 2040**] for number)
   # Code: full confirmed with HCP
   # Dispo: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with recent diagnosis of neck cancer who presented from rehabilitation with agitation, bleeding from the Foley site, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was intubated at the outpatient setting and remains pressor dependent. The likely cause of his condition is pneumonia as seen on the chest CT scan.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock based on respiratory failure and pneumonia seen on the CT scan. Other possible causes include cardiogenic shock due to troponin leak and EKG changes, adrenal insufficiency, and hypovolemic shock from bleeding.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has pneumonia which may lead to further respiratory complications if not treated appropriately. Treatment includes antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and possible influenza.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure likely secondary to pneumonia. Ventilator settings need to be adjusted based on serial arterial blood gas (ABG) results.

4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (Afib with RVR): The patient had atrial fibrillation with RVR, but is now in normal sinus rhythm. Continuous telemetry should be followed, and systemic anticoagulation may be considered if Afib returns.

5. Troponin leak: The patient is experiencing a tropon"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of neck cancer, presenting with agitation, bleeding from the Foley site, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was intubated at the outside hospital and remains pressor-dependent. The likely cause of his condition is pneumonia, as seen on the CT scan of his chest.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Shock: The patient is improving and is now off vasopressin, with a plan to wean norepinephrine. This suggests that his shock state is resolving.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia and did not tolerate weaning of vent settings after arrival from the emergency department. The plan is to follow serial ABGs and adjust vent settings as needed. The ARDSnet criteria should be considered, and sedation with fentanyl and versed should be continued.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient's AFib with RVR has resolved into sinus rhythm. Telemetry should be continued, and systemic anticoagulation is not necessary at this time. Consideration should be given to amiodarone if AFib returns.

4. Troponin leak: The patient's troponin leak is likely due to demand. Holding aspirin is appropriate given the bleeding throat cancer.

   Intubated at OSH and remains pressor dependent.  Likely cause is PNA as
   seen on CT scan of chest.
   .
   # Shock: likely septic based on respiratory failure and PNA seen on CT
   scan.  Unclear etiology but should be treated for HAP because of recent
   hospitalization, as well as for possible flu.  Other causes on the
   differential include cardiogenic shock as he has a troponin leak and
   some ST changes on EKG.  Could be adrenal insufficiency, but less
   likely.  Did receive 10 mg IV decadron at OSH.
   - continue levophed, neo and vasopressin; wean neo first as tolerated
   today; goal MAP >60

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of neck cancer. He presented with agitation, bleeding from the Foley site, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient was intubated at the hospital and remains pressor dependent.

The assessment and plan indicate several potential medical complications:

1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock based on respiratory failure and pneumonia seen on the CT scan. Other possible causes include cardiogenic shock due to troponin leak and ST changes on the EKG, as well as adrenal insufficiency.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): Treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is being given with vancomycin and cefepime, and levofloxacin has been changed to cipro for better gram-negative coverage. Influenza treatment with oseltamivir is also being provided until ruled out.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient did not tolerate weaning of vent settings after arrival from the emergency department. Serial ABGs will be followed, and ventilation will be adjusted as needed. ARDSnet criteria will be followed.

4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (Afib with RVR): The patient is now in normal sinus rhythm after failed attempts at cardioversion. No history of atrial fibrillation was reported by the family. Telemetry will be continued, and systemic ant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with lobar pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has shown improvement in his respiratory failure and shock. The patient has a packed oral lesion and a small right-sided effusion. He is on multiple medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care. His vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pneumonia. Although he is tolerating spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) well in terms of ventilation and oxygenation, his mental status and moderate secretions are barriers to extubation. Close monitoring and evaluation by ENT for upper-airway lesion is necessary.
2. Shock: The patient had shock which is improving as the pressors are being weaned down. Levophed can be weaned off if the patient tolerates it, and vasopressin can be discontinued if levophed is stopped.
3. Healthcare-associated Pneumonia (HCAP): The patient is suspected to have HCAP. A complete course of vancomycin and cefepime is planned to treat this condition.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient has toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Mental status should be closely monitored and followed off sedation.
5. Oral Lesion: The patient has a packed oral lesion that needs to be evaluated and managed appropriately."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with lobar pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. He has shown improvement in terms of respiratory failure and shock. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His mental status is encephalopathic, likely due to infection and ICU stay. There is a suspected head and neck cancer contributing to the upper airway lesion. The patient's condition is stable, with decreasing pressor requirements and improving laboratory values. He has a DNR code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Measures are in place to prevent VAP, such as maintaining head-of-bed elevation and performing oral care with Peridex.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, including heparin, compression stockings, and leg elevation, are being implemented.
3. Nosocomial infection: The patient may be at risk for acquiring new infections during his ICU stay. Frequent monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and adherence to infection control practices will help minimize this risk.
4. Delirium: The patient's mental status is encephalopathic, and delirium is common in critically ill patients. Close monitoring of mental status and daily re-evaluation of sedation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with head and neck cancer who was admitted with sepsis secondary to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP). He is currently off pressors and extubated. The patient's condition is improving, with stable vital signs and no signs of hypoxemia. His white blood cell count is trending down, indicating improvement in the infection. The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he is able to breathe on his own. His shock has also resolved, and he is being monitored for any changes in blood pressure. The patient's oncology follow-up will be at [Location] hospital, and he will be followed up as an outpatient. He has experienced thrombocytopenia, with a drop in platelet count from 215 to 100 over the course of treatment. This may be partially dilutional due to aggressive volume resuscitation. Heparin has been temporarily discontinued to check for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). In terms of ICU care, the patient will receive speech and swallow consultation for his oropharyngeal lesion. Glycemic control will be maintained with a target glucose level below 150. Peripheral lines will be obtained, and the central venous line (CVL) will be discontinued if the patient's blood pressure is stable and able to obtain peripheral intravenous (PIV) access. Prophylaxis measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with head and neck cancer who was admitted with pneumonia and sepsis. He was intubated and on pressors but is now extubated and off pressors. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 110/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is awake and responsive with crackles at the right lower lung field and left base. His laboratory values show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 25.4 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of 0.31, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 154.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient self-extubated this morning but is currently stable without hypoxemia. Auto-diuresis should be allowed.
2. Shock: The patient's shock has resolved, but it is important to monitor his blood pressure and consider discontinuing the CVL if he is stable.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped from 215 to 100 over the course of treatment. Partially dilutional with aggressive volume resuscitation should be considered. Heparin should be temporarily discontinued, and the patient should be assessed for HIT (heparin-induced throm"
