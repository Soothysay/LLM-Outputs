   Assessment and Plan
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I: pt continues on heparin gtt.  Gap has
   closed so pt is no longer in DKA.
   - continue insulin gtt until taking reliable PO
   - switch to long acting once ready to come of gtt
   - consult [**Last Name (un) 276**] for new diagnosis of DM
   - SW consut for new diagnosis
   - nutrition C/S for diabetes nutrition recs
   - continue IVF hydration with D51/2 NS @ 333 cc/hr
   - monitor lytes Q8hr
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM): Trending down with IVF.
   -continue D5
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): No resolved, with
   creat back to normal.  Like was [**12-21**] pre-renal etiology.
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION: appears to be improving from yesterday. If does
   not clear as the DKA clears will need dedicated workup, but for now,
   appears to be attributable to DKA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. He was found to have high glucose, acidosis, and ketones consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient was started on an insulin drip and transferred to the ICU.

The patient received fluids and continued on the insulin drip overnight. He was confused but is now improving. He had an episode of vomiting this morning. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/59 mmHg to 163/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an ongoing fluid balance, with a total input of 1,697 mL and output of 430 mL. His blood products and urine output are also noted. The patient is not on respiratory support and has an ABG result of 7.42/34/106/24/-1.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake, alert, and oriented with intermittent mild confusion. He has chest crepitations bilaterally, regular heart sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm and dry skin, and no focal neurological findings.

Laboratory results show a blood glucose level of 145 mg/dL, sodium of 117 mEq/L, potassium of 2.8 mEq/L, chloride of 34.9%, bicarbonate of 9.9 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 23 mg/dL, and calcium of 8.2 mg/dL. Other labs include troponin-T of 289 U/L, CK of 289 U/L, CK-MB of 0.0%, and magnesium of 2.0 mg/dL.

Assessment and plan:
1) Diabetic Keto-acidosis: Continue insulin drip for now as still vomiting. Transition to subcutaneous when he tolerates PO.
2) Acute Renal Failure: Improving with intravenous fluid hydration.
3) Delirium: Likely secondary to DKA, now improving.
4) Tourette syndrome: Continue home medications.
5) Electrolyte abnormalities: Replace K+, electrolytes as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility.
- Stress ulcer due to the stress of the illness.
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) if the patient requires mechanical ventilation.
- Hypoglycemia if insulin therapy is not carefully managed.
- Electrolyte imbalances if electrolyte replacement is not properly monitored.
- Infection due to the patient's compromised immune system.
- Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction due to the stress on the heart.
- Further deterioration in renal function.
- Worsening of neurological status."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 20-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. He was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and started on an insulin drip. He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of DKA. During his stay, he received fluids and continued to improve, although he experienced an episode of vomiting. His vital signs remained stable, with controlled blood glucose levels. The patient's renal function showed improvement, and his delirium also improved. However, he was noted to have several medical complications, including acidosis, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, type I diabetes mellitus, and Tourette syndrome. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): DKA is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. It can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and organ damage if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Renal Failure: Acute renal failure is a sudden loss of kidney function, which can occur due to various reasons, including severe dehydration or complications from DKA. It can result in the buildup of waste products and toxins in the body.
3. Hypernatremia: Hypernatremia refers to high levels of sodium in the blood. In this case, it may be a result of dehydration associated with DKA. It can cause symptoms such as thirst, confusion, seizures, and even coma if left untreated.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: Metabolic acidosis is a condition characterized by an excess of acid in the body fluids. In the context of DKA, metabolic acidosis occurs due to the accumulation of ketones. If severe, it can lead to complications like cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure.
5. Delirium/Confusion: Delirium, also known as acute confusion state, is a sudden onset of confusion and disorientation. In this case, the patient's delirium is likely related to DKA and improved with treatment.
6. Tourette Syndrome: Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements and vocalizations. While not directly related to the current presentation, it is an existing condition that may require ongoing management.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient is at an increased risk of developing blood clots, especially due to immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as DVT prophylaxis are important to prevent complications like pulmonary embolism.
8. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient's critical condition and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Prophylactic medications are given to reduce this risk.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) Prophylaxis: VAP is a type of lung infection that can occur in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Prophylactic measures, such as proper oral hygiene and regular chest physiotherapy, can help prevent VAP."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU for a medical problem. The patient's chief complaint is an altered mental status and confusion. The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus and was found unconscious with a blood glucose level of 45 mg/dL, indicating hypoglycemia. The patient was resuscitated with IV fluids and given an intravenous dextrose infusion. Insulin was also started to control the patient's blood sugar levels. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 121/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 650 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient has a history of acute renal failure, possibly due to rhabdomyolysis as indicated by elevated creatine kinase levels. The patient's kidney function is further supported by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes show hypernatremia (high sodium) and hypokalemia (low potassium).

The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, while platelet count is within normal range. Liver enzymes are also within normal limits.

The patient's delirium and confusion may be attributed to the combination of hypog"

","The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of Tourette's syndrome who presented with 3 days of nausea and vomiting and was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has no prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM). He is currently being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU).

On 24-hour review, the patient's vital signs have stabilized, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 121/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood glucose levels have improved, but there were some fluctuations after transitioning from an insulin drip to subcutaneous insulin in the evening.

The patient's abdominal pain has resolved, and he no longer experiences nausea or vomiting. His mental status has also improved today. The patient's allergies, medical history, and family history are documented in the hospital records.

The patient is currently receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and has been on various ICU medications. His Foley catheter was removed today. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium (K+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), along with decreased levels of hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), and sodium (Na+).

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of Tourette's syndrome, who presented with three days of nausea and vomiting. He was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and required urgent medical attention. The patient's condition has improved, and he no longer experiences confusion or abdominal pain. His vital signs are stable, with normal blood pressure and heart rate. He is receiving insulin via subcutaneous injections instead of an insulin drip. His blood glucose levels are improving, but there were some fluctuations during the transition from the insulin drip to subcutaneous injections. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with clear breath sounds and an oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hyperglycemia: Despite improving, the patient may still experience high blood sugar levels due to the transition from IV to SC insulin. Close monitoring and adjustment of insulin doses will be necessary.
2. Hypoglycemia: Insulin therapy increases the risk of low blood sugar levels. The patient should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.
3. Infection: As the patient has been in the ICU, he may be at an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired infections. Monitoring for any signs of infection, such as fever or changes in wound healing, is essential.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient initially had a fluid deficit, which has been corrected with IV fluids. It is important to continue"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
- The patient's condition has improved, with resolution of acidosis, hypernatremia, renal failure, and delirium.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with normal temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
- The patient is well-nourished and alert, with no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems.
- Laboratory results show improvement in blood glucose levels, electrolytes, and kidney function.
- The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor and discharged soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reoccurrence of DKA: Although the patient's DKA has resolved, there is still a risk of future episodes if diabetes management is not maintained properly.
2. Hypoglycemia: As the patient is recovering from DKA, careful monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to prevent hypoglycemia.
3. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and use of IV lines can increase the risk of infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: Even though the patient's current electrolyte levels are within normal range, close monitoring is required to prevent imbalances during the transition from IV fluids to oral intake.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient had acute renal failure during the DKA episode, so ongoing monitoring of kidney function is essential to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was admitted with a chief complaint of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis). The patient's condition has improved, with resolution of acidosis, hypernatremia, renal failure, and delirium. The patient is now eating well without nausea and is ready for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: After resolving DKA, there is a risk of hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy and ongoing glucose monitoring should be maintained.
2. Infection: Despite resolution of delirium, the patient remains at risk for infections in the ICU setting. Close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures were taken for DVT, but the patient remains at risk. Regular assessment for symptoms of DVT should be performed.
4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: Although stress ulcer prophylaxis was initiated, the patient may still be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for any signs of bleeding is essential.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient was in the ICU, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for respiratory symptoms and infection control practices should be continued.
6. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Although the patient's renal failure has resolved, there is a possibility of AKI due to previous hypotension and fluid management. Regular"
