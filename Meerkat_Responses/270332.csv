   hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Given history of OSA and COPD likely combination
   of hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. Etiology unclear but
   given vague symptoms of cough and congestion this could be a viral URI
   which exacerbated underlying respiratory disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN, DMII, and OSA who presented with shortness of breath and lower extremity swelling. He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has decreased breath sounds with crackles at the bases, bilateral pedal edema, and a rash with red, flat macules and petechiae on his abdomen, back, and legs. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, high potassium, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient is currently on several medications including levofloxacin, albuterol/atropine nebs, Lasix, and metformin, among others. The plan includes treating respiratory failure with bipap, monitoring for dizziness/lightheadedness, managing diabetes and hypertension, addressing CAD, transitioning to CPAP for OSA, and providing nutritional support once oxygenations improve. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and OSA, which increases the risk for respiratory failure. His current condition of hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure needs to be closely monitored and managed.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient's diabetes is well-controlled according to his most recent HbA1C level, the elevated blood glucose levels"

   .
   # respiratory failure: combined hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory
   failure. Etiology unclear.  Chronically elevated Hct suggests some
   level of chronic hypoxia, likely d/t combination of COPD and OSA. pH of
   7.3 with pCO2 of 82 suggests chronic respiratory acidosis with
   metabolic compensation. BL pCO2 likely ~ 70. Unclear cause of current
   decline.  No prodrome of fevers or myalgias to suggest flu. No obvious
   infection on CXR to suggest profound pna. Increased LE edema and
   elevated BNP raises ? of CHF. ? ischemic contribution. MBI elevated but
   ECG without dramatic ischemic changes and trop normal. Could also have
   COPD exacerbation in setting of infection.

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show tachypnea, low blood pressure, and decreased peripheral pulses. The physical examination reveals an overweight and obese appearance, diminished breath sounds, and petechiae-like red dots on the lower legs. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated troponin T, and abnormal kidney function. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has combined hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure, with an unclear etiology. There is evidence of chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation, as indicated by the elevated hemoglobin level. The cause of the current decline is uncertain, but possibilities include congestive heart failure (CHF), an ischemic contribution, or a COPD exacerbation in the setting of infection.

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 49-year-old man with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute on chronic. He presented with increasing shortness of breath, decreased oxygen saturation, and decreased oral intake. Initial treatment included lasix, asa, levo, and oxygen, but he had decompensation with desaturation, prompting placement on CPAP 20. The patient was brought to the MICU.

The patient's medical history includes OSA, COPD, CAD with previous IMI and OM stent, as well as a family history of COPD in the father and heart disease in a sister. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the addition of increased sputum production and cough.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate are stable within normal limits. However, his oxygen saturation is at 88%. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a set tidal volume of 0-501 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.26, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) at 116 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 40 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) at 88%.

   hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Given history of OSA and COPD likely combination
   of hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. Etiology unclear but
   given vague symptoms of cough and congestion this could be a viral URI

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN, DMII, and OSA who presented with shortness of breath and leg swelling. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation, BIPAP, and has shown improvement. His vital signs are stable, but he has decreased breath sounds with crackles at the bases of his lungs and bilateral pedal edema. The patient also has a rash over his abdomen, back, and legs, as well as scattered petechiae on his upper arms and legs/feet. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of OSA and COPD increases the risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate management to maintain adequate blood pressure is necessary.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload with leg edema and decreased breath sounds. Strict input/output monitoring and diuretic therapy may be required to manage fluid balance.
4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection. Cultures should be obtained, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on the results."

   a properly fitting mask. His barrier to d/c is his frequent
   apneic/desat episodes during sleep and while awake and eating or

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not explicitly stated. However, the patient has been experiencing several medical complications.

The patient's recent events include non-invasive ventilation being stopped, a trans-thoracic echo performed, and the use of BIPAP due to a desaturation event. The patient was also on non-invasive ventilation and improved.

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, with an acute exacerbation. They also have heart failure (CHF), specifically acute systolic CHF. Additionally, the patient is experiencing respiratory acidosis and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure (89/57 mmHg), high respiratory rate (19 breaths per minute), and low oxygen saturation (89%). Their heart rhythm is normal (sinus rhythm). The fluid balance shows an input of 1,319 mL and output of 2,701 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,382 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and blood glucose levels. Other lab values, such as hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, and arterial blood gas (ABG) parameters, are within normal ranges or stable.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to the lack of assessments in several areas, including"

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (CHF), and impaired skin integrity. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of COPD and acute decompensated heart failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/78 mmHg to 129/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85% on a nasal cannula.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) with apnea pressure. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 60%, and the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is at 5 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 69 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 41 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hematocrit (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Kidney function tests reveal a creatinine (Cr) level of 0."

   Assessment and Plan
   49 year old male with COPD (FEV1 1.7 [**3-16**]), CAD, HTN, DMII, OSA on CPAP
   who presents with SOB and LE swelling transferred to the unit for
   hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to viral URI which exhausted
   patients limited baseline reserve; underlying OSA and COPD and baseline
   O2 requirement appear to slowly be getting worse, possibly due to his
   non-compliance with wearing bipap at home. It would benefit him to
   attend inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation and repeat a sleep study to
   establish what his new bipap requirements are, as well as be fitted for
   a properly fitting mask. His barrier to d/c is his frequent
   apneic/desat episodes during sleep and while awake and eating or
   talking. It may be that he lives at a much lower CO2 at baseline. Given
   his very elevated hct, it was discussed w/the patient that it would
   significantly benefit him to use his bipap and O2 at home.
   - levofloxacin 750 mg x 5 day course (day 3 today)
   - albuterol/atrovent nebs
   - lasix prn, although pt is clinically euvolemic
   - po prednisone 60mg qd with slow taper (10 days)
   - strict I/Os, daily weights, goal negative -500cc/d
   - bipap w/ new settings prior to d/c
   - touch base with his pulmonologist and PCP to evaluate which types of
   treatment will work best for him
   - clinically much improved, no need to follow ABGs at this point
   -physical therapy, up and walking
   .
   # Dizziness/lightheadedness: Likely secondary to hypercarbia given poor
   compliance with bipap at home. Resolved

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN, and DMII, presenting with shortness of breath and lower extremity swelling. He was transferred to the ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to viral upper respiratory infection (URI), which exhausted his limited baseline reserve. Underlying OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) and COPD are also contributing to his respiratory failure. Non-compliance with wearing BiPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) at home may be worsening his condition.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to viral URI, underlying OSA, and COPD. It would benefit him to attend inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation and repeat a sleep study to establish new BiPAP requirements and be fitted for a properly fitting mask. His frequent apneic/desat episodes during sleep and while awake and eating or talking may indicate that he lives at a much lower CO2 at baseline. Using BiPAP and O2 at home can significantly benefit him.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obesity who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to exacerbation of COPD. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV+ApneaPres mode. Oxygen delivery is via a nasal cannula with a FiO2 of 60%. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 69, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 142.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished but is in acute distress, with snoring and periods of apnea. There is evidence of periorbital edema and lip swelling. Breath sounds are clear, but diminished at the bases, with referred upper airway sounds. The patient has trace upper extremity edema. Skin is warm and dry, with small erythematous nonblanching macules on the lower abdomen.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 122/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85% on the nasal cannula.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.0 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 18.1 g/dL, mildly elevated blood glucose of 121 mg/dL, and slightly low potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,230 mL and a total output of 1,261 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -969 mL. The patient's urine output is 2,230 mL.

The patient's current medications include Levofloxacin, which was last administered at 10:00 AM on [**2193-1-10**].

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and glycemic control issues due to high blood glucose levels."

   49 year old male with COPD (FEV1 1.7 [**3-16**]), CAD, HTN, DMII, OSA on CPAP
   who presents with SOB and LE swelling transferred to the unit for
   hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Combination of fluid overload, COPD exacerbation
   and OSA. Working on placement in pulmonary rehabilitation as either
   inpatient or outpatient. He is currently on 6L NC and refusing to wear
   the bipap bc it is uncomfortable. Pending he is able to be weaned off
   to a lower O2 requirement he may be able to go to the floor today. PCP
   has been notified and is working on getting outpatient pulmonary
   rehabilitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN, DMII, and OSA. He presented with shortness of breath and lower extremity swelling and was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is currently on 6 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and refusing to wear a BiPAP mask due to discomfort. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 122/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. Physical examination reveals snoring with periods of apnea, periorbital edema, and poor dentition. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin and platelet count. The patient has been prescribed levofloxacin, albuterol nebs, lasix, and other medications for his conditions. The plan is to continue respiratory support, work towards weaning off oxygen, and consider placement in pulmonary rehabilitation either inpatient or outpatient."

   Assessment and Plan
   49 year old male with COPD (FEV1 1.7 [**3-16**]), CAD, HTN, DMII, OSA on CPAP
   who presents with SOB and LE swelling transferred to the unit for
   hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Combination of fluid overload, COPD exacerbation
   and OSA. Working on pulmonary outpatient rehabilitation.  He is
   currently on 4L O2 NC and sats are in high 80s to 90s while sitting in
   bed. PT/OT has seen him yesterday- it is likely that he will need to be
   re-evaluated for the oxygen settings he wears at home. As for OSA,
   since none of the masks have fit him, other options may include a
   stimulant or surgery. However, he is followed closely as an outpatient
   in sleep clinic who know him well, and will be able to assess what
   would work for him best. At this time, we will continue to treat  his
   underlying PNA (last day of abx is today), COPD with inhalers and fluid
   overload with lasix.
   - levofloxacin
 last day today

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN, DMII, and OSA. He presented with shortness of breath and lower extremity swelling, leading to respiratory failure due to a combination of fluid overload, COPD exacerbation, and OSA. The patient is currently receiving oxygen via nasal cannula and has been treated for pneumonia. He is also being managed for diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The plan is to continue with pulmonary rehabilitation and adjust oxygen settings. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and he may be ready for discharge to the floor if he tolerates 3-4L O2 NC.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory issues, such as COPD exacerbation and OSA, can lead to continued respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's current fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating that he is losing more fluid than he is receiving. However, this needs to be closely monitored to prevent further fluid overload.
3. Infection: Although the patient has been treated for pneumonia, there is still a risk of infection due to his compromised respiratory status and potential exposure in the ICU.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and hypertension puts him at risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (CHF), and respiratory acidosis. The patient has impaired aerobic capacity, respiration/gas exchange, and knowledge. There are no known drug allergies.

24-hour events:
- The patient received a dose of levofloxacin at 10:00 AM.
- Heparin sodium was administered at 09:31 PM for prophylaxis.
- Other ICU medications were given as per the flow sheet data.

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.5°F)
- Heart rate: 89 bpm (range: 67-93 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 103/45 mmHg (range: 84/45-151/91 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (range: 14-26 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 89%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

Fluid balance:
- Total input: 1,542 mL
- Total output: 5,300 mL (including 1,725 mL of urine output)

Respiratory support:
- Oxygen delivery device: Nasal cannula
- SpO2: 89%
- ABG: pH 7.38

- Cr: 0.8 mg/dL
- TropT: 0.05 (range: 0.02-0.02 ng/mL)
- TCO2: 39 (range: 43 mEq/L)
- Glucose: 165 mg/dL
- Other labs: Refer to the lab values provided

Assessment and plan:
- AERobic capacity/endurance: Impaired
- RESPIRATION/gas exchange: Impaired
- KNOWLEDGE: Impaired
- CHRONIC obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema: With acute exacerbation
- HEART failure (CHF), systolic, acute
- ACIDOSIS, respiratory
- IMPAIRED skin integrity

ICU care:
- Nutrition: 
- Glycemic control:
- Lines: 18 Gauge
- Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: Due to impaired respiration/gas exchange and prolonged immobilization.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to prolonged bed rest and impaired mobility.
3. Stress ulcers: Due to the stress of acute illness and medications.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to mechanical ventilation and impaired respiratory function.
5. Worsening heart failure: Due to the patient's pre-existing condition and acute exacerbation.
6. Hypotension: Due to low blood pressure readings.
7. Hyperglycemia: Due to impaired glycemic control.
8. Renal impairment: Due to decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels.
9. Skin breakdown: Due to impaired skin integrity and prolonged immobilization."
