","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, hypoxemia, fever of unknown origin, and chest pain. The patient has a history of smoking, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. On admission, the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory distress. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 103.5Â°F, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 82/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels, decreased urine output, and signs of renal dysfunction. Imaging studies reveal diffuse right lung opacities consistent with pneumonia. The patient's medical history and current presentation suggest a possible diagnosis of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), sepsis, and multi-drug resistant pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and signs of organ dysfunction (renal failure, respiratory failure) suggest a systemic infection leading to sepsis. Prompt antibiotic therapy and source control are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure and diffuse right lung opacities may progress to ARDS, characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral"

   Assessment and Plan
   Resp failure: Likely CAP with disease involving entire R lung.
   Currently with [**Doctor Last Name 2**] based on gas.
   - continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - decrease vent settings
   - sputum cx
   - Bronch today
   Hypotension:  Will need a-line and CVL today.
   - Bolusing now as low UOP
   - Check CVPs when CVL placed
   - goal MAP>60, CVP>8
   A-fib with RVR/History of CAD: Biomarkers negative this AM.  Chest pain
   and ECG changes resolved with rate control.
   - Holding BB until hypotension resolved
   - Would favor esmolol gtt for quick on/off if he develops RVR again.
   ARF: Likely pre-renal given low UOP, but may be intrinsic renal (ATN)
   or AIN related.
   - fluid bolus now
   - send urine lytes
   - Renal U/S

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure due to likely community-acquired pneumonia involving the entire right lung, hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and a history of coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient has been experiencing fever, increased heart rate, low blood pressure, and decreased urine output. He has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 103.5Â°F, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 82/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia involving the entire right lung. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the infection progresses or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tension pneumothorax.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to septic shock secondary to the infection or inadequate"

   # Resp failure: Likely CAP with disease involving entire R lung.
   Currently with [**Doctor Last Name 2**] based on gas.
   - continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - decrease vent settings as tolerated
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Bronch today
   .
   # Metabolic non-gap acidosis: Patient with pH of 7.30 this am, nl PCO2.
   Consider [**1-13**] to renal failure.
   - Increase respiratory rate to compensate
   .
   # ARF: Renal consulted and suggests ARF related to multiple myeloma as
   urine sediment not consistent with intrinsic renal (ATN). Also consider
   AIN related.  Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.  Rapidly worsening
   overnight with minimal UOP
   - F/u Renal recs
   .
   # pancytopenia - at her baseline currently, WBC trended up slightly
   2.3->3.1.
   - trend CBC.
   .
   # chest pain - h/o CAD s/p left LAD stent. ECG with some dynamic t-wave
   changes, ruled out prior to being called out of MICU, now s/p 2nd
   episode of chest pain which per notes responded to SL NTG.
   - continue aspirin, metoprolol, lipitor.
   - cycle CE x 2 sets.
   - repeat ECG in AM.
   - goal HCT > 30 if evidence of ischemia.
   .
   # atrial fibrillation - currently in afib, on coumadin, though CHADs=1.
   s/p PPM for sick sinus syndrome.  metoprolol dose increased to 25mg po
   tid on [**5-24**].
   - hold metoprolol for now given ?hypotension, if [**Last Name (LF) 991**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] treat with
   IVF prn UOP>30cc/hr, and consider cautiously reintroducing metoprolol
   12.5mg prn for goal HR 60s.
   - hold coumadin, goal INR >2.0.
   .
   # h/o PE - remote per pt, on coumadin, though this could be for afib.
   negative v/q upon admission.
   - hold coumadin pending possible bronch in AM.
   .
   # anemia - baseline hct ~24, attributed to myeloma and CLL.  no
   evidence of significant ischemia on ECG presently, so will hold off on
   further transfusion.  HCT currently 26.
   - transfuse for HCT > 30 if evidence of ischemia, otherwise >21.
   - trend HCT.
   - continue folate, iron, b12 repletion.
   .
   # multipe myeloma - long standing, failed alkeran/prednisone, started
   on velcade on [**2116-5-14**], followed at [**Company 1794**].
   - hold velcade for now.
   .
   # CLL - baseline WBC 2.0-2.3 over last year. currently at baseline.

   A-fib with RVR/History of CAD: Biomarkers negative.  Chest pain and ECG
   changes resolved with rate control.
   - Holding BB until hypotension resolved
   - Would favor esmolol gtt for quick on/off if he develops RVR again.
   Chronic DVTs: on coumadin
   - Hold coumadin now

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PE, and multiple myeloma. He was admitted to the ICU for presumed CAP and now presents with persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension. The patient has been transferred back to the MICU from another hospital. He has a recent history of chest pain, atrial fibrillation, and anemia. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 103.5Â°F, heart rate of 120s, blood pressure of 80s/45mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fever and hypotension - most concerning for septic picture. CXR shows pneumonia involving the entire right lung, concerning for ARDS. Lactate remains normal, but with metabolic acidosis and minimal urine output. Hypotensive overnight requiring pressors. A-line/CVL placed.
   - Continue vancomycin.
   - Maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >55, central venous pressure (CVP) >12.
   - Follow up with urine culture, sputum culture, blood culture.
   - Wean pressors as tolerated.

2. Respiratory failure: Likely CAP with disease involving entire right lung. Currently with [Doctor Last Name 2] based on gas exchange.
   - Continue vancomycin.
   - Decrease vent settings as tolerated.
   - Follow up with sputum culture.
   - Bronchoscopy today.

3. Metabolic non-gap acidosis: Patient with pH of 7.30 this morning, normal PCO2. Consider renal failure.
   - Increase respiratory rate to compensate.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): Renal consulted and suggests ARF related to multiple myeloma as urine sediment not consistent with intrinsic renal (ATN). Also consider AIN related. Renal U/S without hydronephrosis. Rapidly worsening overnight with minimal urine output.
   - Follow up with renal recommendations.

5. Pancytopenia - at her baseline currently, WBC trended up slightly 2.3->3.1.
   - Trend CBC.

6. Chest pain - history of CAD s/p left LAD stent. ECG with some dynamic T-wave changes, ruled out earlier in hospitalization. Chest pain appeared to resolve with rate control.
   - Continue aspirin, metoprolol, lipitor.
   - Cycle CE x 2 sets.
   - Goal hematocrit (HCT) > 30 if evidence of ischemia.

7. Atrial fibrillation - currently in afib, on coumadin for h/o PE, though CHADS=1. s/p PPM for sick sinus syndrome. Metoprolol dose increased to 25mg po tid"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PE, and recently transferred to the MICU with presumed CAP. He is now back in the ICU for persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension. The patient has septic shock with MOF, likely CAP involving the entire right lung, concern for ARDS. He has metabolic acidosis, minimal urine output, hypotension overnight requiring pressors, and an arterial line/CVL placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis and septic shock due to presumed CAP.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to lung involvement.
3. Metabolic non-gap acidosis, possibly related to renal failure.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF) related to multiple myeloma or AIN.
5. Atrial fibrillation, currently in afib, on coumadin for h/o PE.
6. Anemia due to myeloma and CLL.
7. Potential empyema, as evidenced by febrile and shock states.
8. Possible thromboembolic events, given h/o PE and atrial fibrillation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PE, and multiple myeloma. He was admitted to the MICU with presumed CAP and later transferred back to the ICU due to persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension. The patient tested positive for influenza A and had infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating ARDS. He also had an anuria and metabolic acidosis, which suggested septic shock with multi-organ failure.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension, indicating sepsis. His laboratory results showed leukopenia and positive influenza A, suggesting an infectious cause for the sepsis.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's chest X-ray showed infiltrates involving the entire right lung, and his P:F ratio was 163, which is suggestive of ARDS. This condition resulted in respiratory failure.
3. Anuria: The patient experienced anuria, which means no urine output. This could be due to renal failure or other factors such as dehydration or obstruction.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had a metabolic acidosis, likely related to renal failure or sepsis.
5. Hypotension: The patient required pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg, indicating persistent hyp"

","The patient is a 70-inch-old male admitted to the ICU with worsening multi-organ dysfunction. He has a history of acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure not consistent with ARDS, atrial fibrillation, fever of unknown origin, chest pain, and hypoxemia.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38.5 C (101.3 F), heart rate of 83 bpm with a range of 75-129 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/55 mmHg to 132/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 25, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 13 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

The patient has been receiving multiple vasopressors including vasopressin and Neo to maintain blood pressure. His extremities are mottled with barely detectable pulses. The arterial line is dampened, so cuff pressures are being used for titration.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 60 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, potassium level of 5.8 mg/dL, sodium level of 105 mEq/L, and lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L. Other lab results include elevated creat"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch-old male with multiple medical problems, including acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation, fever of unknown origin, chest pain, and other conditions. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.5 C (101.3 F), heart rate between 75-129 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 72/45 mmHg to 132/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is irregularly irregular due to atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating between 85 and 206 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate possible kidney dysfunction and liver enzymes abnormalities.

The patient's chest x-ray shows crackles on the right side and clear lung fields on the left side. Physical examination findings include mottled bilateral lower extremities with barely dopplerable pulses, crackles on the right side, and clear lung fields on the left side.

The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, vasopressin, phenylephrine, lansoprazole, met"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, PE, and recent transfer from the MICU for presumed CAP. He was transferred back to the MICU due to persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock and multi-organ failure, confirmed by positive influenza A and CXR showing infiltrates involving the entire right lung with a P:F ratio suggestive of ARDS. He also has metabolic acidosis, anuria, and hypotension requiring pressors. The family has made the decision to continue comfort measures only, but with the exception of ventilatory support, as they believe extubation would hasten death. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 74/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on endotracheal tube ventilation with FiO2 at 50%. His blood work shows elevated levels of creatinine and lactate, but normal WBC count. The patient is receiving morphine for comfort and has a multi-lumen line, arterial line, and is on fiber nutrition. His disposition is currently in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   84M with h/o COPD, CAD, PE, recently transferred out of the MICU with
   presumed CAP, now transferred back to the MICU for persistent fevers,
   tachypnea, and hypotension.
   .
   # Septic Shock with multi-organ failure: Influenza A positive with CXR
   showing infiltrates involving entire R lung with P:F ratio 163
   suggestive of ARDS. Lactate remains normal, but with metabolic acidosis
   and anuria. Hypotensive requiring pressors.
   - Concerned for empyema as continues to be febrile and continues to
   have shock but [**Female First Name (un) 231**] not consistent with goals of care
   - Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/oseltamivir
   - F/u pending UCx, Sputum Cx, BCx, bronch cultures.
   - Cont vasopressin and neo to maintain MAP>55, CVP>12
   # Resp failure: Influenza A with disease involving entire R lung and as
   above concern for empyema.  Currently with ARDS based on P:F ratio.
   - Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/oseltamivir
   - Decrease PEEP as tolerated; maintain Tv at goal 6 ml/kg
   - F/u sputum cx and bronch cultures
   - Try lying on left side to aerate diseased lung better
   - Thoracentesis not consistent with goals of care
   # Leukopenia: Immunocompromised in setting of multiple myeloma and now
   with overwhelming infection.
   - Neutropenic precautions pending diff
   - Cont above abx and supportive care
   - F/u cx
   - PCP and oncologist updated and confirm worsening multiple myeloma
   # Metabolic non-gap acidosis: Worsening acidosis; likely [**1-13**] to renal
   failure.
   # ARF: Likely related to multiple myeloma as urine sediment not
   consistent with intrinsic renal (ATN). Also consider AIN related.
   Renal U/S without hydronephrosis.  Rapidly worsening overnight with
   minimal UOP
   - F/u Renal recs
   - Unable to transition off neo despite vasopressin
   - CVVH not c/w goals of care
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - Phos binders
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently in afib, on coumadin at home for h/o
   PE, though CHADs=1. S/p PPM for sick sinus syndrome which is
   functioning but not capturing while in Afib per EP.
   - Appreciate EP recs
   - Holding metoprolol given hypotension
   - Hold coumadin; rising INR likely [**1-13**] end-organ damage
   - Using vasopressin/neo for pressors
   # Anemia: Stable. Baseline Hct ~24, attributed to myeloma and CLL. No
   evidence of significant ischemia on ECG presently and appears slightly
   volume overloaded, so will hold off on further transfusion.
   - Transfuse for HCT >21
   - Trend HCT
   - Continue folate, iron, b12 repletion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and PE, who was recently transferred to the ICU for persistent fevers, tachypnea, and hypotension. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS and has a confirmed diagnosis of influenza A. The patient also has multiple myeloma, which has led to immunocompromisation and neutropenia. He has been experiencing septic shock with multi-organ failure, including renal failure. The patient's vitals are stable, but he remains hypotensive and requires vasopressors. His blood cultures are pending, and he is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, tachypnea, hypotension, and leukopenia indicate a potential ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics are essential.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio and the involvement of the entire right lung on chest X-ray suggest ARDS. This condition can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly. Continuing with low tidal volume ventilation and careful fluid management are crucial.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels, anuria, and worsening renal function indicate potential renal failure. Frequent assessment of renal parameters"
