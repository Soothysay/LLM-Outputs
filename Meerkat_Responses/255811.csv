   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 2568**] is a 52 year-old male with a history of dilated
   cardiomyopathy with who presents with fever, hypotension, and diarrhea.
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially concerning for SIRS/sepsis given that patient
   was febrile and tachypneic with a leukocytosis.  Symptoms have since
   resolved and patient has been hemodynamically stable overnight. Patient
   had one BM overnight that was not diarrhea, as well as one episode of
   emesis just prior to BM.  Hypotension likely intravascular volume
   depletion from gastroenteritis that is now resolved in setting of
   patient with significant systolic heart failure.
   - Monitor VS
   - Continue levofloxacin/flagyl x24 hours pending culture data.  Will
   plan to discontinue tomorrow if cultures negative.
   - C. diff x3, patient had one BM overnight, unable to collect sample
   due to inadequate volume.
   .
   # Dilated cardiomyopathy: Patient followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of
   cardiology.  TTE yesterday demonstrates EF of 20%, significant RA and
   [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2569**], and left to right shunt.  Metoprolol restarted
   yesterday.
   - Continue ASA, statin, metoprolol
   - Hold ACE-I and lasix
   - Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]/cardiology regarding etiology (viral
   myocarditis?) and possible transplant.
   - CK elevated since last admission, question if this is related to
   myocarditis, will check ESR/CRP.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Patient with new hyponatremia today to 131, likely due
   to both intravascular volume depletion and CHF.
   - Trend chemistries
   - Free water restriction of 1L
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Patient with elevated PT, aPTT, and INR initially
   concerning for DIC given sepsis picture.  Peripheral smear negative for
   schistocytes, likely represents underlying chronic liver disease or
   congestive hepatopathy as patient also with elevated transaminases.
   - Trend coags
   .
   # SVT: Patient continues to have HR>100.  Restarted on metoprolol
   yesterday to 37.5 mg tid.
   - Increase to 50 mg po tid.
   - Consider digoxin
   .
   # Anemia: guaiac negative x 2.  baseline hct 39-42, now 33.2.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient presents with fever, hypotension, and diarrhea. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially had symptoms consistent with sepsis, including fever, tachypnea, and leukocytosis. However, the symptoms have since resolved, and the patient has been hemodynamically stable overnight.

2. Intravascular volume depletion: The patient's hypotension is likely due to intravascular volume depletion from gastroenteritis. This has since resolved.

3. Significant systolic heart failure: The patient has a severely dilated left ventricle with severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 20%. This indicates significant systolic heart failure.

4. Mitral regurgitation: The patient has severe (4+) mitral regurgitation, which may contribute to his heart failure symptoms.

5. Tricuspid regurgitation: The patient also has severe (4+) tricuspid regurgitation.

6. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient has a known history of dilated cardiomyopathy. The recent TTE demonstrates an EF of 20%, significant RA dilation, and a left-to-right shunt.

7. Hyponatremia: The patient has developed hyponatremia with a level"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy. He presents with fever, hypotension, and diarrhea. The patient initially had symptoms consistent with SIRS/sepsis but has since resolved and has been hemodynamically stable overnight. The hypotension is likely due to intravascular volume depletion from gastroenteritis, which has now resolved in the setting of significant systolic heart failure.

The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy and was followed by a cardiologist. A TTE yesterday demonstrated an EF of 20%, significant RA and LA dilation, a left-to-right shunt, and severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. The patient's medications include ASA, statin, metoprolol, and furosemide, which will be continued or restarted as appropriate.

The patient also has hyponatremia, likely due to both intravascular volume depletion and CHF. Coagulopathy is present, likely representing underlying chronic liver disease. Anemia is also noted, with a baseline hct of 39-42, now 33.2. Trending of chemistries, coags, and hct is recommended.

Additionally, the patient has elevated PT, aPTT, and INR, initially concerning for DIC, but peripheral smear negative for schistocytes. The patient's kidney function"

   Imaging: TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium
   is markedly dilated. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
   septum is seen at rest. A secundum type atrial septal defect is
   present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free
   wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
   mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt. Severe (4+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
   suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
   pressure. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 2568**] is a 52 year-old male with a history of dilated
   cardiomyopathy with who presents with fever, hypotension, and diarrhea.
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially concerning for SIRS/sepsis given that patient
   was febrile and tachypneic with a leukocytosis.  Symptoms have since
   resolved and patient has been hemodynamically stable overnight. Patient
   had one BM overnight that was not diarrhea, as well as one episode of
   emesis just prior to BM.  Hypotension likely intravascular volume
   depletion from gastroenteritis that is now resolved in setting of
   patient with significant systolic heart failure.
   - Monitor VS
   - Discontinue levofloxacin/flagyl
   - C. diff x3, patient had one BM overnight, unable to collect sample
   due to inadequate volume.

   # Dilated cardiomyopathy: Patient followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of
   cardiology.  TTE yesterday demonstrates EF of 20%, significant RA and
   [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2569**], and left to right shunt.  Metoprolol restarted
   yesterday.  CXR this AM demonstrates worsening pulmonary edema, likely
   secondary to +4L net balance during hospital course.
   - Continue ASA, statin, metoprolol
   - Restart furosemide if hemodynamically stable
   - Continue to hold ACE-I
   - Follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]/cardiology

   # Hyponatremia: Patient with new hyponatremia today to 131, likely due
   to both intravascular volume depletion and CHF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy who presents with fever, hypotension, and diarrhea. The patient's symptoms have resolved overnight, and he has been hemodynamically stable. However, he has experienced hypotension likely due to intravascular volume depletion from gastroenteritis. 

The patient has a known diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy and is being followed by a cardiologist. His echocardiogram demonstrates an ejection fraction of 20%, significant right atrial and ventricular dilation, and a left-to-right shunt. Metoprolol was restarted yesterday, and his chest X-ray shows worsening pulmonary edema likely secondary to fluid overload during the hospital course.

The patient also has hyponatremia, which is likely due to both intravascular volume depletion and congestive heart failure. Coagulopathy is present with elevated PT, aPTT, and INR, but there are no schistocytes seen on peripheral smear, suggesting underlying chronic liver disease rather than disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Anemia is also noted, and follow-up iron studies should be done.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and electrolyte imbalances. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and response to treatment. Additionally, the patient's cardiac function should be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, who presents with fever, hypotension, and diarrhea. He meets the criteria for sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's symptoms have since resolved, and he has been hemodynamically stable overnight. The differential includes transient gastroenteritis associated with hypovolemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and diarrhea indicates sepsis. If not properly managed, sepsis can progress to septic shock, which can be life-threatening.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%. This condition puts him at risk for exacerbations of heart failure, which can lead to further hypotension and fluid accumulation.
3. Anemia: The patient's iron studies are consistent with anemia of chronic disease. If left untreated, anemia can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potentially worsen organ dysfunction.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient initially had elevated PT, aPTT, and INR, which could be concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Although the peripheral smear was negative for schistocytes, indicating no evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, the elevated liver enzymes suggest congestive hepatopathy. Monitoring of coagulation parameters should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) due to viral myocarditis. He was admitted with fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hypotension, likely related to hypovolemia and viral gastroenteritis. The patient's hypotension resolved after two days, and there are no ongoing signs of infection. His diarrhea also resolved. The patient has severe CHF with an ejection fraction of 20%. He is currently on milrinone as per cardiology, and efforts are being made to maximize lopressor. The plan is to discuss with cardiology regarding the initiation of an ACE inhibitor and diuresis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 92/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula, and atrial fibrillation heart rhythm. The patient is fluid overloaded, as indicated by crackles at the base of the lungs and mild hypoxemia. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis, pantoprazole for stress ulcers, and aspirin for secondary prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) today for further management of his low ejection fraction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated heart failure: The patient's history of severe CHF and current symptoms, including crackles at the base of the lungs and fluid overload, suggest a high risk for acute decompensated heart failure. Monitoring fluid intake and output, optimizing medications, and considering diuretic therapy may help prevent further decompensation.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation. This can be a common complication in patients with CHF and may lead to further cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring of the heart rhythm and appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy may be necessary.
3. Infection: Although the patient's infectious symptoms have resolved, there is still a risk of developing new infections while in the ICU. Proper hand hygiene, appropriate use of antibiotics, and surveillance for signs of infection are essential to prevent healthcare-associated infections.
4. Thromboembolism: Due to the patient's immobilization and underlying CHF, he is at an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prophylactic heparin is being given to reduce this risk, but continued monitoring and early detection of any signs of VTE are crucial.
5. Medication adverse effects: The patient is on multiple medications, including milrinone, lopressor, and aspirin. Monitoring for any potential adverse effects, such as hypotension or arrhythmias, is important to ensure the patient's safety and optimize the therapeutic benefits of these medications."

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy. He presents with fever, hypotension, and diarrhea. The patient has been diagnosed with heart failure and hypotension, likely secondary to intravascular volume depletion rather than sepsis. He has been hemodynamically stable, culture negative, and antimicrobials were discontinued yesterday.

The patient's cardiomyopathy/heart failure is significant, with systolic dysfunction and significant tricuspid regurgitation/mild mitral regurgitation. He has been started on milrinone and has also been titrated up on metoprolol. Lasix gtt was started yesterday, but due to significant diuresis, it was held. The patient continues to diurese and has a net loss of 1.3 liters since midnight.

Other assessments and plans include atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, hyponatremia, anemia, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 110/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including ASA, statin, metoprolol, milrinone, lasix, and ACE-I. Further follow-up with Dr. [First Name (STitle)] is planned"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy. He presents with fever, hypotension, and diarrhea. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/65 to 92/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate intravascular volume depletion rather than sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs is necessary to ensure hemodynamic stability.

2. Cardiomyopathy/heart failure: The patient has significant systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20% and significant tricuspid regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. He is being treated with milrinone and metoprolol. Continued monitoring and management of his heart condition are crucial.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, and rate control is being maintained with metoprolol. ASA and rate control measures should be continued.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT, aPTT, and INR, which initially raised concerns for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, the peripheral"
