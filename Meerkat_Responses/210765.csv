   Assessment and Plan
   GI BLEED -- initial concern may be relatively small component (guiac
   positive brown stool, stable Hct).  [**Month (only) 11**] have chronic blood loss
   attributable to underlying ulcerative colitis.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed predominately to hypovolemia, now somewhat
   improved with fluid resussitation.  Empirical stress dose steroids
   added with concern for relative adrenal insufficiency.
   SEPSIS
 possible sources include C. diff, SBP, bacteremia.  Continue
   empirical antimicrobials.
   ENCEPHALOPATHY -- attributed to hepatic encephalopathy; improving with
   treatment of hypovolemia.  Continue lactulose.
   HYPOTHERMIA -- likely related to cirrhosis.  Possible sepsis -->
   cultures pending and empirical antimicrobials started.  Would desire
   sampling ascites fluid.  Check hypothyroidism.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency; attributed to
   hypovolemia (reduced PO intake, diarrhea, use of diuretics).  Monitor
   UO, BUN, creatinine.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- improving with hydration.  Continue to monitor.
   FLUIDS -- continue to resussitate.  Monitor I/O.
   COAGULOPATHY
 continue coumadin
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate PO as mental status improves.
   LUNG NODULE, right -- will require f/u in [**3-14**] months.
   LEFT THORACIC MASS -- ?diaphragmatic vs. lung parenchymal based.
   Concerns include diaphragmatic tumor, bronchogenic cyst, pericardial
   cyst, less likely sequestration.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented to the ICU with GI bleed and hypotension. They were initially unresponsive and had episodes of hypotension overnight, which improved with IV fluid boluses and higher dose steroids. The patient has a history of liver cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of chronic blood loss due to underlying ulcerative colitis, which may contribute to the current GI bleed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia, possibly exacerbated by renal failure and coagulopathy. This condition requires close monitoring and management.
3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis, with possible sources including Clostridium difficile (C. diff), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and bacteremia. Empirical antimicrobials have been started, and cultures are pending.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which is improving with treatment of hypovolemia. Lactulose should be continued.
5. Hypothermia: The patient likely has hypothermia, possibly related to cirrhosis. Sepsis could also be a contributing factor.
6. Renal failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency, likely due to hypovolem"

   Assessment and Plan
   GI BLEED -- initial concern may be relatively small component (guiac
   positive brown stool, stable Hct).  [**Month (only) 11**] have chronic blood loss
   attributable to underlying ulcerative colitis.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed predominately to hypovolemia, now somewhat
   improved with fluid resussitation.  Empirical stress dose steroids
   added with concern for relative adrenal insufficiency.
   SEPSIS
 possible sources include C. diff, SBP, bacteremia.  Continue
   empirical antimicrobials.
   ENCEPHALOPATHY -- attributed to hepatic encephalopathy; improving with
   treatment of hypovolemia.  Continue lactulose.
   HYPOTHERMIA -- likely related to cirrhosis.  Possible sepsis -->
   cultures pending and empirical antimicrobials started.  Would desire
   sampling ascites fluid.  Check hypothyroidism.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute on chronic insufficiency; attributed to
   hypovolemia (reduced PO intake, diarrhea, use of diuretics).  Monitor
   UO, BUN, creatinine.
   LACTIC ACIDOSIS -- improving with hydration.  Continue to monitor.
   FLUIDS -- continue to resussitate.  Monitor I/O.
   COAGULOPATHY
 continue coumadin
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate PO as mental status improves.
   LUNG NODULE, right -- will require f/u in [**3-14**] months.
   LEFT THORACIC MASS -- ?diaphragmatic vs. lung parenchymal based.
   Concerns include diaphragmatic tumor, bronchogenic cyst, pericardial
   cyst, less likely sequestration.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and hypotension. The patient's condition has been improving, with an improving mental status and some stabilization of vital signs. The patient has a history of chronic blood loss due to underlying ulcerative colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleeding: The patient initially presented with GI bleeding, which may be attributed to ulcerative colitis or other underlying conditions. There is a concern for ongoing bleeding, and close monitoring of stool guaiac and hemodynamic stability is necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia, potentially caused by GI bleeding, diarrhea, and use of diuretics. Fluid resuscitation has improved the patient's condition, but continued monitoring and management are required.

3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to possible infections such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and bacteremia. Empirical antimicrobials have been started, and cultures are pending. Ascites fluid sampling would be helpful in further evaluation.

4. Encephalopathy: The patient exhibits signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which is improving with treatment of hypovolemia. Lactulose should be continued to manage this condition.

5. Hypothermia: The patient is likely experiencing hypothermia"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), pacemaker (PPM), cirrhosis, and esophageal varices. He was admitted with fever, bloody diarrhea, vomiting, hypotension, and hypothermia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 102/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's physical examination revealed several abnormalities. His general appearance showed an ill-appearing male who was alert and responding to verbal commands. The head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT) examination showed mildly enlarged pupils with unequal reactions, sclera anicteric, moist mucous membranes, and clear oropharynx. The cardiovascular examination revealed regular heart rhythm with a pacemaker, third heart sound (S3), and normal systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The lung examination was clear bilaterally. The abdomen was soft, non-tender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds and dullness to percussion at the flanks. No Murphy's sign or rebound/guarding was noted. The extremities showed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Neurological examination showed altered mental status with orientation"

   Assessment and Plan
   70M h/o U.C.,  CAD s/p MI and CABG, CVA, CRI, AF on coumadin, recent dx
   of potential PBC  c/b esophageal varices p/w with decreased PO,
   vomiting, and bloody diarrhea admitted to ICU for hypotension and ?GI
   bleed.
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of hypothermia, may be potentially be Gram
   Negative Bacteremia. Could not tap on U/S. Started empiric treatment of
   SBP.  No evidence of GI Bleed, so less likely however will still
   provide the following:
   - Cont Cipro for 5
 10 days at SBP therapeutic dosing
   - Cont Vanc pending repeat BCx
   - Will discuss with GI the need for albumin
   - Follow-up BCx
   - 2 large bore PIVs
   - T&X, blood consent
   - Serial Hcts
   - NS fluid resuscitation but watch for CHF given EF 20-25%
   - Search for infectious source (?SBP, U/A, pulmonary, GI)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; check C. diff
   - Hold antihypertensives and diuretics
   - Cont Stress Dose steroids
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy off
   medications. Infectious causes also possible.
   - Cont Lactulose
   - f/u broad cultures
   - Cont cipro and vanco
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: GI following closely
   - Restart prednisone 40mg daily per liver recs
   - Hold mesalamine and hydrocort enemas for now, will discuss with GI
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to see in AM
   .
   # Cirrhosis:
   - f/u final Liver U/S
   - Lactulose 30ml q4h for goal stool output >1L
   - Hold nadalol given hypotension
   - If ascites, will perform diagnostic paracentesis
   - Continue Ursodiol for ?PSC
   - Liver considering biopsy, will need echo to eval for transplant
   - Contact Dr. [**Name (STitle) 1609**] per family request
   .
   # Respiratory Alkalosis: ? Secondary to Cirrhosis, vs Hyperventillation
   from infection or pain
   - No current interventions.
   .
   # CAD: s/p multiple prior MI and CABG revascularization.
   - Hold ASA for now given hypotension and ?GI bleeding
   - Hold beta-blockers and lisinopril given hypotension
   - Continue statin
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 20-25% per OSH records, s/p ICD
   for VT w/ dual-chamber pacemaker. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - Follow volume status closely while rehydrating for low BPs
   - Holding nadolol, lasix, enalapril, and aldactone for now
   - Continue digoxin; check dig level
   - Daily weights and I/Os strictly
   .
   # Afib: A-V paced.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold beta-blockers and coumadin for now
   .
   # CVA: Reported to have had stroke in past in setting of not being on
   coumadin, complicated by residual defecits. Holding coumadin for now
   but no acute reversal given high risk for stroke and would resume
   tomorrow if HD stable and no significant bleeding.
   .
   # DM2: Unknown recent A1c. Hold metformin while in-house, and follow
   FSBG qid w/ ISS coverage.
   .
   # FEN:  NPO except meds, replete lytes prn

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hypothermia, gastrointestinal bleed, and cirrhosis of the liver. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient has an allergy to iodine, penicillins, morphine, Flagyl (metronidazole), allopurinol, erythromycin, tetracycline, septran (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), and ramipril.
- The patient received vancomycin and ciprofloxacin within the last 24 hours.
- The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/56 mmHg to 116/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg.
- Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,510 mL, with outputs of 759 mL blood products, 434 mL urine, and 325 mL NG. The overall balance is 2,751 mL.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count of 19.3 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels, increased creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL, and altered liver function tests.
- The patient has been monitored for various parameters including hemodynamics, respiratory support, and fluid balance.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and altered liver function tests may indicate an ongoing infection. The patient's allergies to multiple antibiotics may limit treatment options.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 2,751 mL, indicating potential fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and cardiac dysfunction.
3. Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is a concern, and ongoing bleeding cannot be ruled out. The patient's coagulation profile should be closely monitored.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's history of cirrhosis and altered liver function tests suggest ongoing hepatic dysfunction. This can impact the patient's metabolism and clearance of drugs.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate persistent hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, fluid overload, or cardiac dysfunction.
6. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F"

   Assessment and Plan
   70M h/o ulcerative colitis, coronary disease s/p MI and CABG, CVA, CRI,
   Afib on coumadin, recent diagnosis cirrhosis c/b esophageal varices
   presents with 2 days decreased PO intake, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea
   admitted to ICU for hypotension and ?GI bleed.
   .
   # Hypotension: Per family baseline SBP 100-120. Differential includes
   hypovolemia due to poor PO intake and diarrhea, GI bleeding (risk
   factors of esophageal varices, UC erosions), sepsis. Less likely
   cardiogenic or neurogenic or medication induced or adrenal
   insufficiency (only on steroids for ~8 days). Most probable cause is
   hypovolemia which is multifactorial due to decreased POs, vomiting,
   diarrhea, diuretics; however given hypothermia consider infectious
   source (GI, pulmonary, urinary).
   - Hold ASA and coumadin for now but no acute reversal given stable Hct
   - Maintain 2 lg bore PIVs, consider CVL should more access be required
   - T&X, blood consent
   - Q6H Hct (maintain Hct>30 given significant underlying CAD)
   - NS fluid resuscitation but watch for CHF given EF 20-25%
   - Search for infectious source (?SBP, U/A, pulmonary, GI)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; check C. diff
   - Portable CXR to eval for infiltrate - prelim negative, f/u final read
   and recheck CXR in AM post-hydration
   - Continue cipro and add vanco; low threshold for broadening or adding
   additional [**Doctor Last Name 23**] (?aztreonam given PCN allergy, could consider gent
   although renal failure)
   - Hold antihypertensives and diuretics
   - Place A-line should continue to remain hypotensive
   - Restarting PO steroids for now but consider stress dose if not
   improving with IVFs
   .
   # ?GI bleed: Likely related to UC given recent flare and discontinuing
   medications in the past week. Also consider mesenteric ischemia in
   vasculopath especially given elevated lactate although no abdominal
   pain at present.
   - PPI IV bid
   - Trend lactate
   - IVF hydration to maintain BP
   - Serial Hct per above
   - Check amylase
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Treat UC per below
   - If HD significant bleeding, call GI for possible scope and consider
   tagged cell scan, angio, or embolization
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely due to hepatic encephalopathy off
   medications. Infectious causes also possible.
   - Lacutlose
   - f/u broad cultures
   - Consider para if ascites present
   - Continue cipro and vanco
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Recent flare noted on
   C-scope [**10-18**]. Patient had been non-compliant with medications for the
   past week coinciding with worsening of his symptoms.
   - Restart prednisone 40mg daily per liver recs
   - Hold mesalamine and hydrocort enemas for now, will discuss with GI
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to see in AM
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Stage IV based on varices, ascites, splenomegaly. Followed
   by Dr. [**Name (STitle) 1609**]. Etiology of cirrhosis was unclear. Possibility with
   PSC with UC was entertained and an outpatient ERCP was recommened by
   liver within 2 weeks of discharge.
   - Lactulose 30ml q4h for goal stool output >1L
   - Hold nadalol given hypotension
   - Ciprofloxacin for empiric SBP (has PCN allergy)
   - Abdominal U/S to assess biliary tree, ?ascites and marking
   - If ascites, will perform diagnostic paracentesis
   - Continue Ursodiol for ?PSC; consider inpatient MRCP/ERCP
   - Liver following
   - Will send anti-LKM and -SLA per liver to eval for autoimmune cause
   - Liver considering biopsy, will need echo to eval for transplant
   - Contact Dr. [**Name (STitle) 1609**] per family request
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cre 1.8-2.0, currently 3.9.
   Likely prerenal [**3-13**] poor PO intake and diarrhea. ATN also possible from
   hypoperfusion given hypotension.
   - Maintain renal perfusion with IVF resuscitation
   - Check urine lytes
   - Renal ultrasound
   - Hold ACEi and diuretics for now
   - Trend Cre daily
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Should not improve with fluids will consider renal consult
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Due to acute renal failure. No ECG signs although A-V
   paced. Recheck K+.
   .
   # AG acidosis: Likely related to elevated lactate from poor tissue
   perfusion / hypotension related to above. Renal failure may also be
   contributing. Treat per above and monitor lactate serially.
   .
   # CAD: s/p multiple prior MI and CABG revascularization.
   - Hold ASA for now given hypotension and ?GI bleeding
   - Hold beta-blockers and lisinopril given hypotension
   - Continue statin
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 20-25% per OSH records, s/p ICD
   for VT w/ dual-chamber pacemaker. Appears euvolemic currently.
   - Follow volume status closely while rehydrating for low BPs
   - Holding nadolol, lasix, enalapril, and aldactone for now
   - Continue digoxin; check dig level
   - Daily weights and I/Os strictly
   .
   # Afib: A-V paced.
   - Continue digoxin and amiodarone
   - Hold beta-blockers and coumadin for now
   .
   # CVA: Reported to have had stroke in past in setting of not being on
   coumadin, complicated by residual defecits. Holding coumadin for now
   but no acute reversal given high risk for stroke and would resume
   tomorrow if HD stable and no significant bleeding.
   .
   # DM2: Unknown recent A1c. Hold metformin while in-house, and follow
   FSBG qid w/ ISS coverage.
   .
   # FEN:  NPO except meds, replete lytes prn
   # Access:  PIV x2 (18g)
   # PPx:  Therapeutic on coumadin, PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular accident, chronic renal insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, chronic systolic heart failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He presented to the ICU with hypotension and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently unstable, requiring close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's baseline systolic blood pressure is 100-120 mmHg, but he is currently experiencing hypotension. This could be due to hypovolemia from poor oral intake and diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding (esophageal varices or UC erosions), sepsis, or medication-induced hypotension. The most probable cause seems to be hypovolemia with multifactorial etiology.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and recent flare-up, which increases the risk of GI bleeding. Additionally, the presence of esophageal varices due to cirrhosis can also lead to bleeding.

3. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. This needs to be evaluated further, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creat"
