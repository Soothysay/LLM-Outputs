   HISTORY: Hypoxia. Tachypnea.
   A single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates persistent
   left-sided
   pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis, unchanged from [**2111-5-10**].
   Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Trachea is midline. No
   pneumothorax. Equivocal right-sided pleural effusion is unchanged.
   IMPRESSION:
   No interval change
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 48 y.o.f. with mitral valve prolapse and mitral
   regurgitation who presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and
   shortness of breath, found to be in CHF.
   # Tachypnea and hypoxia
 Differential diagnosis includes CHF,
   pneumonia, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], pericardial effusion, profound anemia, pulmonary
   fibrosis, cardiopulmonary shunt.  No evidence for pericardial effusion
   or PE on CTA.  No profound anemia.  Has appearance of CHF on CXR from
   last night, diuresed to IV lasix however is persistently tachypneic,
   tachycardic and hypoxic.  Unclear etiology.  Clinical picture doesn
   entirely fit with CHF, BNP not excessively elevated, no elevated JVP,
   she does have crackles on exam, but her hypoxia is unexpectedly severe
   for her radiographic and clinical appearance of pulmonary edema. LDH is
   markedly elevated, raising suspicion for either liver disease,
   malignancy or PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 2320**] CXR now after diuresis
   - ECHO to assess valvular function and EF/diastolic dysfunction, and to
   eval for shunt physiology tomorrow (no echo techs on holiday)
   - Lasix for diuresis again this am
   - Hold BB in setting of acute decompensation
   - Pt consented for HIV testing, draw today
   - check b-glucan, induced sputum for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] ACE [**Name Initial (PRE) **] as able for afterload reduction
   - Continue levofloxacin for possible CAP
   -Consider repeat CTA today after diuresis to better approach
   parenchymal disease.
   # Hyponatremia
 Resolved. Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **] while diuresing
   # Hearing and vision changes
 Likely side effect of azithromycin.
   Evaluated by neurology on admission who at that time found her symptoms
   to have resolved and recommended switching antibiotics and a brain MRI
   should symptoms recur
   -otoscopic exam today
   -Call neuro to query what we are looking for on brain MRI, consider MRI
   today/tomorrow to eval.
   #Thrombotytopenia.  Nl platelets 2 years ago, 115 on admission, 88
   now.  No stigmata of liver disease on exam.  LDH markedly elevated.
   Ddx for thrombocytopenia most likely is liver disease versus medication
   effect.
   -Check LFTs
   # Anxiety
 caution with sedation, but will use small doses of prn
   morphine and anxiert for sympomatic control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation. She presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and shortness of breath, and was found to be in congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has been persistently tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic despite diuresis with lasix. Her ABG showed worsening hypoxia. She has also experienced hearing loss and vision changes, which are likely side effects of azithromycin. The patient has been evaluated by neurology and an otoscopic exam has been performed. She also has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 88, and markedly elevated LDH. The differential diagnosis includes CHF, pneumonia, PCP, pericardial effusion, profound anemia, pulmonary fibrosis, and cardiopulmonary shunt. An ECHO has been ordered to assess valvular function and evaluate for shunt physiology. Lasix will be continued for diuresis, and the patient's HIV status will be checked. Repeat CTA may be considered to better approach parenchymal disease. Levofloxacin will be continued for possible CAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 48 y.o.f. with mitral valve prolapse and mitral
   regurgitation who presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and
   shortness of breath, found to be in CHF.
   # Shortness of breath
 CXR, BNP, and exam consistent with CHF
   exacerbation.  Unclear why patient with worsening CHF as ECHO in [**2108**]
   with nml EF and no evidence of diastolic dysfunction.  However, ? if
   worsening mitral regurgitation or worsening diastolic or systolic heart
   dysfunction that was worsened in setting of PNA.
   - ECHO to assess valvular function and EF/diastolic dysfunction
   - Lasix for diuresis
   - Hold BB in setting of acute decompensation
   - ACE I as able for afterload reduction
   - Attempt to control HR to help with filling time (treat infection and
   anxiety)
   - Nitro paste prn
   - Hydralazine prn for BP if needed
   - NC as needed to maintain O2 >93%
   - Morphine prn
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat EKG
   - Continue levofloxacin for possible CAP
   # Hyponatremia
 Na improved to 132 from 131 on admission.  Etiology
   initially felt to be due to hypovolemia in setting of nausea, diarrhea,
   high SG, and ketones in urine.  Has diuresed with lasix and Na stable.
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hearing and vision changes
 Likely side effect of azithromycin.
   Evaluated by neurology without any concerning pathology.  Continue to
   monitor.
   # Anxiety
 Based on exam and prior notes, significant component of
   increased RR is anxiety as when patient sleeping RR in mid 20s.
   However, seemed to become more somnolent this a.m. when ativan given,
   so will need to be careful.
   - Monitor closely and give ativan prn as needed
   - Speak with PCP about level of anxiety patient experiences and if
   chronic medication is indicated

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 48 y.o.f. with mitral valve prolapse and mitral
   regurgitation who presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and
   shortness of breath, found to be in CHF.
   # Shortness of breath
 CXR, BNP, and exam consistent with CHF
   exacerbation.  Unclear why patient with worsening CHF as ECHO in [**2108**]
   with nml EF and no evidence of diastolic dysfunction.  However, ? if
   worsening mitral regurgitation or worsening diastolic or systolic heart
   dysfunction that was worsened in setting of PNA.
   - ECHO to assess valvular function and EF/diastolic dysfunction
   - Lasix for diuresis
   - Hold BB in setting of acute decompensation
   - ACE I as able for afterload reduction
   - Attempt to control HR to help with filling time (treat infection and
   anxiety)
   - Nitro paste prn
   - Hydralazine prn for BP if needed
   - NC as needed to maintain O2 >93%
   - Morphine prn
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat EKG
   - Continue levofloxacin for possible CAP
   # Hyponatremia
 Na improved to 132 from 131 on admission.  Etiology
   initially felt to be due to hypovolemia in setting of nausea, diarrhea,
   high SG, and ketones in urine.  Has diuresed with lasix and Na stable.
   - Follow lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hearing and vision changes
 Likely side effect of azithromycin.
   Evaluated by neurology without any concerning pathology.  Continue to
   monitor.
   # Anxiety
 Based on exam and prior notes, significant component of
   increased RR is anxiety as when patient sleeping RR in mid 20s.
   However, seemed to become more somnolent this a.m. when ativan given,
   so will need to be careful.
   - Monitor closely and give ativan prn as needed
   - Speak with PCP about level of anxiety patient experiences and if
   chronic medication is indicated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation. She presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and shortness of breath, and was found to be in congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. Her condition has been worsening despite previous treatment. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/72 to 124/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. She is receiving multiple medications including lorazepam, furosemide, and morphine sulfate. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, troponin-T, and glucose. However, her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, and her potassium and magnesium levels are low. An echocardiogram has been ordered to assess valvular function and ejection fraction/diastolic dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation: The patient's symptoms and vital signs suggest ongoing CHF. If left untreated, this could lead to further fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and potential cardiac arrest.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 48-year-old female with MVP/MR who presented to the emergency department a few days ago with pneumonia (PNA). She was initially treated with IV diuretics and antibiotics, but her condition worsened, leading to her transfer to the ICU for worsening hypoxia. The patient remains tachypneic with fluctuating FiO2 requirements and is currently on 3 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. She received approximately 1.5 liters of IV Lasix with no significant improvement in oxygenation.

The patient has allergies to Zithromax (oral) due to ototoxicity and vision changes. She received infusions of lorazepam, furosemide, and morphine sulfate. Other medications include Levaquin for possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 103/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 3 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. She is in sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 440 mL and output of 1575 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1135 mL. She is receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and her ABG results show pH 7.47, PaCO2 40, PaO2 73, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 73.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress, with no abnormalities in the eyes, head, ears, nose, or throat. She has normal cardiovascular findings except for tachycardia. Her respiratory system is clear with no crackles or wheezes. The abdomen is soft and bowel sounds are present. There are no extremity or skin abnormalities. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin of 15.3 g/dL, leukocyte count of 88 K/uL, platelet count of 117 mg/dL, sodium of 0.9 mg/dL, potassium of 27 mEq/L, chloride of 3.5 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 23 mg/dL, BUN of 92 mEq/L, creatinine of 135 mg/dL, glucose of 117 mg/dL, and troponin T of <0.01. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute respiratory distress, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The clinical picture is not characteristic of CHF decompensation alone. The plan is to repeat CXR and likely high-resolution chest CT, perform an echo/bubble study, check HIV status, and induce sputum for PCP. Supplemental oxygen will"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of MVP/MR who presented to the ED with acute respiratory distress. She was initially treated for pneumonia (PNA) and later transferred to the ICU due to worsening hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia and tachypnea, with escalating FiO2 requirements. She is currently on high-flow oxygen. The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, normal pupils, and clear breath sounds with diminished breath sounds at the bases. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia and tachypnea, with a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's blood work reveals leukocytosis, elevated troponin T levels, and elevated LDH levels. The assessment and plan include further imaging studies, such as a repeat CXR and high-resolution chest CT, as well as an echo/bubble study to evaluate for pulmonary embolism. The patient's hearing loss has been previously attributed to azithromycin use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with symptoms consistent with pneumonia, which may have contributed to her acute respiratory distress.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of hypoxia, tachycardia, tachypnea, and elevated troponin T levels suggest the possibility of ARDS.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of MVP/MR who presented to the ED with acute respiratory distress. She was initially treated for possible pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF) but did not show improvement. The patient was transferred to the ICU where she remains critically ill, experiencing fluctuating oxygen requirements and persistent tachypnea. The cause of her hypoxia is still unclear, and further investigations are planned, including repeat imaging, echocardiogram, and testing for HIV and PCP. The patient also has a history of hearing loss previously attributed to azithromycin and evidence of transaminitis with preserved synthetic function. Autoimmune labs have been ordered due to multiple unexplained organ system abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent tachypnea and fluctuating oxygen requirements indicate ongoing respiratory distress, which may lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Cardiac Dysfunction: Given the patient's history of MVP/MR, there is a possibility of underlying cardiac dysfunction contributing to her symptoms. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram can help determine the extent of cardiac involvement.
3. Infection: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing symptoms suggest a possible infection, such as pneumonia or another infectious process. Continued surveillance and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The evidence of transaminitis raises concern for hepatic dysfunction. Monitoring liver function tests and evaluating for"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Mildly increased liver echogenicity is consistent with fatty liver;
   however, other liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
   cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded. No focal liver lesion was
   detected.
   2. The portal vein, IVC and hepatic veins demonstrate normal flow
   patterns.
   3. The spleen is in the upper limits of normal measuring approximately
   12 cm.
   4. No ascites was noted.
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 48 y.o.f. with mitral valve prolapse and mitral
   regurgitation who presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and
   shortness of breath, with evidence for PNA, persistent hypoxia and LFT
   abnormalities.
   # Tachypnea and hypoxia
 Differential diagnosis includes CHF,
   pneumonia, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], pericardial effusion, profound anemia, pulmonary
   fibrosis, cardiopulmonary shunt.  No evidence for pericardial effusion
   or PE on CTA.  No profound anemia.  Has appearance of CHF on CXR,
   however has not improved with diuresis.  Unclear etiology.  Clinical
   picture doesn

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation. She presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and shortness of breath. The patient has evidence of pneumonia (PNA), persistent hypoxia, and liver function test (LFT) abnormalities.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Tachypnea and hypoxia: The patient is experiencing rapid and shallow breathing with crackles bilaterally at the bases. This suggests the possibility of pulmonary edema, which could be due to congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis, cardiopulmonary shunt, or other causes. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

2. LFT abnormalities: The patient has transaminitis with AST and ALT levels in the thousands, and an AST/ALT ratio of approximately 2:1. This degree of transaminitis can be caused by various factors including alcohol hepatitis, medications (such as Tylenol), shock liver, viral hepatitis, or autoimmune hepatitis. Additional testing is required to identify the underlying cause of these abnormalities.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 115 on admission to 88 now. The cause of thrombocytopenia could be liver disease or medication effect. Further evaluation of liver function and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation. She presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and shortness of breath. The patient has evidence of pneumonia, persistent hypoxia, and liver function test abnormalities. Her vital signs show tachycardia, tachypnea, and low blood pressure. The physical examination reveals anxiousness, crackles in the lungs, and a palpable spleen tip. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, elevated LDH, and thrombocytopenia. Imaging studies show worsening left-sided pneumonia, bilateral effusions, and a 3mm left kidney stone. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving oxygen and various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has worsening left-sided pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory distress and potential sepsis if not treated appropriately.
2. Liver Disease: The patient's significantly elevated liver enzymes and high LDH levels suggest possible liver disease, which may require further investigation and management.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count could indicate a bleeding risk, especially with abnormal coagulation parameters.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor perfusion and could be due to sepsis, heart failure, or other underlying conditions.
5. Hyponatremia: Although resolved, the patient's initial hy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires oxygen supplementation. The patient has been diagnosed with severe liver dysfunction, as indicated by elevated AST, ALT, LDH levels, and low platelet count. There are also signs of fluid overload, with worsening bilateral pleural effusions and improvement in fluid overload. The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening left-sided pneumonia and right-sided atelectasis. There is no evidence of PCP pneumonia. The patient has a history of allergies to Azithromycin and has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including Vancomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe liver dysfunction: The elevated AST, ALT, and LDH levels, along with the low platelet count, indicate severe liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and impaired metabolism of medications.
2. Fluid overload: The presence of fluid overload suggests that the patient may be at risk of developing acute kidney injury or pulmonary edema if not managed appropriately.
3. Infection: The worsening left-sided pneumonia and right-sided atelectasis seen on the CT chest indicate an ongoing infection. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
4. Allergies: The patient's documented allergy to Azithromycin should be taken into consideration when selecting future antibiotic treatments to avoid any adverse reactions.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo woman with MVR/MVP adm with dyspnea, now with persistant
   hypoxemia, hearing loss, LFT abnormalities, mild fevers, tachypnea,
   tachycardia, mediastinal and hilar LAD. No joint inflammation or
   rashes.  HCV and HBV negative. Initially presented with headache,
   nausea, anorexia, and leukopenic with mild fever. No h/o exposure to
   pets, animals, travel. From [**State 2340**] originally. Armenian
   descent.
   I do not know what is the unifying diagnosis here. She never had a very
   high fever, apparently the USG did not suggest splenomegaly but upper
   limits of normal size. A viral illness may explain some of this,
   possibly HAV or EBV but still doesn
t explain the high oxygen requiring
   resp failure except that she got volume resuscitation when she
   presented dehydrated and has known MR/MVP.
   Hypoxmia, corrects with 5L NC oxygen.
   Most likely V/Q abnormality, as she does correct with supplemental
   oxygen. [**Month (only) 60**] have mild shunt, though unlikely the primary cause
   considering correction.
   Echo with bubble study pending.
   Pneumonia- not radiographically severe
   CHF
   Pulm htn- not indicated by CT
   ID. Recent pna.
   Sputum not obtained. Beta glucan pending.
   Levoflox- changed from azithro for CAP- changed for vision/hearing
   changes.
   Requesting Legionella urine Ag.
   Bronch probably not worthwhile if HIV negative. HIV pending. EBV
   pending.
   LFT abnormalities
   AST:ALT 2:1 though no sig EtOH hx.
   No rashes, joint inflammation, persistant fevers.
   H/O mild loose stools.
   HAV now positive antibody, but IgG. Will request IgM.
   GI consult for liver service input, value of biopsy.
   Hearing loss- occurred days after first dose of azithromycin. Neuro
   input appreciated.
   Thrombocytopenia.
   Likely synthetic dysfunction.
   Stopped subcut heparin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old woman with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) who was admitted with blurred vision, hearing loss, and hypoxemia. She was initially treated for presumed pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF) and received azithromycin. However, she developed new left ventricular failure, tachypnea, tachycardia, pulmonary edema, and liver function abnormalities, including elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy. She also had thrombocytopenia and anemia. Imaging studies showed improved pulmonary congestion but increased pleural effusions, left infiltrate, and hilar adenopathy. The patient's respiratory support included supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, and she required frequent evaluation for possible mechanical ventilation support. She had mild fevers and showed no signs of rash or joint inflammation. Blood cultures were negative for Hepatitis C and B. The patient's condition remained critical, and she required close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent hypoxemia and tachypnea indicate respiratory failure. She required supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical ventilation support.
2. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's liver function abnormalities, including elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy, suggest hepatic dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count indicates thrombocytopenia. This"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old woman with mitral valve prolapse and mitral valve regurgitation who was admitted with blurred vision, hearing loss, and hypoxemia. She was treated for presumed pneumonia and congestive heart failure. She was given azithromycin, which may have caused some of the vision and hearing abnormalities. She was then transferred to the medical ICU for hypoxemia, tachypnea, tachycardia, pulmonary edema, new liver function abnormalities, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Her AST and ALT levels were significantly elevated, along with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Her albumin level was 3.3 g/dL.

24-hour events include diuresis with no change in chest X-ray, a computed tomography angiography (CTA) that was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), and a CT scan showing improved pulmonary vascular congestion but increased pleural effusions, left infiltrate, and increased hilar adenopathy. An ultrasound (USG) showed all hepatic veins to be patent with no ascites, and a high-normal spleen size. Beta glucan is pending, and induced sputum was not obtainable.

The patient has allergies to Zithromax (azithromycin), ototoxicity, and vision abnormalities. She received morphine sulfate infusion at 09:15 PM on [**2111-"

   HIV negative
   Imaging: TTE [**5-12**]:
   The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
   ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
   There is passage of a few late bubbles, which may consistent with
   pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
   motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
   normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
   likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation.The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is moderate anterior > posterior mitral valve
   prolapse. The severity of regurgitation is difficult to assess due to
   tachycardia but appears moderate (2+) in severity. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Resting tachycardia. No ASD by 2D/color Doppler evaluation,
   but visualization of a few late bubbles (after 10 beats) which may be
   consistent with pulmonary AVMs. Borderline normal left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate mitral valve prolapse. Moderate mitral
   regurgitation (difficult to assess severity due to marked tachycardia).
   Compared to the prior study of [**2108-12-28**], the heart rate is significantly
   faster. Overall left ventricular function appear less vigorous.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 48 y.o.f. with mitral valve prolapse and mitral
   regurgitation who presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and
   shortness of breath, transferred to ICU for hypoxia.  Currently with as
   of yet unexplained hypoxia with tachycardia and tachypnea, abnormal
   LFTs, thrombocytopenia, hearing loss, altered mental status,
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy, low grade fever, and now an abnormal brain
   MRI.
   #Abnormal MRI: In setting of confusing  constellation of symptoms which
   we would like to tie together into unifying diagnosis, the presence of
   CNS involvement, specifically the leptomeninges raises concern for
   possible infectious etiologies: less likely typical bacterial
   meningitis due to duration of symptoms, consider viral etiologies (HSV,
   CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6), TB, Syphilis, ehrilichia, leptospira, lyme;
   lymphoma, inflammatory conditions: neurosarcoidosis, SLE.
   -appreciate neuro assistance, recommend LP
   -will consult ID with assistance with any necessary empiric abx and
   with suggestions for work up of infectious etiology of symptoms.
   -f/u RPR
   # Tachypnea and hypoxia
Current differential diagnosis includes CHF,
   pneumonia, unlikely PCP given HIV negative status, unlikely  PE or
   pericardial effusion given negative CTA.  Slight delayed bubbles on TTE
   raise possiblity of pulmonary AVMs.    No profound anemia.  Has
   appearance of CHF on CXR, however has not improved with diuresis, BNP
   not significantly elevated and hypoxia seems out of proportion to other
   findings, no elevated JVP.    Unclear etiology. CT did not show
   impressive septation suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  Consider
   inflammatory process, sarcoid, SLE especially in setting of
   mediastinal LAD.  LAD also suspicious for neoplasm, although unclear
   how this would explain hypoxia based on CT.

   - Continue levofloxacin for possible CAP
   - PPD planted yesterday, will need to be read tomorrow.
   #LFT abnormalities:  Pt has transaminitis >1000s, AST/ALT ratio ~2:1.
   Ddx for this degree of transaminitis includes ETOH hepatitis,
   medications (ie tylenol), shock liver, viral hepatitis.  Less likely

   - Hepatology input appreciated, covering with doxycycline empirically
   for leptospira.
   - TTG nl, sprue unlikely

   Ddx for thrombocytopenia most likely is liver disease versus medication
   effect.  Combination of elevated LDH and ferritin in setting of
   enlarged spleen and neurologic abnormalities is suggestive of HLH
   however does not meet criteria.
   -check peripheral smear
   -fibrinogen low but FDP nl, not picture of DIC

   Disposition:ICU for now while so tachypneic/tachycardic/hypoxic
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation who presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and shortness of breath. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and is currently experiencing tachycardia, tachypnea, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, hearing loss, altered mental status, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, low-grade fever, and an abnormal brain MRI.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Infectious etiologies: The presence of CNS involvement, specifically leptomeninges, raises concern for possible infectious etiologies such as viral meningitis (HSV, CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6), tuberculosis, syphilis, ehrlichiosis, leptospira, or Lyme disease.

2. Lymphoma or inflammatory conditions: The combination of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and neurologic abnormalities suggests the possibility of lymphoma or inflammatory conditions such as neurosarcoidosis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

3. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs): The delayed bubbles seen on the echocardiogram raise the possibility of PAVMs, which could explain the hypoxia.

4. Heart failure: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath"

   HIV negative
   Imaging: TTE [**5-12**]:
   The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
   ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
   There is passage of a few late bubbles, which may consistent with
   pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
   motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
   normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
   likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation.The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is moderate anterior > posterior mitral valve
   prolapse. The severity of regurgitation is difficult to assess due to
   tachycardia but appears moderate (2+) in severity. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Resting tachycardia. No ASD by 2D/color Doppler evaluation,
   but visualization of a few late bubbles (after 10 beats) which may be
   consistent with pulmonary AVMs. Borderline normal left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate mitral valve prolapse. Moderate mitral
   regurgitation (difficult to assess severity due to marked tachycardia).
   Compared to the prior study of [**2108-12-28**], the heart rate is significantly
   faster. Overall left ventricular function appear less vigorous.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 48 y.o.f. with mitral valve prolapse and mitral
   regurgitation who presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and
   shortness of breath, transferred to ICU for hypoxia.  Currently with as
   of yet unexplained hypoxia with tachycardia and tachypnea, abnormal
   LFTs, thrombocytopenia, hearing loss, altered mental status,
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy, low grade fever, and now an abnormal brain
   MRI.
   #Abnormal MRI: In setting of confusing  constellation of symptoms which
   we would like to tie together into unifying diagnosis, the presence of
   CNS involvement, specifically the leptomeninges raises concern for
   possible infectious etiologies: less likely typical bacterial
   meningitis due to duration of symptoms, consider viral etiologies (HSV,
   CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6), TB, Syphilis, ehrilichia, leptospira, lyme;
   lymphoma, inflammatory conditions: neurosarcoidosis, SLE.
   -appreciate neuro assistance, recommend LP
   -will consult ID with assistance with any necessary empiric abx and
   with suggestions for work up of infectious etiology of symptoms.
   -f/u RPR
   # Tachypnea and hypoxia
Current differential diagnosis includes CHF,
   pneumonia, unlikely PCP given HIV negative status, unlikely  PE or
   pericardial effusion given negative CTA.  Slight delayed bubbles on TTE
   raise possiblity of pulmonary AVMs.    No profound anemia.  Has
   appearance of CHF on CXR, however has not improved with diuresis, BNP
   not significantly elevated and hypoxia seems out of proportion to other
   findings, no elevated JVP.    Unclear etiology. CT did not show
   impressive septation suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  Consider
   inflammatory process, sarcoid, SLE especially in setting of
   mediastinal LAD.  LAD also suspicious for neoplasm, although unclear
   how this would explain hypoxia based on CT.

   EF and hypotension with ACEI, d/c

   - Continue levofloxacin for possible CAP
   - PPD planted yesterday, will need to be read tomorrow.
   #LFT abnormalities:  Pt has transaminitis >1000s, AST/ALT ratio ~2:1.
   Ddx for this degree of transaminitis includes ETOH hepatitis,
   medications (ie tylenol), shock liver, viral hepatitis.  Less likely

   negative for HBV, HCV and acute HAV.  Given the rapid downward trend in
   pt

   - Hepatology input appreciated, covering with doxycycline empirically
   for leptospira.

   #Thrombotytopenia.  Nl platelets 2 years ago, 115 on admission, 88
   now.  No stigmata of liver disease on exam.  LDH markedly elevated.
   Ddx for thrombocytopenia most likely is liver disease versus medication
   effect.  Combination of elevated LDH and ferritin in setting of
   enlarged spleen and neurologic abnormalities is suggestive of HLH

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation. She presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, shortness of breath, and evidence of pneumonia. The patient has persistent hypoxia, abnormal liver function tests, and thrombocytopenia. Her symptoms also include nausea, dry heaves, and an altered mental status. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and tachypnea. Imaging tests reveal a few late bubbles on echocardiogram, suggesting possible pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. The patient's brain MRI shows leptomeningeal enhancement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious etiologies: The presence of CNS involvement, specifically leptomeninges, raises concern for possible infectious causes such as viral (HSV, CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6) meningitis or encephalitis. Other potential infectious causes include tuberculosis, syphilis, ehrlichiosis, leptospirosis, and Lyme disease.
2. Lymphoma or inflammatory conditions: The altered mental status, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and abnormal brain MRI raise the possibility of lymphoma or inflammatory conditions like neurosarcoidosis or systemic lupus erythematosus.
3. Hepatitis: The patient's LFT abnormalities with an AST/ALT ratio of 2:1 may indicate acute hepatitis"

   HIV negative
   Imaging: TTE [**5-12**]:
   The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
   ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
   There is passage of a few late bubbles, which may consistent with
   pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
   motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
   normal (LVEF 50-55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
   likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation.The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is moderate anterior > posterior mitral valve
   prolapse. The severity of regurgitation is difficult to assess due to
   tachycardia but appears moderate (2+) in severity. The estimated
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Resting tachycardia. No ASD by 2D/color Doppler evaluation,
   but visualization of a few late bubbles (after 10 beats) which may be
   consistent with pulmonary AVMs. Borderline normal left ventricular
   systolic function. Moderate mitral valve prolapse. Moderate mitral
   regurgitation (difficult to assess severity due to marked tachycardia).
   Compared to the prior study of [**2108-12-28**], the heart rate is significantly
   faster. Overall left ventricular function appear less vigorous.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 48 y.o.f. with mitral valve prolapse and mitral
   regurgitation who presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and
   shortness of breath, with evidence for PNA, persistent hypoxia and LFT
   abnormalities.
   # Tachypnea and hypoxia
 Differential diagnosis includes CHF,
   pneumonia, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], pericardial effusion, profound anemia, pulmonary
   fibrosis, cardiopulmonary shunt.  No evidence for pericardial effusion
   or PE on CTA.  No profound anemia.  Has appearance of CHF on CXR,
   however has not improved with diuresis.  Unclear etiology.  Clinical
   picture doesn
t entirely fit with CHF, BNP not excessively elevated, no
   elevated JVP, she does have crackles on exam, but her hypoxia is
   unexpectedly severe for her radiographic and clinical appearance of
   pulmonary edema. LDH is markedly elevated, raising suspicion for either
   liver disease, malignancy or PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] chest CT (final read pending)
   showed no evidence PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2324**] in pleural effusions,  worsening left
   sided PNA and atelectasis, improvement in pulmonary edema, persistent
   mediastinal LAD.  Correction of hypoxia with 02 makes shunt less
   likely, wet read ECHO with bubble study without evidence for
   shunting.   ? HLH in setting of neurologic symptoms, high LDH and
   ferritin.  Would need bronch to evaluate path.
   - f/u final read TTE
   - HIV ab test sent yesterday, f/u
   - b-glucan sent, f/u, pt unable to produce sputum upon induction, if
   hypoxia persists, consider bronch.
   - discontinue ACEI if EF normal as pt becomes hypotensive after it is
   given.
   - Continue levofloxacin for possible CAP
   - plant PPD
   - RPR
   #LFT abnormalities:  Pt has transaminitis >1000s, AST/ALT ratio ~2:1.

   Disposition:ICU for now while so tachypneic/tachycardic
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
- Tachypnea (rapid shallow breathing) with crackles bilaterally at bases may indicate pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
- Hypoxia (low oxygen levels) is unexpectedly severe for the clinical appearance of pulmonary edema, raising suspicion for liver disease, malignancy, or Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).
- Atelectasis (partial collapse of the lung) is present, which could contribute to respiratory distress.

2. Cardiac Complications:
- Moderate mitral valve prolapse with moderate mitral regurgitation suggests a structural heart problem.
- Left ventricular systolic function is low normal, indicating decreased pumping ability of the heart.
- Elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels may suggest heart failure.

3. Hepatic Complications:
- Markedly elevated liver enzymes (transaminitis >1000s) with an AST/ALT ratio ~2:1, suggesting an acute hepatitis-like process.
- Autoimmune hepatitis or drug-induced liver injury should be considered.
- Further evaluation with viral serologies, autoimmune markers, and genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is needed.

4. Neurological Complications:
- Hearing loss may be due to azithromycin adverse effect, but further evaluation with brain MRI with gadolinium is recommended.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions, including mitral valve prolapse (MVP), who presented with dyspnea, persistent hypoxemia, hearing loss, liver function abnormalities, mild fevers, tachypnea, and tachycardia. She also has mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. The patient initially had symptoms such as headache, nausea, anorexia, and leukopenia with mild fever.

From the review of systems, the patient experienced fatigue, nausea, emesis, hunger, improved hearing, and no pain. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, mild fever, tachypnea, and low blood pressure. She requires a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.

The physical examination reveals somnolence, anxiety, diaphoresis, no scleral icterus, supple neck, regular heart rhythm without murmurs, poor to moderate air movement with dullness at bilateral lung bases, and warm skin with no significant peripheral edema.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia, mild hyponatremia, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia. Other lab values show normal or slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Blood glucose and troponin-T levels are within normal limits, while creatinine is slightly elevated.

   48 yo woman with MVR/MVP adm with dyspnea, now with persistant
   hypoxemia, hearing loss, LFT abnormalities, mild fevers, tachypnea,
   tachycardia, mediastinal and hilar LAD. No joint inflammation or
   rashes.  HCV and HBV negative. Initially presented with headache,
   nausea, anorexia, and leukopenic with mild fever. Mild hyponatremia. No
   relevant exposures in her history. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]+ , titer pending.No rashes,
   joint inflammation. Hearing loss improving acc to pt. CTPA neg for PE.
   Pleural effusions very small- too small to tap.
   Difficult to describe unifying diagnosis that explains all of her
   systems involved:
          brain abnormalities- leptomeningeal process
          hypoxemia, severe though not as visibly dyspneic as
   yesterday
          chest LAD and interstitial opacification which appeared to
   be pulmonary edema
          LFT abnormalities rapidly improving and acute, making more
   likely toxic exposure or acute infection. Less likely infiltrative
   disease such as sarcoid or lupus given this chronicity.
          thrombocytopenia
          ARF with Cr 1.1 increased from baseline 0.7-0.9
          Confusing volume status: thought she was in pulm edema, got
   diuresed with no improvement in oxygenation. Initial BNP 500.
   Interstitial opacities may be interstitial infiltrate and not edema.
   Urine output approx 70-140cc/h, tachycardic.
          Mild hyponatremia - possibly with SIADH- will free water
   restrict.
   Start with LP.
   Broad micro w/u pending.
   Adding lyme serology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old woman who presented with dyspnea, persistent hypoxemia, hearing loss, liver function test abnormalities, mild fevers, tachypnea, tachycardia, and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. She has a history of mitral valve prolapse and mitral valve regurgitation. The patient initially had symptoms such as headache, nausea, anorexia, and leukopenia with mild fever. She tested negative for HIV, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus. The patient's condition has been rapidly deteriorating, with recent findings including periventricular enhancement on brain MRI, leptomeningeal process, and broad differential diagnosis. She continues to have persistent sinus tachycardia and requires high FiO2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has symptoms of dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia, which can be indicative of a PE. However, a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was negative for PE.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's persistent hypoxemia and interstitial opacities on chest imaging may suggest ARDS. The need for high FiO2 and worsening oxygenation further supports this possibility.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukopenia, and rapid deterioration could be signs of sepsis. Broad microbiology work"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 48 y.o.f. with mitral valve prolapse and mitral
   regurgitation who presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and
   shortness of breath, transferred to ICU for hypoxia.  Currently with as
   of yet unexplained hypoxia with tachycardia and tachypnea, abnormal
   LFTs, thrombocytopenia, hearing loss, altered mental status,
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy, low grade fever, and now an abnormal brain
   MRI.
   #Abnormal MRI: In setting of confusing  constellation of symptoms which
   we would like to tie together into unifying diagnosis, the presence of
   CNS involvement, specifically the leptomeninges raises concern for
   possible infectious etiologies: less likely typical bacterial
   meningitis due to duration of symptoms, consider viral etiologies (HSV,
   CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6), TB, Syphilis, ehrilichia, leptospira, lyme;
   lymphoma, inflammatory conditions: neurosarcoidosis, SLE.
   -appreciate neuro assistance, recommend LP
   -will consult ID with assistance with any necessary empiric abx and
   with suggestions for work up of infectious etiology of symptoms.
   -f/u RPR
   # Tachypnea and hypoxia
Current differential diagnosis includes CHF,
   pneumonia, unlikely PCP given HIV negative status, unlikely  PE or
   pericardial effusion given negative CTA.  Slight delayed bubbles on TTE
   raise possiblity of pulmonary AVMs.    No profound anemia.  Has
   appearance of CHF on CXR, however has not improved with diuresis, BNP
   not significantly elevated and hypoxia seems out of proportion to other
   findings, no elevated JVP.    Unclear etiology. CT did not show
   impressive septation suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  Consider
   inflammatory process, sarcoid, SLE especially in setting of
   mediastinal LAD.  LAD also suspicious for neoplasm, although unclear
   how this would explain hypoxia based on CT.
   - f/u b-glucan, galactomann
   - TTE final read, nl EF, MR unchanged, delayed bubbles, insetting of nl
   EF and hypotension with ACEI, d/c
d captopril
   - Continue levofloxacin for possible CAP
   - PPD planted yesterday, will need to be read tomorrow.
   #LFT abnormalities:  Pt has transaminitis >1000s, AST/ALT ratio ~2:1.
   Ddx for this degree of transaminitis includes ETOH hepatitis,
   medications (ie tylenol), shock liver, viral hepatitis.  Less likely
   [**Location (un) 2325**]
s, autoimmune. Consider HHC as  Fe/TIBC ration close to 45%.
   TSH WNL.  [**Doctor First Name 1205**] positive with high/normal titer.  Hepatitis serologies
   negative for HBV, HCV and acute HAV.  Given the rapid downward trend in
   pt
s LFTs, more likely to be acute infectious or toxic process.
   - Hepatology input appreciated, covering with doxycycline empirically
   for leptospira.
   - TTG nl, sprue unlikely
   -acetaminophen nl
   -f/u vHHC mutation, ceruloplasmin, 24 urine copper collection
   -continue to trend LFTs.
   # Hyponatremia
 Free h20 restriction.
   -Check urine lytes
   -Continue to monitor
   #Thrombotytopenia.  Nl platelets 2 years ago, 115 on admission, 88
   now.  No stigmata of liver disease on exam.  LDH markedly elevated.
   Ddx for thrombocytopenia most likely is liver disease versus medication
   effect.  Combination of elevated LDH and ferritin in setting of
   enlarged spleen and neurologic abnormalities is suggestive of HLH
   however does not meet criteria.
   -check peripheral smear
   -fibrinogen low but FDP nl, not picture of DIC
   -continue to monitor.
   -Transfuse platelets for <50 if actively bleeding.
   -no need for heparin SC at this time for PPX given low platelets with
   abnomal coags

","The patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation. She presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and shortness of breath, and was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes unexplained hypoxia with tachycardia and tachypnea, abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, hearing loss, altered mental status, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, low-grade fever, and an abnormal brain MRI.

The differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), pericardial effusion, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and inflammatory processes such as sarcoidosis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Other possible causes mentioned include tuberculosis (TB), syphilis, infectious etiologies like viral meningitis or encephalitis, lymphoma, and neurosarcoidosis.

The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and other abnormalities. The assessment plan includes consulting infectious disease for assistance with empiric antibiotics and suggestions for workup of infectious etiology of symptoms, as well as requesting a lumbar puncture (LP) to investigate possible central nervous system involvement.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient may be at risk for further deterioration in oxygenation due to the unexplained"

   Assessment and Plan
   48F with confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities, as
   of yet unexplained: hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss,
   altered mental status,  elevated LFTs, thrombocytopenia, mediastinal
   LAD, leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abdnormal CSF.
   #Abnormal MRI: In setting of confusing  constellation of symptoms which
   we would like to tie together into unifying diagnosis, the presence of
   CNS involvement, specifically the leptomeninges raises concern for
   possible infectious etiologies: less likely typical bacterial
   meningitis due to duration of symptoms, consider viral etiologies (HSV,
   CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6), TB, Syphilis, ehrilichia, leptospira, lyme;
   lymphoma, inflammatory conditions: neurosarcoidosis, SLE.  LP yesterday
   very difficulty with low opening pressures and low CSF yield.  Very
   limited in initial studies able to perform.  On early results CSF is
   abnormal for 250 WBC with elevated protein and 73%
other
 cells on
   differential.  Contact[**Name (NI) **] by heme path with early impression CSF being
   cellular with apparently reactive lymphocytes, they recommend flow
   cytometry to further characterize.  At this point differential remains
   broad.  RPR is positive, however not necessarily c/w syphillis as false
   positive in many of other conditions we are considering, also remain
   concerned for CNS malignancy, inflammatory d/o, viral or atypical
   bacterial infection.
   -appreciate neuro assistance, priority today to repeat LP with goal of
   sending 4cc for cytology to general path and 4cc to heme path for flow
   cytometry, needs to be hand carried to heme path lab on 3^rd floor,
   resident to arrange [**Numeric Identifier 2388**].
   -appreciate ID involvement. Will prioritize additional studies to
   include first EBV, CMV and VZV PCR, lower on list is HSV and HHV6 PCR,
   would also like TB culture or PCR whichever has lower volume
   requirement.
   -f/u VDRL, lyme serologies
   -hold on add
l antimicrobials for now.
   -difficult blood draw today, did not have enough sample for
   cryptococcal ag, EBV or CMV VL.  Will re-attempt this afternoon.
   # PULM: Tachypnea and hypoxia/mediastinal LAD
Current differential
   diagnosis includes CHF, pneumonia, unlikely PCP given HIV negative
   status, unlikely  PE or pericardial effusion given negative CTA.
   Slight delayed bubbles on TTE raise possiblity of pulmonary AVMs.    No
   profound anemia.  Has appearance of CHF on CXR, however has not
   improved with diuresis, BNP not significantly elevated and hypoxia
   seems out of proportion to other findings, no elevated JVP.    Unclear
   etiology. CT did not show impressive septation suggestive of pulmonary
   fibrosis.  Consider inflammatory process, sarcoid, SLE especially in
   setting of  mediastinal LAD.  LAD also suspicious for neoplasm,
   although unclear how this would explain hypoxia based on CT.  Has
   persistent 02 requirement of 5-6L, desats when laying down.

   intubation.
   -supplemental 02 prn.
   #LFT abnormalities:  Pt has transaminitis >1000s, AST/ALT ratio ~2:1.
   Ddx for this degree of transaminitis includes ETOH hepatitis,
   medications (ie tylenol), shock liver, viral hepatitis.  Less likely

   negative for HBV, HCV and acute HAV.  Given the rapid downward trend in

   #Thrombotytopenia.  Nl platelets 2 years ago, 115 on admission, 88
   now.  No stigmata of liver disease on exam.  LDH markedly elevated.
   Ddx for thrombocytopenia most likely is liver disease versus medication
   effect.  Combination of elevated LDH and ferritin in setting of
   enlarged spleen and neurologic abnormalities is suggestive of HLH
   however does not meet criteria.  Pt had low platelets on admission with
   steady drop.  Timing not c/w HIT.  Still avoiding heparin products for
   bleeding risk but ok to get for lines if necessary.   Peripheral smear
   showed thrombocytopenia with large platelets.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities. The patient presents with hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAD). An MRI brain showed leptomeningeal enhancement. The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests including lumbar puncture (LP), blood cultures, and various laboratory studies.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.6°C, heart rate (HR) of 114 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 94/55 mmHg to 118/73 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 91% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include anxiety, alertness, and orientation. The patient has diminished breath sounds without rales, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and a palpable spleen tip. Neurological examination was not performed due to patient's altered mental status.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.5 K/uL, elevated hematocrit (Hct) of 42.0%, elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) in the thousands with an AST"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation. She presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, shortness of breath, and was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her current condition and ongoing investigations. Some potential medical complications include:

1. Infectious etiologies: The presence of CNS involvement with leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI raises concern for possible infectious etiologies such as viral (HSV, CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6) meningitis or encephalitis, tuberculosis, syphilis, ehrlichiosis, leptospirosis, or lyme disease. An infectious disease consultation has been requested to assist with any necessary empiric antibiotic coverage and suggestions for workup of infectious etiology of symptoms.

2. Lymphoma or inflammatory conditions: The mediastinal lymphadenopathy and abnormal brain MRI findings may also raise the possibility of lymphoma or inflammatory conditions like neurosarcoidosis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Further evaluation and consultation with relevant specialists may be needed.

3. Pulmonary embolism or pulmonary arterial venous malformations: The presence of delayed bubbles on TTE raises the possibility of pulmonary arterial venous malformations (PAVMs), which can cause hypoxia. A computed tomography angi"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 48 y.o.f. with mitral valve prolapse and mitral
   regurgitation who presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, and
   shortness of breath, transferred to ICU for hypoxia.  Currently with as
   of yet unexplained hypoxia with tachycardia and tachypnea, abnormal
   LFTs, thrombocytopenia, hearing loss, altered mental status,
   mediastinal lymphadenopathy, low grade fever, and now an abnormal brain
   MRI.
   #Abnormal MRI: In setting of confusing  constellation of symptoms which
   we would like to tie together into unifying diagnosis, the presence of
   CNS involvement, specifically the leptomeninges raises concern for
   possible infectious etiologies: less likely typical bacterial
   meningitis due to duration of symptoms, consider viral etiologies (HSV,
   CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6), TB, Syphilis, ehrilichia, leptospira, lyme;
   lymphoma, inflammatory conditions: neurosarcoidosis, SLE.
   -appreciate neuro assistance, recommend LP
   -will consult ID with assistance with any necessary empiric abx and
   with suggestions for work up of infectious etiology of symptoms.
   -f/u RPR
   # Tachypnea and hypoxia
Current differential diagnosis includes CHF,
   pneumonia, unlikely PCP given HIV negative status, unlikely  PE or
   pericardial effusion given negative CTA.  Slight delayed bubbles on TTE
   raise possiblity of pulmonary AVMs.    No profound anemia.  Has
   appearance of CHF on CXR, however has not improved with diuresis, BNP
   not significantly elevated and hypoxia seems out of proportion to other
   findings, no elevated JVP.    Unclear etiology. CT did not show
   impressive septation suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis.  Consider
   inflammatory process, sarcoid, SLE especially in setting of
   mediastinal LAD.  LAD also suspicious for neoplasm, although unclear
   how this would explain hypoxia based on CT.
   - f/u b-glucan, galactomann
   - TTE final read, nl EF, MR unchanged, delayed bubbles, insetting of nl
   EF and hypotension with ACEI, d/c
d captopril
   - Continue levofloxacin for possible CAP
   - PPD planted yesterday, will need to be read tomorrow.
   #LFT abnormalities:  Pt has transaminitis >1000s, AST/ALT ratio ~2:1.
   Ddx for this degree of transaminitis includes ETOH hepatitis,
   medications (ie tylenol), shock liver, viral hepatitis.  Less likely

   - Hepatology input appreciated, covering with doxycycline empirically
   for leptospira.

   Ddx for thrombocytopenia most likely is liver disease versus medication
   effect.  Combination of elevated LDH and ferritin in setting of
   enlarged spleen and neurologic abnormalities is suggestive of HLH
   however does not meet criteria.
   -check peripheral smear
   -fibrinogen low but FDP nl, not picture of DIC
   -continue to monitor.
   -Transfuse platelets for <50 if actively bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation. She presented with blurry vision, hearing loss, shortness of breath, and was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. She continues to experience unexplained hypoxia with tachycardia and tachypnea. Her laboratory results show abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, hearing loss, altered mental status, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, low-grade fever, and an abnormal brain MRI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious etiologies: The presence of CNS involvement, specifically leptomeningeal enhancement on the brain MRI, raises concern for possible infectious etiologies such as viral (HSV, CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6), TB, Syphilis, Ehrlichia, Leptospira, or Lyme disease. Lymphoma and inflammatory conditions like neurosarcoidosis and SLE should also be considered.
2. Pulmonary AVMs: Delayed bubbles on TTE raise the possibility of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of mitral valve prolapse and mitral regurgitation, which may contribute to her symptoms.
4. Liver disease: The patient exhibits LFT abnormalities with AST/ALT ratio of 2:1,"

   Initially presented with mild fevers, headache, nausea, hearing loss,
   hypoxemia, tachypnea, tachycardia, leukopenia. No joint inflammation or
   rashes. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]+ 1:160. CTPA neg for PE. Pleural effusions small.
   Lab data: WBC continues to rise. Thrombocytopenia worse. Cr now at
   baseline. Hyponatremia persistant. LFTs with decreased transaminases
   and LDH, rising alk phos. No coags obtained today. FENA < 10%.
   MRI brain abnormalities- leptomeningeal process
   persistant severe hypoxemia
   interstitial opacification and chest LAD which appeared to be pulmonary
   edema but seems more likely infiltrative process
   LFT abnormalities rapidly improving making more likely toxic exposure
   or acute infection. Given this chronicity I think it is likely that the
   liver abnormalities may be unrelated to the underlying process.
   progressive thrombocytopenia
   ARF resolved
   Dehydrated: thought she was in pulm edema, got diuresed with no
   improvement in oxygenation. Initial BNP 500. Tachycardia and mental
   status improved with 3L + net fluid balance today. Interstitial
   opacities may be interstitial infiltrate and not edema. Urine output

   Initially presented with mild fevers, headache, nausea, hearing loss,
   hypoxemia, tachypnea, tachycardia, leukopenia. No joint inflammation or
   rashes. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]+ 1:160. CTPA neg for PE. Pleural effusions small.
   Lab data: WBC continues to rise. Thrombocytopenia worse. Cr now at

   hypoalbuminemic.
   New CSF data.
   MRI brain abnormalities- leptomeningeal process- CSF confusing- doesn
   suggest bacterial process. Path appears reactive lymphocytes. Diff dx
   broad, including viral encephalitis, lupus cerebritis, neurosarcoid,
   less likely lymphoma, infection. It is interesting that she is
   clinically improving with hydration and CAP coverage.
   Pulmonary: persistant severe hypoxemia with interstitial opacification
   and chest LAD which appeared to be pulmonary edema but seems more
   likely infiltrative process. No improvement in oxygenation or
   radiographic appearance with diuresis. This still could be pulmonary
   edema, but it is also possible this could represent sarcoid,
   pneumonitis, less likely lymphangitic carcinomatosis given lack of h/o
   weight loss, chronicity.
   LFT abnormalities rapidly improving are more consistent with shock
   liver or toxic exposure or acute infection, but nothing in her history
   suggests these. She was never hypotensive, no lactic acidosis (just
   dehydrated) and had no h/o ingestion. With this rapid improvement it
   seems hard to attribute to sarcoid or malignancy.
   Thrombocytopenia, progressive
   ARF resolved
   Dehydrated: thought she was in pulm edema, got diuresed with no
   improvement in oxygenation. Initial BNP 500. Tachycardia and mental

   Patient is critically ill with severe hypoxemia which may require

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old woman with multiorgan dysfunction, including brain abnormalities (leptomeningeal process), hypoxemia, tachypnea, chest LAD and interstitial opacification (which appeared to be pulmonary edema but may be an infiltrative process), liver function test abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. 

The patient's condition has been improving with hydration and coverage for possible bacterial infection. However, she still has severe hypoxemia and interstitial opacification on chest imaging, which could be due to pulmonary edema, sarcoidosis, pneumonitis, or less likely lymphangitic carcinomatosis. 

The patient's liver function test abnormalities are rapidly improving, suggesting shock liver or toxic exposure or acute infection. Her thrombocytopenia is progressive, and she has resolved acute renal failure. 

The patient was initially dehydrated and thought to have pulmonary edema, but diuresis did not improve her oxygenation. Her initial B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was 500, and her mental status and tachycardia improved with aggressive fluid resuscitation and a positive net fluid balance today. 

The patient has mild hyponatremia, possibly with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), and did not adhere to free water restriction.

   Assessment and Plan
   48F with confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities, as
   of yet unexplained: hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss,
   altered mental status,  elevated LFTs, thrombocytopenia, mediastinal
   LAD, leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal CSF.
    #Abnormal MRI: In setting of confusing  constellation of symptoms
   which we would like to tie together into unifying diagnosis, the
   presence of CNS involvement, specifically the leptomeninges raises
   concern for possible infectious etiologies: less likely typical
   bacterial meningitis due to duration of symptoms, consider viral
   etiologies (HSV, CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6), TB, Syphilis, ehrilichia,
   leptospira, lyme; lymphoma, inflammatory conditions: neurosarcoidosis,
   SLE.  LP yesterday very difficulty with low opening pressures and low
   CSF yield.  Very limited in initial studies able to perform.  On early
   results CSF is abnormal for 250 WBC with elevated protein and 73%
other
 cells on differential.  Contact[**Name (NI) **] by heme path with early
   impression CSF being cellular with apparently reactive lymphocytes,
   they recommend flow cytometry to further characterize.  At this point
   differential remains broad.  RPR is positive, however not necessarily
   c/w syphillis as false positive in many of other conditions we are
   considering, also remain concerned for CNS malignancy, inflammatory
   d/o, viral or atypical bacterial infection.
   -appreciate neuro assistance, priority today to repeat LP with goal of
   sending 4cc for cytology to general path and 4cc to heme path for flow
   cytometry, needs to be hand carried to heme path lab on [**Location (un) 1508**],
   resident to arrange [**Numeric Identifier 2388**].
   -appreciate ID involvement. Will prioritize additional studies to
   include first EBV, CMV and VZV PCR, lower on list is HSV and HHV6 PCR,
   would also like TB culture or PCR whichever has lower volume
   requirement.
   -f/u VDRL, lyme serologies

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities. The patient is experiencing hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAD), and leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 114/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is anxious, alert, and oriented but still tachypneic.

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds with no audible rales, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and a palpable spleen tip. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. However, movement, tone, and asterisks are not assessed due to the patient's condition.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with neutrophils at 85.0%, bands at 4.0%, lymphocytes at 5.0%, and monocytes at 2.0%. The platelet count is 99,000/mL, and other lab values such as creatinine,"

   Assessment and Plan
   48F with confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities, as
   of yet unexplained: hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss,
   altered mental status,  elevated LFTs, thrombocytopenia, mediastinal
   LAD, leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal CSF.
    #Abnormal MRI: In setting of confusing  constellation of symptoms
   which we would like to tie together into unifying diagnosis, the
   presence of CNS involvement, specifically the leptomeninges raises
   concern for possible infectious etiologies: less likely typical
   bacterial meningitis due to duration of symptoms, consider viral
   etiologies (HSV, CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6), TB, Syphilis, ehrilichia,
   leptospira, lyme; lymphoma, inflammatory conditions: neurosarcoidosis,
   SLE.  LP yesterday very difficulty with low opening pressures and low
   CSF yield.  Very limited in initial studies able to perform.  On early
   results CSF is abnormal for 250 WBC with elevated protein and 73%
other
 cells on differential.  Contact[**Name (NI) **] by heme path with early
   impression CSF being cellular with apparently reactive lymphocytes,
   they recommend flow cytometry to further characterize.  At this point
   differential remains broad.  RPR is positive, however not necessarily
   c/w syphillis as false positive in many of other conditions we are
   considering, also remain concerned for CNS malignancy, inflammatory
   d/o, viral or atypical bacterial infection.
   -appreciate neuro assistance, priority today to repeat LP with goal of
   sending 4cc for cytology to general path and 4cc to heme path for flow
   cytometry, needs to be hand carried to heme path lab on [**Location (un) 1508**],
   resident to arrange [**Numeric Identifier 2388**].
   -appreciate ID involvement. Will prioritize additional studies to
   include first EBV, CMV and VZV PCR, lower on list is HSV and HHV6 PCR,
   would also like TB culture or PCR whichever has lower volume
   requirement.
   -f/u VDRL, lyme serologies
   -hold on add
l antimicrobials for now.
   -difficult blood draw today, did not have enough sample for
   cryptococcal ag, EBV or CMV VL.  Will re-attempt this afternoon.
   # PULM: Tachypnea and hypoxia/mediastinal LAD
Current differential
   diagnosis includes CHF, pneumonia, unlikely PCP given HIV negative
   status, unlikely  PE or pericardial effusion given negative CTA.
   Slight delayed bubbles on TTE raise possiblity of pulmonary AVMs.    No
   profound anemia.  Has appearance of CHF on CXR, however has not
   improved with diuresis, BNP not significantly elevated and hypoxia
   seems out of proportion to other findings, no elevated JVP.    Unclear
   etiology. CT did not show impressive septation suggestive of pulmonary
   fibrosis.  Consider inflammatory process, sarcoid, SLE especially in
   setting of  mediastinal LAD.  LAD also suspicious for neoplasm,
   although unclear how this would explain hypoxia based on CT.  Has
   persistent 02 requirement of 5-6L, desats when laying down.
   -PPD negative
   -f/u b-glucan, galactomannan
   -emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2384**] re ? significance of  late bubbles on TTE
   -d/c levaquin, has completed 1 week of abx for weak suspicion of PNA,
   no evidence for bacterial infection as etiology for hypoxia.
   -CT abd/pelvis this am to eval for ? add
l LAD, any target more
   amenable for biopsy than sub carinal node
   -NPO for now with consideration of bronch today, after eval CT
   abd/pelvis.  Would get platelets prior to bronch.  [**Month (only) 60**] require
   intubation.
   -supplemental 02 prn.
   #LFT abnormalities:  Pt has transaminitis >1000s, AST/ALT ratio ~2:1.
   Ddx for this degree of transaminitis includes ETOH hepatitis,
   medications (ie tylenol), shock liver, viral hepatitis.  Less likely
   [**Location (un) 2325**]
s, autoimmune. Consider HHC as  Fe/TIBC ration close to 45%.
   TSH WNL.  [**Doctor First Name 1205**] positive with high/normal titer.  Hepatitis serologies
   negative for HBV, HCV and acute HAV.  Given the rapid downward trend in
   pt
s LFTs, more likely to be acute infectious or toxic process.
   - Hepatology input appreciated, covering with doxycycline empirically
   for leptospira.  Have d/w ID, will continue for now, re-evaluate when
   serologies back.
   - TTG nl, sprue unlikely
   -acetaminophen nl
   -f/u vHHC mutation, ceruloplasmin, 24 urine copper collection results
   pending.
   -continue to trend LFTs.
    #Hyperkalemia- K 5.7 this am in moderately hemolyzed specimen
   -repeat K at noon
   -check EKG
   # Hyponatremia
 Na decreased further from 132 to 128.  Pt reportedly
   not compliant with fluid restriction. On yesterday
s urine lytes,
   feUrea nl but urine Na <10, with elevated urine osm, most c/w
   hypovolemic hyponatremia, esp as pt
s HR and BUN/Cr have declined
   overnight with IVF challenge.
   -Continue free h20 restriction
   -1L NS bolus this am with maintenance NS while NPO
   -repeat Na this afternoon
   -Continue to monitor
   #Thrombotytopenia.  Nl platelets 2 years ago, 115 on admission, 88
   now.  No stigmata of liver disease on exam.  LDH markedly elevated.
   Ddx for thrombocytopenia most likely is liver disease versus medication
   effect.  Combination of elevated LDH and ferritin in setting of
   enlarged spleen and neurologic abnormalities is suggestive of HLH
   however does not meet criteria.  Pt had low platelets on admission with
   steady drop.  Timing not c/w HIT.  Still avoiding heparin products for
   bleeding risk but ok to get for lines if necessary.   Peripheral smear
   showed thrombocytopenia with large platelets.
   -fibrinogen low but FDP nl, not picture of DIC
   -d/c levaquin as above, may cause thrombocytopenia
   -Transfuse platelets for <50, have active T+S ready

Further evaluation is recommended, including repeating the lumbar puncture (LP) to obtain more CSF for cytology and flow cytometry, as well as additional studies to include PCR tests for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), among others. The patient's pulmonary symptoms may be due to congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), pericardial effusion, or pulmonary arterial malformations.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo woman with multisystem abnormalities including brain, lung,
   lymphadenopathy, liver, platelets:
   Initially presented with mild fevers, headache, nausea, hearing loss,
   hypoxemia, tachypnea, tachycardia, leukopenia. No joint inflammation or
   rashes. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]+ 1:160. CTPA neg for PE. Exam has never suggested
   meningismus or significant encephalitis.
   Lab data: WBC continues to rise on steroids. Thrombocytopenia and LFTs
   rapidly normalizing. Hyponatremia improving on NS. Severely
   hypoalbuminemic.
   MRI brain abnormalities- leptomeningeal process- but without clinical
   meningitis or encephalitis- CSF confusing- doesn
t suggest bacterial
   process. Path appears reactive lymphocytes.
   Pulmonary: persistant severe hypoxemia with interstitial opacification
   and chest LAD which appeared to be pulmonary edema but also possibly
   infiltrative/inflammatory process.
   Resp status improved despite 3L+.
   LFT abnormalities again markedly improved. Seems more consistent with
   postinflammatory hepatitis, acute infection. No period of hyptotension
   to explain shock liver, no h/o toxic ingestion. With this rapid
   improvement it seems hard to attribute to sarcoid or malignancy, but
   that remains in the differential.
   Diff dx extremely broad. Greatly value ID and neuro input.
   Overall she has improved in mental status (less fatigued, more
   alert/interactive
though perhaps this is because she was very
   dehydrated and has been approx 14L net positive over LOS, not
   accounting for insensible losses), marked improvement in LFTs,
   platelets. Respiratory status is a little confusing: she is breathing
   much more comfortably today despite >3L+ but she has a persistant very
   high FiO2 requirement. Antibiotics were stopped yesterday morning so
   she has had this clinical improvement on doxy/[**Last Name (LF) 2402**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she has some
   process that either is resolving spontaneously or responsive to those
   abx.
   Infectious:
          viral encephalitis (EBV, CMV, VZV)
          viral infection with systemic infection inducing acute
   hepatitis and concomitant CHF or viral pneumonia
          ID service raises question of lymphocytochoriomeningitis
   virus (rodent vector)
          Bacterial infections that may have responded would include
   erlichiosis, leptospirosis, q fever. (She has been dealing with mice in
   her house.)
          post-infectious inflammatory injury: secondary to viral
   infection or mycoplasma
   -          mycoplasma could cause postinfectious encephalitis with
   liver involvement and myocarditis that might make her more prone to CHF
   noninfectious
          lymphoma with pulm edema or lymphangitic spread
   less likely:
          lupus cerebritis
          neurosarcoid
          malignancy with lymphangitic carcinomatosis- odd that LFTs
   would be improving so quickly but concerning given severe hypoxemia
 LP data pending, will have flow this afternoon
 will hold off on bronch because I think the yield is fairly low and
   she would have to be intubated for procedure given her hypoxemia and
   anxiety. The main diagnoses that would be revealed by bronch are the
   noninfectious, and do not require urgent intervention, such as
   lymphoma, sarcoid, lymphangitic spread.
   Thrombocytopenia, improving rapidly.
   Coagulopathy with INR 1.4, PTT 28.2.
   ARF resolved
   Dehydrated: thought she was in pulm edema, got diuresed with no
   improvement in oxygenation. Initial BNP 500. Tachycardia and mental
   status improved with 3L + net fluid balance today. Urine output approx
   70cc/h.
   Mild hyponatremia - possibly with SIADH- improving with NS
   resuscitation.
   DVT prophylaxis- will restart sc heparin after bronch as plt count
   nearly normal, on pneumoboots.

The patient is a 48-year-old woman with multiple organ dysfunction, including brain abnormalities with leptomeningeal process, severe hypoxemia, tachypnea, chest LAD and interstitial opacification (possibly pulmonary edema or infiltrative process), liver function test abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, and other systemic issues. 

The patient's condition has shown some improvement in mental status, LFTs, and platelet count. However, she still requires a high FiO2 requirement and has persistent severe hypoxemia. Antibiotics were stopped yesterday morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows interstitial opacification and pulmonary edema, indicating a possible complication of fluid overload or heart failure.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can lead to bleeding complications such as spontaneous bleeding or increased risk of bleeding with invasive procedures.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo woman with multisystem abnormalities including brain, lung,
   lymphadenopathy, liver, platelets:
   Initially presented with mild fevers, headache, nausea, hearing loss,
   hypoxemia, tachypnea, tachycardia, leukopenia. No joint inflammation or
   rashes. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]+ 1:160. CTPA neg for PE. Exam has never suggested
   meningismus or significant encephalitis.
   Lab data: WBC continues to rise on steroids. Thrombocytopenia and LFTs
   rapidly normalizing. Hyponatremia improving on NS. Severely
   hypoalbuminemic.
   MRI brain abnormalities- leptomeningeal process- but without clinical
   meningitis or encephalitis- CSF confusing- doesn
t suggest bacterial
   process. Path appears reactive lymphocytes.
   Pulmonary: persistant severe hypoxemia with interstitial opacification
   and chest LAD
   DDx: pulmonary edema, infiltrative/inflammatory process, inflammation
   and capillary leak with noncardiogenic pulm edema.
   Resp status improved despite 3L+.
   LFT abnormalities again markedly improved. Seems more consistent with
   postinflammatory hepatitis, acute infection. No period of hyptotension
   to explain shock liver, no h/o toxic ingestion. With this rapid
   improvement it seems hard to attribute to sarcoid or malignancy, but
   that remains in the differential.
   Diff dx extremely broad. Greatly value ID and neuro input.
   Overall she has improved in mental status (less fatigued, more
   alert/interactive
though perhaps this is because she was very
   dehydrated and has been approx 14L net positive over LOS, not
   accounting for insensible losses), marked improvement in LFTs,
   platelets. Respiratory status is a little confusing: she is breathing
   much more comfortably today despite >3L+ but she has a persistant very
   high FiO2 requirement. Antibiotics were stopped yesterday morning so
   she has had this clinical improvement on doxy/[**Last Name (LF) 2402**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she has some
   process that either is resolving spontaneously or responsive to those
   abx.
   Infectious:
          viral encephalitis (EBV, CMV, VZV, arbovirus)
          viral infection with systemic infection inducing acute
   hepatitis and concomitant CHF or viral pneumonia
          ID service raises question of lymphocytochoriomeningitis
   virus (rodent vector)
          Bacterial infections that may have responded would include
   erlichiosis, leptospirosis, q fever. (She has been dealing with mice in
   her house.)
          post-infectious inflammatory injury: secondary to viral
   infection or mycoplasma
   -          mycoplasma could cause postinfectious encephalitis with
   liver involvement and myocarditis that might make her more prone to CHF
   less likely: noninfectious
          lymphoma with pulm edema or lymphangitic spread
          lupus cerebritis
          neurosarcoid
          malignancy with lymphangitic carcinomatosis- odd that LFTs
   would be improving so quickly but concerning given severe hypoxemia
 LP data pending, will have flow this afternoon
 will hold off on bronch because I think the yield is fairly low and
   she would have to be intubated for procedure given her hypoxemia and
   anxiety. The main diagnoses that would be revealed by bronch are the
   noninfectious, and do not require urgent intervention, such as
   lymphoma, sarcoid, lymphangitic spread.
   Volume status confusing
initially thought to be in pulm edema, but echo
   showed IVC small and collapsed with respirations indicating no
   increased RAP, and got diuresed (-1.5L) with no improvement in
   oxygenation. Initial BNP 500. Tachycardia and mental status improved
   with 3L + net fluid balance today.
   Thrombocytopenia, improving rapidly.
   Coagulopathy with INR 1.4, PTT 28.2.
   ARF resolved
   Mild hyponatremia - possibly with SIADH- improving with NS
   resuscitation.
   DVT prophylaxis- will restart sc heparin after bronch as plt count
   nearly normal, on pneumoboots.

She initially presented with mild fevers, headache, nausea, hearing loss, hypoxemia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and leukopenia. There are no joint inflammation or rashes. The doctor suspects a potential infectious cause for her symptoms, including viral encephalitis, viral infection with systemic involvement, bacterial infections such as erlichiosis, leptospirosis, or Q fever, or post-infectious inflammatory injury secondary to viral infection or mycoplasma.

The patient's lab data shows a rising white blood cell count, rapidly normalizing thrombocytopenia and liver function tests, improving hyponatremia, and severely hypoalbuminemic. MRI brain abnormalities indicate a leptomeningeal process without clinical meningitis or encephalitis. The CSF findings are confusing and do not suggest a bacterial process, with reactive lymphocytes observed. Pulmonary findings include severe hypoxemia with interstitial opacification and chest LAD, which could be due to pulmonary edema, infiltrative/inflammatory process, or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

   48 yo woman with multisystem abnormalities including brain, lung,
   lymphadenopathy, liver, platelets:
   Initially presented with mild fevers, headache, nausea, hearing loss,
   hypoxemia, tachypnea, tachycardia, leukopenia. No joint inflammation or
   rashes. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]+ 1:160. CTPA neg for PE. Pleural effusions small.
   Lab data: WBC continues to rise. Thrombocytopenia worse. Cr now at
   baseline. Hyponatremia persistant. LFTs with decreased transaminases
   and LDH, rising alk phos. No coags obtained today. FENA < 10%. Severely
   hypoalbuminemic.
   New CSF data pending.
   MRI brain abnormalities- leptomeningeal process- CSF confusing- doesn
   suggest bacterial process. Path appears reactive lymphocytes. Diff dx
   broad, including viral encephalitis, lupus cerebritis, neurosarcoid,
   less likely lymphoma, infection. Continues to clinically improve with
   hydration and off antibiotics (stopped yesterday morning).
   Repeat LP done.
   Pulmonary: persistant severe hypoxemia with interstitial opacification
   and chest LAD which appeared to be pulmonary edema but seems more
   likely infiltrative process. No improvement in oxygenation or
   radiographic appearance with diuresis. This still could be pulmonary
   edema, but it is also possible this could represent sarcoid,
   pneumonitis, less likely lymphangitic carcinomatosis given lack of h/o
   weight loss, chronicity.  Resp status improved despite 3L+.
   LFT abnormalities again markedly improved. Seems more consistent with
   shock liver or toxic exposure or acute infection, but nothing in her
   history suggests these. She was never hypotensive, no lactic acidosis
   (just dehydrated) and had no h/o ingestion. With this rapid improvement
   it seems hard to attribute to sarcoid or malignancy.
   Thrombocytopenia, improving rapidly.
   Coagulopathy with INR 1.4, PTT 28.2.
   ARF resolved
   Dehydrated: thought she was in pulm edema, got diuresed with no
   improvement in oxygenation. Initial BNP 500. Tachycardia and mental
   status improved with 3L + net fluid balance today. Urine output approx
   70cc/h.
   Mild hyponatremia - possibly with SIADH- improving with NS
   resuscitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo woman with multisystem abnormalities including brain, lung,
   lymphadenopathy, liver, platelets:
   Initially presented with mild fevers, headache, nausea, hearing loss,
   hypoxemia, tachypnea, tachycardia, leukopenia. No joint inflammation or
   rashes. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]+ 1:160. CTPA neg for PE. Pleural effusions small.
   Lab data: WBC continues to rise. Thrombocytopenia worse. Cr now at
   baseline. Hyponatremia persistant. LFTs with decreased transaminases
   and LDH, rising alk phos. No coags obtained today. FENA < 10%. Severely
   hypoalbuminemic.
   New CSF data pending.
   MRI brain abnormalities- leptomeningeal process- CSF confusing- doesn
   suggest bacterial process. Path appears reactive lymphocytes. Diff dx
   broad, including viral encephalitis, lupus cerebritis, neurosarcoid,
   less likely lymphoma, infection. Continues to clinically improve with
   hydration and off antibiotics (stopped yesterday morning).
   Repeat LP done.
   Pulmonary: persistant severe hypoxemia with interstitial opacification
   and chest LAD which appeared to be pulmonary edema but seems more
   likely infiltrative process. No improvement in oxygenation or
   radiographic appearance with diuresis. This still could be pulmonary
   edema, but it is also possible this could represent sarcoid,
   pneumonitis, less likely lymphangitic carcinomatosis given lack of h/o
   weight loss, chronicity.  Resp status improved despite 3L+.
   LFT abnormalities again markedly improved. Seems more consistent with
   shock liver or toxic exposure or acute infection, but nothing in her
   history suggests these. She was never hypotensive, no lactic acidosis
   (just dehydrated) and had no h/o ingestion. With this rapid improvement
   it seems hard to attribute to sarcoid or malignancy.
   Thrombocytopenia, improving rapidly.
   Coagulopathy with INR 1.4, PTT 28.2.
   ARF resolved
   Dehydrated: thought she was in pulm edema, got diuresed with no
   improvement in oxygenation. Initial BNP 500. Tachycardia and mental
   status improved with 3L + net fluid balance today. Urine output approx
   70cc/h.
   Mild hyponatremia - possibly with SIADH- improving with NS
   resuscitation.
   DVT prophylaxis- will restart sc heparin after bronch as plt count
   nearly normal, on pneumoboots.
   Double lumen picc.

","The patient is a 48-year-old woman with multiorgan dysfunction, including brain abnormalities, severe hypoxemia, tachypnea, chest LAD and interstitial opacification, LFT abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia. She was initially presenting with mild fevers, headache, nausea, hearing loss, hypoxemia, tachypnea, tachycardia, and leukopenia. The patient's condition has been improving with hydration and off antibiotics. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to severe hypoxemia and interstitial opacification.
2. Infection due to leukopenia and persistent mild fever.
3. Liver dysfunction indicated by abnormal LFTs.
4. Thrombocytopenia which can lead to bleeding complications.
5. Coagulopathy indicated by elevated INR and PTT.
6. Acute kidney injury or acute renal failure.
7. Dehydration indicated by hyponatremia and fluid balance.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and thrombocytopenia.
9. Stress ulcers due to critical illness.
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.

Please note that this is a summary of the information provided in the progress note, and it is not an exhaustive list of all potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   48F with confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities, as
   of yet unexplained: hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss,
   altered mental status,  elevated LFTs, thrombocytopenia, mediastinal
   LAD, leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal CSF.
    #Abnormal MRI: meningeal enhancement, but LP still not diagnostic.
   WBC/RBC present, but other serologies still pending.  Cultures still
   pending.  Differential still broad; though seems to be most likely
   viral or rheumatologic rather than bacterial, though still possible
   - neuro repeated LP this AM.  Awaiting flow cytometry.  New cell counts
   with more lymphocytosis rather than atypicals
   -appreciate ID involvement. All serologies currently pending.  Will f/u
   ID recs
   - restart doxycycline for now until leptospira serology returns
   -f/u treponemal antibody. Lyme negative
   - f/u CSF cultures
   - cont doxy per ID recs for ? leptospirosis.  Awaiting serologies
   # Pulm: unclear etiology; still has O2 requirement, and continues to be
   tachypneic.  Unlikely to be pulmonary edema especially since patient is
   now net positive, but is doing better renal/tachycardia.
   -PPD negative
   -after discussing with cards, felt that late bubbles on ECHO are
   consistent with pulm AVMs
   -CT abdomen/pelvis did not reveal any lymphadenopathy, but did show
   ascites.  It is possible that she is third spacing fluid into her
   lungs, but is intra-vascular volume deplete
   -supplemental 02 prn.
   #LFT abnormalities:  Improving; still no clear etiology.
   - Hepatology input appreciated, covering with doxycycline empirically
   for leptospira.  Have d/w ID, will continue for now, re-evaluate when
   serologies back.
   -f/u vHHC mutation, ceruloplasmin, 24 urine copper collection results
   pending.
   -continue to trend LFTs.
    #Hyperkalemia- resolved; cont to monitor
   # Hyponatremia
 improved with
   #Thrombotytopenia.  Nl platelets 2 years ago, 115 on admission, 88
   now.  No stigmata of liver disease on exam.  LDH markedly elevated.
   Ddx for thrombocytopenia most likely is liver disease versus medication
   effect.  Combination of elevated LDH and ferritin in setting of
   enlarged spleen and neurologic abnormalities is suggestive of HLH
   however does not meet criteria.  Pt had low platelets on admission with
   steady drop.  Timing not c/w HIT.  Still avoiding heparin products for
   bleeding risk but ok to get for lines if necessary.   Peripheral smear
   showed thrombocytopenia with large platelets.
   -fibrinogen low but FDP nl, not picture of DIC
   -d/c levaquin as above, may cause thrombocytopenia
   -Transfuse platelets for <50, have active T+S ready
   -no need for heparin SC at this time for PPX given low platelets with

","The patient is a 48-year-old female with a confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities, including hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The patient's 24-hour events include the placement of a percutaneous central venous catheter (PICC line), an electrocardiogram (EKG), and blood cultures. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed with minimal oral contrast due to the patient's intolerance, showing no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, ascites, and moderate bilateral pleural effusions mostly consistent with third spacing. The patient also has diffuse hypodense thickening of the stomach likely due to volume overload, but cannot be ruled out for pathology such as gastric lymphoma.

The patient's allergies include Azithromycin (oral), and she has been experiencing fever with a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit). Her vital signs include a heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 114/62 mmHg to 120/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula, and a sinus rhythm.

   Assessment and Plan
   48F with confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities, as
   of yet unexplained: hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss,
   altered mental status,  elevated LFTs, thrombocytopenia, mediastinal
   LAD, leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal CSF.
    #Abnormal MRI: meningeal enhancement, but LP still not diagnostic.
   WBC/RBC present, but other serologies still pending.  Cultures still
   pending.  Differential still broad; though seems to be most likely
   viral or rheumatologic rather than bacterial, though still possible
   - neuro repeated LP this AM.  Awaiting flow cytometry.  New cell counts
   with more lymphocytosis rather than atypicals
   -appreciate ID involvement. All serologies currently pending.  Will f/u
   ID recs
   - restart doxycycline for now until leptospira serology returns
   -f/u treponemal antibody. Lyme negative
   - f/u CSF cultures
   - cont doxy per ID recs for ? leptospirosis.  Awaiting serologies
   # Pulm: unclear etiology; still has O2 requirement, and continues to be
   tachypneic.  Unlikely to be pulmonary edema especially since patient is
   now net positive, but is doing better renal/tachycardia.
   -PPD negative
   -after discussing with cards, felt that late bubbles on ECHO are
   consistent with pulm AVMs
   -CT abdomen/pelvis did not reveal any lymphadenopathy, but did show
   ascites.  It is possible that she is third spacing fluid into her
   lungs, but is intra-vascular volume deplete
   -supplemental 02 prn.
   #LFT abnormalities:  Improving; still no clear etiology.
   - Hepatology input appreciated, covering with doxycycline empirically
   for leptospira.  Have d/w ID, will continue for now, re-evaluate when
   serologies back.
   -f/u vHHC mutation, ceruloplasmin, 24 urine copper collection results
   pending.
   -continue to trend LFTs.
    #Hyperkalemia- resolved; cont to monitor
   # Hyponatremia
 improved with free water restriction and fluid
   boluses.  Con
t to monitor for now.
   -          con
t free water restriction
   -          hydration PRN
   #Thrombocytopenia- improving plt count.
   - not likely DIC based on labs.  Levofloxacin has stopped.  Possibly
   pantoprozole but unlikely.
   - hold hep sc for now; may consider restarting tomorrow if platelets
   are stable; on pneumoboots
   -Transfuse platelets for <50, have active T+S ready

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female presenting with a confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities. The main findings include hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAD), and leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including an EKG, PICC line placement, blood cultures, abdominal CT scan with minimal PO contrast, and lumbar puncture (LP). The abdominal CT scan showed no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, ascites, and moderate bilateral pleural effusions mostly consistent with third spacing, as well as diffuse hypodense thickening of the stomach likely due to volume overload, but ruling out pathology such as gastric lymphoma.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/62 to 120/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals tachycardia, inability to appreciate mitral regurgitation (MRG), rapid shallow breathing, bilateral breath sounds throughout lung fields, warm skin without rash or jaundice,"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female presenting with a confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities. The patient's symptoms include hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAD), and leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The patient has undergone several diagnostic procedures, including lumbar puncture (LP), blood cultures, and imaging studies. The LP showed the presence of lymphocytes but no atypicals, indicating a viral or rheumatologic cause rather than bacterial. However, the CSF analysis is still pending, along with other serological tests.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), liver enzymes, troponin-T, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphorus (PO4). The platelet count is also low.

The patient's condition has been assessed and plans have been made accordingly. The differential diagnosis is broad, with viral or rheumatologic causes being more likely than bacterial. The patient is currently being treated empirically with doxycycline for leptospira and will continue until the serologies return. Other tests, such as flow cytometry, are pending. The patient's pulmonary, liver function test (LFT), thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia issues are being managed based on their respective assessments.

The patient's nutrition is a concern due to poor oral intake and inadequate alimentation in the ICU. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's respiratory status, development of sepsis or septic shock due to the abnormal CSF findings, progression of liver dysfunction, further decline in platelet count leading to bleeding complications, and malnutrition-related complications.

Overall, the patient's clinical presentation suggests a systemic inflammatory response with involvement of multiple organ systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, hepatic, and hematological systems. Further diagnostic workup and management are necessary to determine the underlying cause and guide treatment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female presenting with a confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities. These include hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAD), and leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The patient has been experiencing fever, and blood cultures have shown no growth to date. The CSF analysis revealed an elevated white blood cell count with lymphocytosis, but no atypical cells were seen. Serologies are still pending, and the patient is awaiting further tests, including flow cytometry and additional CSF cultures.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (azithromycin and doxycycline), antivirals, and supportive care. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing hypoxia and tachypnea. A chest CT scan showed moderate bilateral pleural effusion and ascites, which may indicate third spacing of fluid.

The patient's LFT abnormalities are improving, but the exact cause is still unknown. Empirical treatment for leptospirosis has been initiated. The patient's thrombocytopenia is improving, and it is unlikely to be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities, including hypoxia, tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAD), and leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient has undergone several tests and treatments, including lumbar puncture, blood cultures, antibiotics, and imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aseptic Meningitis: The patient's symptoms and findings from the CSF analysis suggest a possible case of aseptic meningitis. This condition includes a range of causes such as viral, tuberculous, fungal, neoplastic, or systemic illnesses like Sjogren syndrome or sarcoidosis.
2. Pulmonary Issues: The patient's respiratory symptoms, including hypoxia and tachypnea, may be due to an unclear etiology. Pulmonary embolism (PE) has been considered, but ruled out based on the absence of pulmonary edema and the presence of ascites. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have been suggested as a possible cause for the late bubbles on echocardiography.
3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's elevated LFTs have not yet been explained. Empirical coverage"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. No pathologically enlarged mesenteric, retroperitoneal or pelvic or
   inguinal nodes are noted.
   2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left and
   moderate
   amount of ascites is noted in the peritoneal cavity. This appearance is
   mostly consistent with third spacing.
   3. Apparent diffuse hypodense thickening of the stomach. Although this
   appearance is mostly due to contraction and fluid overload, an
   underlying
   pathology such as gastric lymphoma can not be excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   48F with confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities, as
   of yet unexplained: hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss,
   altered mental status,  elevated LFTs, thrombocytopenia, mediastinal
   LAD, leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal CSF.
    #Abnormal MRI: meningeal enhancement, LP cellular with reactive
   lymphocytes.  No growth on cultures, no microorganisms on gram stain.
   Ddx for aseptic meningitis includes [**Female First Name (un) **], TB, fungal, spirochete,
   neoplastic or related to systemic illness (SLE, sarcoid, Behcet
   Sjogren

   cytometry (reactive lymphocytes, no malignant cells).
   -Follow up viral cultures and other CSF studies
   -Continue doxycycline for leptospirosis coverage until leptospira ab
   negative
   -Consider rheum consult for ? work up for possible Sjogren

   # Pulm: unclear etiology; still has O2 requirement, and continues to be
   tachypneic.  Unlikely to be pulmonary edema especially since patient is
   now net positive, but is doing better renal/tachycardia.
   -PPD negative
   -after discussing with cards, felt that late bubbles on ECHO are
   consistent with pulm AVMs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities. The symptoms include hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAD), and leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient has undergone various tests and procedures, including lumbar puncture, blood cultures, serologies, and imaging studies.

The patient's condition has been managed with different medications and interventions, including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care. The patient is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to profound malnutrition and poor oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aseptic Meningitis: The patient's presentation with meningeal enhancement on MRI and abnormal CSF raises the possibility of aseptic meningitis. Further evaluation is needed to identify the underlying cause.
2. Pulmonary Issues: The patient continues to experience tachypnea and requires supplemental oxygen. The etiology of these pulmonary symptoms is unclear, but potential causes may include pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, or pulmonary arterial venous malformations (AVMs).
3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's LFTs are elevated, but the cause is still unknown. Hepatology input"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female admit with tachypnea, tachycardia, altered mental status
   and lymphocyctosis in CSF but to date inability to establish unifying
   diagnosis.  Given dynamic insults and fluctuating findings a viral
   course of illness seems quite possible.  The problem with that is we
   are negative to date for all testing to determine final answer.  This
   morning patient has persistent resting tachypnea and tachycardia but
   overall has had some improvement in oxygen requirement.
   1)Tachypnea-
   -This appears to be correlated with what is impressive loss of lung
   volumes over time.  The differential for this specific issue may be as
   simple as de-recruitment in the setting of illness and bed rest.  What
   is also possible is there may be progressive restriction at the level
   of the pulmonary parenchyma or chest wall with pleural effisions.  In
   addition neuromuscular weakness could certainly contibute as well.
   -Will pursue incentive spirometry, oob
chair and IPPV today to attempt
   to recruit
   -Will check NIF to evaluate for possible weakness
   -If persistent compromise seen despite this it may well represent
   progressive restriction and parenchymal involvement be considered with
   repeat CT
   2)Leptomeningeal Process-
   -Follow up cultures and testing
   -Repeat LP reassuring thus far
   -Will follow up evaluation
   3)LFT Abnormalities-
   -Improving with observation and continue to track.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female admitted to the ICU with symptoms of tachypnea, tachycardia, altered mental status, and lymphocytosis in CSF. Despite various tests, no unifying diagnosis has been established. The patient's condition seems to fluctuate, making a viral illness possible but difficult to confirm without further testing. The patient's resting tachypnea and tachycardia persist, although there has been some improvement in oxygen requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tachypnea:
- The patient's rapid breathing may be due to de-recruitment in the setting of illness and bed rest.
- Progressive restriction at the level of the pulmonary parenchyma or chest wall with pleural effusions is also a possibility.
- Neuromuscular weakness could contribute to the tachypnea as well.
- Incentive spirometry, oxygen therapy, and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) will be attempted to recruit lung volumes.
- If there is persistent compromise despite these measures, progressive restriction and parenchymal involvement may be considered with repeat CT.

2. Leptomeningeal Process:
- Follow-up cultures and testing will be done to evaluate the leptomeningeal process.
- Repeat LP (lumbar puncture) has been reassuring so far.
- Further follow-up evaluation is needed.

3. LFT Abnormalities:

   48F with confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities, as
   of yet unexplained: hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss,
   altered mental status,  elevated LFTs, thrombocytopenia, mediastinal
   LAD, leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal CSF.
   # Pulm: Unclear etiology.  Pt presented initially with tachypnea,
   hypoxia.  Has been persistently tachypneic/tachycardic in ICU.  Overall
   02 requirement has somewhat decreased, however pt desaturates to 70%s
   when off 02.  Low lung volumes on CXR with ? effusions.  Had been
   concerned about CHF, however EF WNL and by urine lytes was
   intravascularly dry, now s/p rescusitation.   Unclear etiology.  Did
   not tolerate IPPV yesterday, though did have small improvement in O2
   sats at the time.
   - Aggressive efforts to improve low lung volumes wit OOB, IS and
   intermittent PPV
   - ? neuromuscular etiology for poor respiratory effort and rapid
   shallow breathing, NIF checked, low at -24cm H2O though unclear if poor
   patient effort.
   - Can consider spirometry sitting up and laying flat to determine
   differential.  If large decrease when laying flat, may be
   diaphragm/neuromuscular etiology.  Could consider EMG/nerve conduction
   studies at that time.  Will discuss with RT on Monday (ie portable
   spirometry vs. PFT lab).
   - Can still consider bronch to tissue sample of mediastinal/subcarinal
   LAD, will hold off for now.
   - PPD negative
   - After discussing with cards, felt that late bubbles on ECHO are
   consistent with pulm AVMs, recommend repeat TTE when HR controlled to
   reevaluate valves and EF.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis did not reveal any lymphadenopathy, but did show
   ascites.  It is possible that she is third spacing fluid into her
   lungs, but is intra-vascular volume deplete, ID today added
   consideration for pulmonary leak syndrome/? HANTA virus

   neoplastic or related to systemic illness (SLE, sarcoid, Behcet
   Sjogren
s, RA).  Malignancy less likely given results of CSF flow
   cytometry (reactive lymphocytes, no malignant cells).
   - Follow up viral cultures and other CSF studies
   - Continue doxycycline for leptospirosis coverage until leptospira ab
   negative

   - Per ID, will send urine histoplasma Ag.  No obvious source at this
   time.
   - Continue to CIS, trend fever curve.
   #LFT abnormalities:  Improving; still no clear etiology.
   - Hepatology input appreciated, covering with doxycycline empirically

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities, including hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAD), leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The differential diagnosis includes viral, TB, fungal, spirochete, neoplastic, or related to systemic illness such as SLE, sarcoid, Behcet's, Sjogren's, or RA. Malignancy is less likely given the results of CSF flow cytometry (reactive lymphocytes, no malignant cells).

The patient's pulmonary condition is also unclear etiology. She presented initially with tachypnea and hypoxia and has been persistently tachypneic/tachycardic in the ICU. The oxygen requirement has somewhat decreased, but the patient desaturates to 70% when off oxygen. Low lung volumes on chest X-ray with pleural effusions were observed. There were concerns about congestive heart failure, but the ejection fraction was normal and the urine electrolytes showed intravascular volume depletion, now post-resuscitation.

The patient did not tolerate invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) yesterday, although there was a small improvement in oxygen saturation at"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a confusing constellation of symptoms and lab abnormalities. The symptoms include hypoxia and tachypnea, tachycardia, hearing loss, altered mental status, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), thrombocytopenia, mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAD), and leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on supplemental oxygen, doxycycline for leptospirosis coverage, and other medications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 125/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, but anxious and depressed in affect.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, platelet count of 88,000/mm³, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and liver enzymes (ALT and AST) elevated at 185 and 95 U/L, respectively. The albumin level is 2.1 g/dL, and the total bilirubin level is 2.9 mg/dL. Other lab results, including electrolytes,"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with multiple complaints and with slow to improve
   oxygenation but with capacity to wean supplemental oxygen.
   1)Hypoxemia-
   -Patient with wean of o2 as tolerated and will trial room air
   -Patient with NIF -25 but complicated by patient effort
   -Will pursue upright and supine spirometry to look for 15% fall in
   supine position to consider possible diaphram weakness
   -If found would consider a progressive inflammatory demyelinating
   disorder as possible explanation and with neurology could consider
   EMG/NCS studies to better define.
   -Today--OOB to chair, incentive spirometry and re-evaluation CXR in am.
   2)MRI Abnormalities-
   -Flow reassuring for absence of malignancy
   3)Leukocytosis-
   -Doxycycline continuing
   -No new findings on culture results
   -Will continue to adjust with ID input
   4)Transaminitis-
   -Improving
   -Ceruloplasmin normal
   5)Hyponatremia-
   -Improving with free water restriction and adequate volume status
   6)Thrombocytopenia-
   -Resolved without intervention
   7)Nutrition-
   -Will need to enhance po intake and TPN used intermittently

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with multiple complaints. She has been slow to improve in oxygenation but has shown capacity to wean supplemental oxygen. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygenation is still slow to improve, and there is a consideration for diaphragmatic weakness. If this is confirmed, it could indicate a possible inflammatory demyelinating disorder.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an infection or inflammation. Doxycycline has been prescribed, and the patient's culture results are being monitored.

3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting liver dysfunction. However, it is improving, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which are improving with free water restriction and adequate volume status.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient initially had a low platelet count, but it has resolved without intervention.

6. Nutrition: The patient's nutritional needs should be addressed, including enhancing oral intake and using total parenteral nutrition (TPN) intermittently.

7. MRI abnormalities: The patient's MRI results show reassuring findings without malignancy.

8. Cardiovascular issues: The patient is experiencing tachycardia and tachypnea"
