   This is a 51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and
   restrictive disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generelly due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - repeat ABG after trach respositioning, goal PCO2 70s-80s
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below
   - Call IP for new custom made trach to avoid future movement of trach.
   # Hypotension: hypotensive on presentation, unclear etiology. Likely
   hypovolemia vs infection.  Known pseudomonas PNA.  Currently
   normotensive, off pressors since [**9-13**] midnight.
   - hold pressors unless MAPs <55.
   - continue fluid boluses prn
   - continue empiric vancomycin dosed by level, tobra dosed by level,
   hold off on colistin.
   - serial HCTs
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx, urine cx
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: The patient recently grew
   resistant pseudomonas on his sputum which persisted on repeat cx [**2178-9-9**]
   sensitive to tobramycin and gent only. Colistin sent to outside lab but
   sensis not available in our system. He is currently on tobramycin day
   [**10-19**]. Was planning on completion of course [**2178-9-18**].
   - check tobra level, received 120mg IV dose in ED
   - not giving colistin now.  If febrile again, c/s ID and discuss adding
   colistin.
   # Elevated INR: INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before. Unclear
   etiology of rapid elevation, has been on7.5mg daily dosing which was
   relatively stable dose last several days. [**Month (only) 11**] be elevated if drawn off
   line or with recent abx, nutritional deficiency. HCT and PLT stable
   with no e/o active bleed.  Rechecks of INR consistently high.  Given
   Vit K 2mg NG and INR came down 1 point.
   - Vitamin K 5mg ng this AM
   - repeat INR in PM
   - if remains elevated [**6-13**] with no active bleeding will hold coumadin,
   and give PO vitamin K given has had recent bleed
   - if develops active bleed, IV vitamin K
   -restart coumadin once INR <3.
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - repeat UA and cx
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved from nadir of 90s. Unclear etiology last
   admission.
   - continue to trend
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
   # Anemia: HCT stable since discharge around new baseline 28. Last
   transfused [**2178-8-31**] for history of GIB, bleeding from trach site, and
   psoas bleed found on CT as well as likely component of AOCD and renal
   insufficiency. Coumadin restarted prior to discharge and heparin d/c'd.
   - continue to trend
   - maintain active type and screen, IV access.
   # H/O DVT: BLE U/S most recently did not show DVT. Restarted warfarin
   [**9-5**].
   - holding coumadin now given supratherapeutic INR, monitor coags

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient is now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and an elevated INR.
- The patient's respiratory failure is generally due to obstructive and restrictive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and acute decompensation.
- The patient's hypotension may be caused by hypovolemia or infection, and there is a known pseudomonas pneumonia.
- The patient has chronic renal failure and requires ongoing monitoring.
- The patient's INR is elevated, and the cause is unclear. Vitamin K has been given, and the INR has come down by one point.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if not adequately managed. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters, along with repeated arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, will be necessary to optimize respiratory support.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could indicate hypovolemia or infection. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is essential to prevent further drops in blood pressure"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF).
- On reevaluation, the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure has improved significantly after repositioning of the tracheostomy tube with bronchoscopy. ABG and patient comfort have also improved.
- The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology, likely due to hypovolemia versus infection. He is currently normotensive and off pressors since September 13th midnight.
- The patient has resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP, previously sensitive to tobramycin and gentamicin only. Colistin sensitivity is not available in our system, so it is being held for now.
- The patient has an elevated INR of 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before, with unclear etiology. He has been on a stable dose of warfarin for atrial fibrillation. Vitamin K has been given, and INR has come down by 1 point. Further monitoring and management are required.
- The patient is at risk of constipation, and his home bowel regimen should be continued.
- Funguria has been treated with fluconazole for 14 days, completed on September 11th.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - Thoracic to evaluate for new trach today.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below.
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - transfuse 1 U PRBC
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - maintain IV access
   - consider repeat CT if not improving
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD per tobra level.
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - resume coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**]
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
   # Nails:
   - podiatry consult

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - Thoracic to evaluate for new trach today.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below.
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - transfuse 1 U PRBC
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - maintain IV access
   - consider repeat CT if not improving
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD per tobra level.
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - resume coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**]
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra.
   - Pressure support, ABG after
   .
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - Stopped coumadin
 not tolerating anticoagulation
   - PO vit K 10mg
   - maintain IV access
   - CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   .
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 5 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - d/c coumadin for active bleeding
   .
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   .
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate.
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
 No HD at this time, continue to monitor with
   increasing Tobra dose

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease. He was recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute respiratory failure (ARF). The patient is now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 100/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is responsive to sound but not following simple commands. Coarse breath sounds are heard bilaterally, along with upper airway noise. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 24.9 g/dL, platelet count of 108 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL, and an elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and sputum culture shows moderate growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypercarbic respiratory failure, a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) levels,"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra 4 more days QOD dosing
   - trial pressure support, ABG after
   .
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - No evidence of new bleed
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, transfuse for under 25
   - Stopped coumadin
 not tolerating anticoagulation
   - Given IV vitK for elevated INR
   - maintain IV access
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit
   - Starting D5W with K at 150ml/hour, increase as needed on repete lytes
   - Check PM lytes - give more D5W if needed
   - Watch glucose levels closely
   .
   # Tube feeds:
   - Restart slowly, check residuals
   - CXR
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   .
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 4 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - d/c coumadin for active bleeding
   - Check PM coags
   .
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate.
   - d/c anticoag due to bleed
   .
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   - Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
 No HD at this time, continue to monitor with
   increasing Tobra dose
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). He is currently readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. The patient has multiple medical complications including pain control, chronic respiratory failure, VAP, anemia secondary to blood loss, hypernatremia, chronic renal failure, hypotension, funguria, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and nail issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to obstructive and restrictive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation, and recent decompensation. Monitoring ABG values, maintaining on AC with ARDSnet Vt, and continuing home medications will be important for managing this condition.
2. VAP: The patient has resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP. Tobramycin has been initiated, and the dose needs to be increased to 150 mg QOD. It is crucial to check the peak level 1 hour after tobra administration and continue treatment for 4 more days.
3. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Trending Hct levels, transfusing when below 25, maintaining IV access, stopping Coumadin, and initiating SQ heparin for prophylaxis are necessary"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   #patient continued to require boluses of fentanyl.  Methadone increased
   to 10mg TID and dilaudid ordered to replace fentanyl boluses.  Ativan
   as prn anxiolytic.
   -follow dilaudid  requirement, increase methadone if regularly
   requiring dilaudid
   -continue ativan anxiolytic
L KNEE PAIN
   #New left knee pain noted today.  Pain with palpation, no obvious
   temperature difference, erythema or swelling.  Possible
   fracture/ligamentous injury vs gout vs septic arthritis vs DVT.  Pain
   in the region of previous DVT.
   - LENIs to eval for DVT
   - If LENIs negative tap knee for fluid analysis
   - if gout give steroids
   - if inf start abx
   - if all studies negative, order brace for patient transport for
   comfort
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra 4 more days QOD dosing
   - trial pressure support, ABG after
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 4 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   # Hct drop:  Hct from 25.2 to 23.4 today.   Was on coumadin for
   paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before
   likely from fluconazole/warfarin interaction.  Now resolved after
   Vitamin K. Most likely source is known RP hematoma in setting of
   elevated INR.  INR currently improved at 1.8.
   - trend Hct Q12hrs, transfuse for under 25
   - Stopped coumadin, started SC Heparin
   - maintain IV access
   - Check PM coags
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   - Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
 No HD at this time, continue to monitor with
   increasing Tobra dose
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
   # Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit yesterday.  Received D5W and
   repleted K as needed.
   - Continue  D5W 200ml/hour, repete lytes as needed
   - Check PM lytes - give more D5W if needed
   - Watch glucose levels closely
ALTERED NUTRITION
   # Tube feeds: Restarted yseterday after TF coming out from around trach
   site.
   - Back at goals
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
 Fungal UTI
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute renal failure (ARF), and readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. The patient has multiple medical complications, including pain control, left knee pain, chronic respiratory failure, VAP, anemia secondary to blood loss, chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, altered nutrition, hypotension, fungal urinary tract infection (UTI), impaired skin integrity, and impaired glycemic control.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:

1. Pain control: The patient requires continuous pain management due to acute and chronic pain issues. Inadequate pain control can lead to increased patient distress and discomfort.

2. Left knee pain: The patient's new left knee pain may be caused by various factors such as fracture/ligamentous injury, gout, septic arthritis, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If left untreated, it could worsen the patient's discomfort and potentially lead to further complications.

3. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure due to obstructive and restrictive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and a previous episode of acute decompensation. Poor management of this condition can result in worsening respiratory function and potential respiratory arrest.

4. VAP: The patient has resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP, which is a serious infection acquired during mechanical ventilation. If not appropriately treated, it can lead to sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ dysfunction.

5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, likely from a known right lower extremity hematoma. Continued blood loss or inadequate transfusion support can exacerbate anemia and lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.

6. Chronic renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may be due to medications, hypotension, or previous conditions. Poor management of renal function can result in further kidney damage and the need for renal replacement therapy.

7. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is an electrolyte imbalance characterized by high sodium levels. If left untreated, it can lead to severe dehydration, neurological complications, and even death.

8. Altered nutrition: The patient has altered nutrition due to tube feeding issues. Inadequate nutrition can impair wound healing, immune function, and overall recovery.

9. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which was resolved with intravenous fluids. Persistent hypotension can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

10. Fungal UTI: Although the patient completed fluconazole treatment, the presence of funguria suggests a possible fungal urinary tract infection. Inadequate treatment or reinfection can lead to recurrent infections and potential spread to other organs.

11. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity with pressure ulcers. Poor wound care management can result in infection, delayed healing, and increased risk of complications.

12. Glycemic control: The patient requires regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. Inadequate management of blood glucose levels can increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.

In summary, the potential medical complications for this patient include inadequate pain control, worsening left knee pain, chronic respiratory failure exacerbation, resistant VAP, worsening anemia, chronic renal failure progression, hypernatremia, altered nutrition, persistent hypotension, fungal UTI, impaired skin integrity, and inadequate glycemic control."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   #patient continued to require boluses of fentanyl.  Methadone increased
   to 10mg TID and dilaudid ordered to replace fentanyl boluses.  Ativan
   as prn anxiolytic.
   -follow dilaudid  requirement, increase methadone if regularly
   requiring dilaudid
   -continue ativan anxiolytic
L KNEE PAIN
   #New left knee pain noted today.  Pain with palpation, no obvious
   temperature difference, erythema or swelling.  Possible
   fracture/ligamentous injury vs gout vs septic arthritis vs DVT.  Pain
   in the region of previous DVT.
   - LENIs to eval for DVT
   - If LENIs negative tap knee for fluid analysis
   - if gout give steroids
   - if inf start abx
   - if all studies negative, order brace for patient transport for
   comfort
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra 4 more days QOD dosing
   - trial pressure support, ABG after
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 4 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   # Hct drop:  Hct from 25.2 to 23.4 today.   Was on coumadin for
   paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before
   likely from fluconazole/warfarin interaction.  Now resolved after
   Vitamin K. Most likely source is known RP hematoma in setting of
   elevated INR.  INR currently improved at 1.8.
   - trend Hct Q12hrs, transfuse for under 25
   - Stopped coumadin, started SC Heparin
   - maintain IV access
   - Check PM coags
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   - Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
 No HD at this time, continue to monitor with
   increasing Tobra dose
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
   # Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit yesterday.  Received D5W and
   repleted K as needed.
   - Continue  D5W 200ml/hour, repete lytes as needed
   - Check PM lytes - give more D5W if needed
   - Watch glucose levels closely
ALTERED NUTRITION
   # Tube feeds: Restarted yseterday after TF coming out from around trach
   site.
    - Back at goals
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
 Fungal UTI
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   #Tach and sacral decub ulcerations
   -follow wound care recs

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute renal failure (ARF). He is currently readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. The patient requires pain control, and his left knee pain has been noted, with possible fracture/ligamentous injury, gout, septic arthritis, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Imaging and joint aspiration are pending to evaluate these possibilities. The patient also has chronic respiratory failure due to obstructive and restrictive lung disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and acute decompensation that improved significantly after repositioning of the tracheostomy tube with bronchoscopy.

The patient previously had resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP and is currently on tobramycin. He also has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, likely from a known right popliteal hematoma in the setting of elevated INR. The patient's INR has been resolved after receiving vitamin K. He has chronic renal failure, likely acute tubular necrosis and interstitial nephritis from medication and hypotension. Renal has deferred hemodialysis since the patient's kidneys have started to recover. The patient has hypernatremia, which was corrected with D5W and repletion of potassium as needed. He also has altered nutrition"
