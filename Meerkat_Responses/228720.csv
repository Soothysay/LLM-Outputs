   84 yo male with history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure,
   severe PVD POD5 of right axillary bypass, who was transferred to the
   CCU for treatment of wide complex tachycardia.
   .
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia:  As the rate of the tachycardia is regular
   and around 140s, the differential diagnosis includes ventricular
   tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy including
   atrial flutter with aberrancy.  Pt has an ICD which has a fractured
   lead, therefore not functioning.
   - Amiodarone drip at 2mg/[**Last Name (LF) 83**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] decrease today to 1mg/[**First Name3 (LF) 83**] as less
   frequent runs
   - Beta blockers for attempt at rate control
   - Replace electrolytes for goal K 4 and Mag 2
   - If patient becomes unstable will attempt cardioversion
   - Will hold meds which could possibly drop blood pressure including
   tamsulosin and lasix for now.
   - Touch base with EP in AM regarding repair of AICD as has been planned
   in the past admissions

   # Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  TTE on this admission shows EF of
   20-25% with grade 2 diastolic dysfunction.  Pt is currently euvolemic,
   withour respiratory decompensation or worsening LE edema
   - Hold standing lasix given possibility of decompensation and use PRN
   lasix for volume overload
   -Continue home beta blocker dose
   - Continue digoxin
   .
   # PVD/Dry gangrene of LLE:  Vascular on board.  Plan was for possible
   surgery in the future.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and bypass surgery. He was admitted to the CCU for wide complex tachycardia. The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with a fractured lead, which is not functioning properly. He is currently on amiodarone drip for rate control and beta blockers for further rate control. Electrolyte levels are being monitored and maintained at goal levels. If the patient becomes unstable, cardioversion will be attempted. Medications that could potentially lower blood pressure, such as tamsulosin and Lasix, have been held.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient's regular rate of around 140 beats per minute is consistent with ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. Amiodarone drip has been initiated at 2mg/hr, and the dose has been decreased to 1mg/hr as the frequency of tachycardia runs has decreased. Beta blockers will be used for rate control, and electrolyte levels will be maintained at goal levels. Cardioversion will be considered if the patient becomes unstable.

2. CAD: The patient has a history of anterior myocardial infarction leading to ischemic cardiomyopathy. Aspirin and statin therapy will continue"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a fractured lead in his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). 

The patient was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for treatment of wide complex tachycardia. The differential diagnosis for the wide complex tachycardia includes ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy, including atrial flutter with aberrancy. 

The patient is currently being treated with an amiodarone drip at 2mg/hr, which was decreased to 1mg/hr due to less frequent runs of tachycardia. Beta blockers are being used for rate control. Electrolytes are being monitored and replaced as needed to maintain goal levels of potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++). Cardioversion will be attempted if the patient becomes unstable.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) following an anterior myocardial infarction (MI), resulting in ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient is euvolemic without respiratory decompensation or worsening lower extremity edema. Lasix is being held due to the possibility of decompensation, but will be used PRN for volume overload. The patient's home beta blocker dose is being continued, along with digoxin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure, and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who was admitted to the CCU for treatment of wide complex tachycardia. The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with a fractured lead, rendering it non-functional. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, metoprolol, furosemide, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wide Complex Tachycardia: The patient's regular wide complex tachycardia may be ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. The ICD fracture hinders effective treatment, and the patient is at risk of unstable rhythms leading to hemodynamic compromise.
2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has an ejection fraction of 20-25% with grade 2 diastolic dysfunction. There is a risk of decompensation due to fluid overload or medication adjustments.
3. PVD/Dry Gangrene of LLE: The patient has severe PVD with dry gangrene on the left lower extremity. Surgical intervention may be required, but there is a risk of infection due to compromised blood flow.
4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, and renal dos"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent anterior myocardial infarction (MI). He was admitted to the CCU for treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with a fractured lead, so it is not functioning. He has been diagnosed with chronic systolic heart failure and an estimated ejection fraction of 20-25%. The patient also has chronic renal insufficiency and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's current condition includes large eschar on the left posterior calf, left foot, and sacral area. He has been receiving prophylactic antibiotics due to the eschars. There is concern for potential malignancy in the chest causing compression, possibly a Pancoast tumor. The patient has been on a heart-healthy diet and his blood glucose levels have been controlled. He is on multiple medications including aspirin, a statin, metoprolol, digoxin, tamsulosin, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presence of eschars raises concerns for potential infection, especially since he is receiving prophylactic antibiotics. Close monitoring for signs of infection is crucial.
2. Malignancy: There is a possibility of malignancy causing compression in the chest, potentially a Panco"

   84 yo male with history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure,
   severe PVD POD5 of right axillary bypass, who was transferred to the
   CCU for treatment of wide complex tachycardia.
   # Wide Complex Tachycardia:  As the rate of the tachycardia is regular
   and around 140s, the differential diagnosis includes ventricular
   tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy including
   atrial flutter with aberrancy.  Pt has an ICD which has a fractured
   lead, therefore not functioning.
   - Amiodarone drip at 2mg/[**Last Name (LF) 83**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] decrease today to 1mg/[**First Name3 (LF) 83**] as less
   frequent runs
   - Beta blockers for attempt at rate control
   - Replace electrolytes for goal K 4 and Mag 2
   - If patient becomes unstable will attempt cardioversion
   -  Will hold meds which could possibly drop blood pressure including
   tamsulosin and lasix for now.
   - Touch base with EP in AM regarding repair of AICD as has been planned
   in the past admissions
   # CAD:  S/P anterior MI resulting in ischemic cardiomyopathy based on
   prior notes although no cardiac catheterization or ETT in the system.
   - Continue aspirin
   - Continue statin
   # Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  TTE on this admission shows EF of
   20-25% with grade 2 diastolic dysfunction.  Pt is currently euvolemic,
   withour respiratory decompensation or worsening LE edema
   - Hold standing lasix given possibility of decompensation and use PRN

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure, and severe peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted to the CCU for treatment of wide complex tachycardia. The patient has an ICD with a fractured lead, which is not functioning properly. He is currently on amiodarone drip and beta blockers for rate control. Electrolyte replacement is being administered to achieve target levels. Cardioversion will be attempted if the patient becomes unstable. Medications that could potentially lower blood pressure, such as tamsulosin and lasix, are being held. 

The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-25% and grade 2 diastolic dysfunction. He is euvolemic without respiratory decompensation or worsening lower extremity edema. Lasix is being held and will be used as needed for volume overload. The patient's current medications for heart failure include a home beta blocker and digoxin.

Additionally, the patient has peripheral vascular disease and dry gangrene of the left lower extremity. Vascular recommendations are being followed, and regular wound care is being provided. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are also being administered.

Other medical conditions include benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hyperlipidemia, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient is on a heart-healthy diet, and glycemic control is being monitored. The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous anterior myocardial infarction (MI). He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with a fractured lead, which is not functioning. He is currently on amiodarone and metoprolol for his cardiac conditions.

The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25% and grade 2 diastolic dysfunction. He is euvolemic without respiratory decompensation or worsening lower extremity edema. His medications include aspirin, a statin, beta blockers, and digoxin.

Additionally, the patient has PVD with dry gangrene of the left lower extremity (LLE) and is being followed by vascular medicine. He is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics until he can be seen as an outpatient for possible surgery. Pain control is managed with Percocet elixir.

Furthermore, the patient has right upper extremity (RUE) swelling, and a CT of the chest is pending to evaluate for a possible history of malignancy causing compression.

Other medical issues include benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hyperlipidemia, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently awaiting disposition to the medicine floor."

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a previous anterior myocardial infarction (MI) resulting in ischemic cardiomyopathy. The patient was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT). He has an implanted cardiac defibrillator (ICD) with a fractured lead, rendering it non-functional. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, metoprolol, aspirin, statin, digoxin, and tamsulosin.

The patient's recent medical issues include dry gangrene of the left lower extremity (LLE), right upper extremity (RUE) swelling, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 90/46 mmHg and heart rate of 71 bpm. The patient is currently euvolemic and without respiratory decompensation or worsening LLE edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation, previous MI, and VT increases the risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or recurrent VT.

2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his compromised immune system"

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) postoperative right axillary bypass, who was transferred to the CCU for treatment of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with a fractured lead, rendering it nonfunctional but increasing the risk of infection. The patient is currently being treated with amiodarone, metoprolol, and replacement of electrolytes for goal potassium (K) 4 and magnesium (Mg) 2.

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) postanterior myocardial infarction (MI) resulting in ischemic cardiomyopathy. He is being managed with aspirin and statin therapy.

Additionally, the patient has chronic systolic heart failure, with an estimated ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25% and grade 2 diastolic dysfunction. He is currently euvolemic without respiratory decompensation or worsening lower extremity edema. Lasix is held on a standing basis due to the possibility of decompensation, but can be used as needed for volume overload. The patient continues his home beta-blocker dose and digoxin therapy.

Furthermore, the patient presents with PVD and dry gangrene of the left lower extremity. Vascular consultation is pending, with plans for possible future surgery"

   # Wide Complex Tachycardia:  As the rate of the tachycardia is regular
   and around 140s, the differential diagnosis includes ventricular
   tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy including
   atrial flutter with aberrancy.  Pt has an ICD which has a fractured
   lead, therefore not functioning.

   - Replace electrolytes for goal K 4 and Mag 2
   - If patient becomes unstable will attempt cardioversion
   -  Will hold meds which could possibly drop blood pressure including
   tamsulosin and lasix for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, systolic heart failure, and severe peripheral vascular disease. He was transferred to the CCU for treatment of wide complex tachycardia. The patient has an ICD with a fractured lead, making it non-functional. He is currently on amiodarone drip for rate control and beta-blockers for further rate control. Electrolytes are being replaced to achieve goal levels of potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++). Cardioversion will be attempted if the patient becomes unstable. Medications that could potentially drop blood pressure, such as tamsulosin and lasix, have been withheld. The patient's previous medical history includes chronic systolic heart failure, anterior myocardial infarction resulting in ischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic renal insufficiency, hyperlipidemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient is euvolemic without respiratory decompensation or worsening lower extremity edema. The plan is to continue aspirin and statin therapy, hold standing lasix, and continue home beta-blocker and digoxin doses. The patient also has dry gangrene of the left lower extremity and vascular recommendations are being followed. Regular wound care and broad-spectrum antibiotics are also prescribed. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure"
