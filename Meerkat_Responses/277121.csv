   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen).
   Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT chest, and EKG.
   Tropononin wnl but BNP is markedly elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding
   due to crohn's disease, concern for use of TPA would be GI bleed and
   intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH.
   - heparin drip with bolus
   - mechanical ventilation; will ultimately try to wean FIO2 if possible
   - minimize PEEP to limit dead space ventillation
   - type and cross 4 units of PRBCs
   - ensure stable access in anticipation of possible lysis
   - TPA 100 mg over 2 hours if hypotensive or worsening respiratory
   status
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and HISS.
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - RISS and glargine
   - consider insulin drip if significant hyperglycemia and there is
   enough access for it
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and possible TPA
   .
   Hyperkalemia.  Likely due to acidosis and renal failure.
   - insulin/d50
   - sodium bicarb
   - IVFs
   - serial Lytes
   - Kayexelate
   .
   HTN.
   - hold antihypertensives
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with diabetes, hypertension, and Crohn's disease. He was admitted with a submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has a massive clot burden, significant hypoxia, and evidence of right heart strain on imaging studies. Due to his recent gastrointestinal bleeding, there is concern about using tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for lysis. The patient is currently on a heparin drip, mechanical ventilation, and receiving IV fluids. He also has type 2 diabetes and is receiving steroids, which may cause significant hyperglycemia. The patient has a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease and was observed for a GI bleed. He is on a prednisone taper but had to increase the dose due to worsening symptoms. The patient's potassium levels are elevated, and his renal function is within normal limits. He has leukocytosis, likely related to chronic steroid use. The patient's medical history includes hypertension and Crohn's disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's current condition of submassive PE can lead to further complications such as massive PE, pulmonary hypertension, right heart strain, and potentially death if not managed appropriately.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires close monitoring and management, including weaning off mechanical ventilation and minimizing dead space ventilation.
3. Gastrointestinal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with diabetes, hypertension, and Crohn's disease. He was admitted with a submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient had a massive clot burden on CT angiography with significant hypoxia. He also showed evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT chest, and EKG. Troponin levels were mildly elevated, and BNP was markedly elevated. Given the recent gastrointestinal bleeding due to Crohn's disease, there was concern about the use of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleed and intracranial hemorrhage. The patient received a 140 mg subcutaneous injection of lovenox at the other hospital and underwent lysis with significant improvement in respiratory status.

Medical Complications:
1. Submassive Pulmonary Embolism: The patient presented with a submassive PE and required urgent intervention.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure.
3. Right Heart Strain: The patient showed evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT chest, and EKG, indicating potential strain on the right side of the heart.
4. Troponin Elevation: The patient had mildly elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial injury.
5. BNP Markedly Elevated: The patient had a markedly elevated brain natri"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease who presented with several days of shortness of breath and was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient underwent lysis for the PE and showed improvement in hemodynamics and gas exchange. However, he remains sedated and unable to provide history.

24-hour events:
- The patient lysed overnight due to high minute ventilation and lower blood pressures despite fluid resuscitation.
- There was improvement in gas exchange after lysis.
- The patient's heart rate and blood pressure improved after lysis.
- The patient developed a fever overnight.
- The patient had melena this morning.

Medical history:
The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, diabetes mellitus, and allergies to metformin and azithromycin. He is currently on several medications including heparin, propofol, pantoprazole, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), hydrocortisone, risperidone (Riss), and mesalamine.

Physical examination:
The patient appears overweight/obese, with PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), endotracheal tube, OG tube in place, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, warm skin, and absent radial and dorsalis pulses on the right side.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient has massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  Given recent GI bleeding due to crohn's disease, concern for
   use of TPA would be GI bleed and intracranial hemorrhage.  Patient is
   s/p 140 mg SC of lovenox at OSH and now s/p lysis with marked
   improvement of respiratory status.
   - heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - PS support trial with plan to extubate later today
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   - type and cross 6 units of PRBCs
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection
   in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - q 4-6 hour hcts
   .
   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Likely related to chronic steroid use.  No clear sign of
   infection.
   - monitor wbc, fever curve

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old male with diabetes, hypertension, and Crohn's disease.
- He was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation.
- The patient has a massive clot burden on computed tomography angiography (CTA), significant hypoxia, right heart strain on echocardiogram (echo), CT chest, and electrocardiogram (EKG).
- Troponin levels are mildly elevated, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is markedly elevated.
- The patient recently experienced gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to Crohn's disease, so thrombolytic therapy was not considered.
- The patient received 140 mg of subcutaneous (SC) lovenox at the outside hospital and underwent lysis with marked improvement in respiratory status.
- The patient is currently on heparin drip with a goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-100, PS support trial with plans to extubate later today, IV fluid boluses for low central venous pressure (CVP), and type and cross 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
- The patient has type 2 diabetes and is on glargine insulin. With steroid use, his blood glucose levels are likely to become significantly elevated.
- The patient has a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease, with significant colonic inflammation"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with submassive PE and
   respiratory failure requring intubation.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient had massive clot burden on CTA with
   significant hypoxia (PAO2 is only 130s in spite of 100% oxygen) upon
   presentation.  Patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT
   chest, and EKG.  Tropononin mildly elevated and BNP is markedly
   elevated.  s/p lysis.  Now extubated and much improved.
   - cont heparin gtt for now
   - do not start coumadin for now until GI issues resolved
   - LENIs to evaluate if large clot burden remains (in case
   anticoagulation needs to be stopped emergently in a setting of a GI
   bleed in the future)
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient has recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease.  Most recent
   colonoscopy in [**5-2**] showed significant colonic inflammation.  He was
   observed in the MICU for GI bleed, but did not requiring blood
   transfusiosn.  He was put on prednisone taper at discharge.  Recently
   had worsening of symptoms with steroid taper so had to go up on
   prednisone dose from 15 to 17 last week.  Now with marroon colored
   stool in setting of s/p lysis and being on heparin drip.
   - stress dose steroids given that patient is on chronic steroids and is
   now critically ill; additionally, this might offer colonic protection

   .
   Hypotension.  Likely related to massive PE.  Low CVPs suggest
   hypovelmia as well.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - IVF boluses for low CVP
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 56-year-old male with diabetes, hypertension, and Crohn's disease who was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT chest, and EKG. He underwent lysis and is now extubated and much improved.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient had a massive PE with significant hypoxia, which may lead to further pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has evidence of right heart strain, indicating possible right ventricular dysfunction or failure. This can lead to further cardiovascular complications like cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.

3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease and is experiencing maroon-colored stools, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding. With the patient's use of anticoagulation therapy (heparin drip), there is an increased risk of bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's recent creatinine levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, indicating possible renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, likely related to chronic steroid use. While there are no clear signs of infection"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 56-year-old male with diabetes, hypertension, and Crohn's disease who was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation.
- The patient had a massive clot burden on CT angiography, significant hypoxia, and evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT chest, and EKG. Troponin levels were mildly elevated, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was markedly elevated.
- The patient underwent lysis and was extubated. He is currently on heparin drip and has improved.
- The patient has type 2 diabetes and is on glargine insulin. Steroid use may cause significant hyperglycemia, so long-acting insulin may be considered if the patient improves.
- The patient has a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease and has been observed for a GI bleed. He is on a prednisone taper, but symptoms have worsened, leading to an increase in the dose from 15 to 17 last week. He is now experiencing maroon-colored stool while on heparin drip.
- Stress dose steroids have been given due to chronic steroid use and critical illness. This may also provide colonic protection in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tissue plasminogen activator (TPA).
- The patient is hypotensive, likely related to massive PE. Low central venous pressure (CVP) suggests hypovolemia as well.
- Renal failure is present, with creatinine levels ranging from 1.3 to 2.0. Medications will be dosed based on renal function, and creatinine levels will be monitored.
- Leukocytosis is likely related to chronic steroid use. There are no clear signs of infection.
- The patient has a right internal jugular (IJ) line, one peripheral line, and a right radial arterial line (A-line).
- The patient's code status is full code, confirmed with a healthcare proxy and wife. The contact person is the wife, who can be reached at [telephone/fax number].

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. GI bleed: The patient has maroon-colored stool while on heparin drip, which raises concerns about the possibility of a GI bleed, especially considering his recent worsening symptoms of Crohn's disease.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely due to massive PE. This may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction if not properly managed.

3. Renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate medication dosing will be necessary to prevent further deterioration.

4. Infection: Although there are no"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease who presented with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and underwent lysis. The patient was extubated and is doing well, but there are concerns about slow gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with stable hemoglobin levels. The patient has been on continuous heparin infusion and will continue to be monitored for any potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient initially presented with a massive PE, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has slow GIB, which can be caused by various factors such as medication use, underlying Crohn's disease, or anticoagulation therapy. GIB can lead to hypotension, shock, and anemia if not managed properly.
3. Anticoagulation Therapy: The patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin. There is a risk of bleeding complications, including GIB, hematoma formation, or hemorrhagic stroke. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and close observation for signs of bleeding are necessary.
4. Crohn's Disease Flare-up: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, and the current presentation may be associated with an active flare-up of the disease. Management of inflammation and control of Crohn"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease who presents with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient underwent lytic therapy and was subsequently extubated.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated blood pressure, normal heart rate, respiratory rate within normal limits, and a temperature within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is at 90%. The patient is on systemic anticoagulation with heparin.

The patient has ongoing bloody stools, but hemoglobin concentration is stable. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there is a slight increase in creatinine levels. Troponin-T is within normal limits, indicating no cardiac involvement. Imaging shows that the chest X-ray bases are not visualized, and sputum culture is pending.

The patient's plan includes continuing with heparin anticoagulation, holding off on coumadin for now, checking Leningen levels, and discussing the optimal Crohn's regimen in the setting of necessary anticoagulation. The patient is also being started on prednisone and mesalamine for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) likely secondary to Crohn's disease.

In terms of ICU care, the patient will continue with regular diet, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and will have arterial and central lines placed. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 7589**] is a 56 yo male with diabetes, hypertension, crohn's
   disease, on steroids, who is admitted with massive PE s/p lysis, now
   with ongoing GI bleed presumably from Crohn
s disease.
   .
   Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient had massive clot burden now
   hemodynamically stable post lysis.  Extubated within 24 hours and
   satting well on 4LNC.  LENIS show residual clot burden in RLE>
   - cont heparin gtt for now
   - do not start coumadin for now until GI issues resolved
   .
   Type 2 Diabetes.  Patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and [**Known lastname 5607**].
   Given steroid use, will likely become significantly hyperglycemic.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 5607**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] consider long acting insulin if improved
   .
   Crohns.  Patient with Crohn
s disasese on prednisone 17 at home prior
   to admission.  Having ongoing maroon stools since lysis with slowly
   downtrending hct, though no hemodynamic instability and has not yet
   required transfusions.  EGD showed no upper source of bleed.
   - continue 40 mg of prednisone daily
   - type and crossed for 6 units
   - TID Hcts
   - transfuse to 25
   .
   Renal failure.  Patient's recent Cr in our system have ranged from 1.3
   to 2.0 so current value is within his range of normal.
   - renally dose all meds
   - follow Cr, trending down

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and Crohn's disease, who was admitted with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) that occurred after lysis. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, extubated, and oxygenating well on 4 liters of nasal cannula. However, the patient has ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, presumed to be from Crohn's disease. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been slowly downtrending, but he is not yet requiring transfusions. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed no upper source of bleeding.

The patient's lower extremities show evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), as indicated by a positive Lower Extremity Venous Ultrasound (LENS). The patient is currently receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin, and it has been decided to temporarily halt the initiation of warfarin until the GI issues are resolved.

The patient also has a history of type 2 diabetes, for which he is on glargine and another type of insulin. Due to the use of steroids, the patient is likely to become significantly hyperglycemic. It is suggested to consider long-acting insulin if the patient's condition improves.

The patient's renal function appears to be within normal limits, with creatinine levels ranging from 1.3 to 2.0. Medications will be dosed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and Crohn's disease. He was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has evidence of right heart strain on echo, CT chest, and EKG. Troponin levels are mildly elevated, and BNP is markedly elevated. The patient underwent lysis and is now extubated and much improved.

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a massive PE with significant hypoxia and evidence of right heart strain. He has been treated with lysis and continues to receive heparin gtt for anticoagulation.
2. Crohn's Disease: The patient has a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease and has been observed in the MICU for a GI bleed. He is on a prednisone taper and is experiencing worsening symptoms with steroid taper.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low CVPs suggest hypovolemia, likely related to massive PE. He is being managed with IVF boluses for low CVP and antihypertensives are being held.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's recent creatinine levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, with the current value within his normal range. His medications are being renally dosed, and his creatinine is trending down.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis likely related to chronic steroid use. No clear signs of infection are present.
6. Stress Dose Steroids: The patient is receiving stress dose steroids due to chronic steroid use and critical illness. This may also offer colonic protection in the setting of heparin bolus/drip and s/p tpa.
7. Maroon Bowel Movements: The patient continues to have maroon-colored stools, which could be indicative of GI bleeding, especially in the context of heparin therapy and s/p lysis.
8. Type 2 Diabetes: The patient is a type two diabetic on glargine and another medication. He is expected to become significantly hyperglycemic due to steroid use. Long-acting insulin may be considered if the patient improves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient's maroon-colored stools indicate ongoing GI bleeding. This could worsen if anticoagulation is not managed properly.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of non-occlusive thrombosis of the right popliteal vein. There is a risk of developing further DVTs.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored as his creatinine levels can fluctuate.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis should be monitored, and signs of infection should be closely observed.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes management should include monitoring for hypoglycemia, especially during the stress of critical illness and steroid use.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient's EKG changes suggest right heart strain, which may increase the risk of arrhythmias."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who presented with respiratory failure due to a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient underwent lysis and showed rapid improvement, but now has a slow gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) likely from an inflamed colon. The patient is currently being treated with therapeutic heparin for the PE and is holding off on starting coumadin due to persistent GIB. A filter has also been held off despite a non-occlusive clot.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient initially presented with a massive PE, which is a life-threatening condition caused by blood clots blocking the pulmonary arteries. The patient underwent lysis and showed rapid improvement, but there is a risk of recurrence or complications such as pulmonary hypertension or right heart strain.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient is experiencing a slow GIB, which could be due to the inflamed colon. This can lead to significant blood loss and may require blood transfusions. It is essential to identify the source of the bleed and control it promptly.
3. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Flare-Up: The patient has a history of IBD, and the current symptoms may indicate a flare-up of the disease. This could lead to complications such as intestinal strictures, fistulas, or abscesses if not properly managed.
4. Heparin-Induced Thromb"

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who presented with respiratory failure due to a massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient underwent lysis and showed rapid improvement, but now has a slow gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) likely from an inflamed colon. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/88 mmHg to 169/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems, but the patient is obese with no muscle wasting. Neurological assessment is not complete.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 261 K/uL, platelet count of 240 K/uL, blood glucose level of 203 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.3 mmol/L. Other laboratory values are within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving therapeutic heparin for the PE and is holding off on coumadin due to persistent GIB. A filter has been considered but is being held off due to a non-occlusive clot. The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is believed to be"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and diverticulosis who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure due to a submassive pulmonary embolism. He has been intubated and transferred to the floor last night after lysis of the pulmonary embolism.

The patient is currently experiencing continued maroon stools and a falling hemoglobin count (HCT). He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, likely secondary to TPA lysis, heparin infusion, and/or Crohn's disease. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight and is reportedly asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. GI Bleed: The patient is likely experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be secondary to TPA lysis, heparin infusion, and/or Crohn's disease. The patient has maroon stools since anticoagulation started. He received 4 units of PRBCs overnight and is asymptomatic with stable hemodynamics. A colonoscopy has been recommended for this morning to further evaluate the source of bleeding. Heparin infusion will be turned off for no more than one hour during the procedure. Active transfusion support has been initiated with a type and crossmatch for 6 units of blood products. The patient's hemoglobin levels will be monitored every 4"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of Crohn's disease who presented with dyspnea and was diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) following lysis. The patient is now experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and awaiting further diagnostic procedures.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 124/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications such as morphine sulfate, protonix, prednisone, rissole, colace, lantus, and heparin gtt.

The patient's review of systems shows no fatigue, fever, weight loss, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, constipation, or brady/taurine. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth), has a cough, and has a Foley catheter in place.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance with total in of 4,592 mL, total out of 4,120 mL, and urine output of 1,720 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with O2 delivery device and SpO2 of 99%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.30.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status.

The patient's lab results show a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 309 K/uL, platelet count of 261 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 30 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 126 mg/dL, and sodium of 141 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable.

The patient's assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleeding, fever of unknown origin, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and acute pulmonary embolism. The plan involves suspecting colon as the source of GIB and performing a colonoscopy. The patient will continue on heparin gtt and awaiting repeat colonoscopy, as well as receiving prednisone and mesalamine. Considering the massive PE and possible inability to tolerate anticoagulation, an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be considered.

The patient's nutritional support is via TPN (total parenteral nutrition), and the patient is on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has two central lines inserted and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is to remain in the ICU until a definitive plan for surgery is determined."

   submassive PE. Transferred to floor yesterday night s/p lysis now with
   continued maroon stools and falling HCT.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Colonoscopy this morning showed active Crohn's disease but no
   evidence of current bleeding.  GI recommended IVC filter and continued
   systemic anticoagulation.
   -Colonoscopy:
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
   Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
   Ulceration and erythema from the transverse colon to cecum compatible
   with Crohn's disease
   Blood clots in the whole colon.  In the terminal ileum, we found normal
   mucosa.  No blood clot and red blood were noticed in the terminal
   ileum.  The stool in the terminal ileum was yellow.  The G.I. bleeding,
   therefore, most likely occurred in the colon.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, Crohn's disease, and previous colectomy. The patient was admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to a submassive pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been experiencing ongoing maroon stools and a falling hematocrit (HCT) since the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) lysis for the PE.

The patient's recent colonoscopy showed active Crohn's disease but no evidence of current bleeding. However, the presence of blood clots in the colon suggests a possible source of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient's EGD did not show any upper GI bleeding. The patient has been started on systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt due to the PE, which may have contributed to the maroon stools and falling HCT.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 140/91 mmHg, heart rate of 69 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's neurologic examination is normal.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 317 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, platelet count of 309 K/uL, and creatinine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and a history of Crohn's disease. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure requiring intubation secondary to a submassive pulmonary embolism. The patient underwent lysis and is now showing signs of continued gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by maroon stools. His hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is falling. A colonoscopy revealed active Crohn's disease but no evidence of current bleeding. It was recommended to place an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter and continue systemic anticoagulation. The patient also has a history of diverticulosis and has undergone two colectomies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's ongoing maroon stools indicate ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be due to the Crohn's flare, anticoagulation therapy, or a combination of both. This is a serious complication that requires close monitoring and potential transfusion.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient initially presented with a submassive pulmonary embolism requiring intubation. Although he has undergone lysis and shows stable hemodynamics, there is still a risk of further embolic events due to his underlying conditions such as Crohn's disease and immobilization.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's recent creatinine levels have ranged from 1.3 to 2.0, indicating possible"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a diagnosis of Crohn's colitis who experienced a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently in the ICU. The patient also has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from active Crohn's disease. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/57mmHg to 157/95mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient has received lysis for the PE and had an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed due to concerns about tolerating anticoagulation. The patient is currently on heparin and will be started on warfarin. 

For the GIB, the patient will continue prednisone and mesalamine and will undergo gastrointestinal follow-up. 

The patient is being managed with regular diet, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the GIB, development of further PEs, or acute renal failure due to the ongoing bleeding and possible hypoperfusion. The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly hyperkalemia, should also be closely monitored. 

Overall, the patient is critically"
