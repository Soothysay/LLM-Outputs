","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with symptoms of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), intermittent chest pain, and palpitations. He was admitted to the emergency department and found to have EKG changes consistent with NSTEMI and elevated troponin levels. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting in the right coronary artery in 2014 and rotational atherectomy (Rotablator) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) in 2019. He was transferred to this hospital for cardiac catheterization, heparin, and integrillin therapy. The patient also has a history of left main lesion occlusion, tight LAD, and probable 70% stenosis in the proximal RCA. He has a family history of myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient's medical history, and current condition, potential medical complications may include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's presentation with NSTEMI, chest pain, and palpitations suggests ongoing ischemia and potential progression to ACS.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure (95/49 mmHg) and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 30 indicate the possibility of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), intermittent chest pain, palpitations, abdominal heaviness, chills, and residual fatigue. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) changes were concerning for NSTEMI, and his troponin I level was elevated at 4. He was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's presentation with NSTEMI and elevated troponin levels suggest ongoing myocardial ischemia, which is a medical emergency. Prompt intervention is required to restore blood flow to the affected coronary artery and prevent further damage to the heart muscle.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's blood pressure is low at 95/49 mmHg, indicating potential cardiogenic shock due to impaired cardiac function. Inadequate cardiac output can lead to organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction.

3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's diabetes mellitus increases the risk of DKA, which is a serious complication characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. Monitoring of blood glucose"

   distal 50-60% stenosis. The LAD had a calcified stenosis in the
   mid-vessel with a 80-90% diagonal branch origin stenosis. The LCX was
   retroflexed and had a proximal 80% stenosis. The RCA was occluded
   proximally, with left-to-right collaterals filling the PDA and PL
   branches.
   2.Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mild systemic arterial
   hypertension as above.
   3. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD
   with a Cypher (2.5x18mm) drug eluting stent postdilated with
   a 3mm balloon. Final angiography demonstrated no angiography apparent
   dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the
   vessel
   (See PTCA comments).
   4. IVUS interrogation of the Left main demonstrated a MCSA of 6.1mm2.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three-vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Systemic arterial hypertension.
   3. Rotational atherectomy and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1891**] in the mid-LAD.

   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
   size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   moderate focal basal to mid inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
   leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with moderate focal basilar and mid inferior and
   inferolateral hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), including intermittent chest pain and palpitations. The patient's EKG changes and elevated troponin levels confirmed the diagnosis of NSTEMI. He was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Medical History:
The patient has a significant medical history of CAD, including previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting in the right coronary artery (RCA) in 2014 and rotablation in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) in 2019. He also had a tight lesion in the circumflex artery (LCX) that was not suitable for intervention. Additionally, the patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Current Medications:
The patient is currently on several medications, including amlodipine, aspirin, Plavix, Divan, metoprolol succinate, fenofibrate, simvastatin, alprazolam, insulin pump, ranitidine, zolpidem, fish oil, B complex, Vit C, Vit E, MVI, saw palmetto, ginkgo biloba, CoQ, and no known drug allergies.

Recent Lab Results:
The patient's recent laboratory results showed elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), cardiac enzymes (CK), troponin I, and C-reactive protein (CRP). The patient's electrolytes were within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has extensive CAD involving multiple vessels, including the RCA, LAD, and LCX. The patient previously underwent PCI with stenting in the RCA and rotablation in the LAD. The LCX lesion was not amenable to intervention.
2. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II: The patient has long-standing DM, which is currently managed with an insulin pump. The patient's glycemic control is unknown.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.9, but it increased to 1.5 at OSH and 1.4 today. The elevated creatinine may be due to poor forward flow in the setting of recent myocardial infarction.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a W"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of a missed event and elevated troponin I level of 4. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient also has a known lesion in the right coronary artery (RCA) that was treated with rotational atherectomy in 2010. He has an 80% lesion in the left circumflex artery (LCX) that was not intervened upon during his last hospital stay.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 38.2°C, heart rate 77 bpm, blood pressure 101/52 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 96% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination: Generalized obesity, oriented x3, neurologically intact, JVP unable to assess due to IABP, PERRLA, clear heart sounds with no murmurs or thrills, lungs clear bilaterally, trace pitting edema in lower extremities, warm and well-perfused, pulses intact.
- Lab results: Hemoglobin 11.9 g/dL, leukocyte count 11.0 K/uL, plate"
