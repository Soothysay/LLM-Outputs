","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient has a history of Librium allergy, which caused hives and swelling. The patient was given diazepam (Valium) at 06:34 AM. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 138/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been monitored closely. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The patient's physical examination reveals general anxiety, diaphoresis, and normal cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Neurological assessment could not be fully conducted due to the patient's tremulousness and uncooperativeness. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and liver enzymes, with normal potassium levels. The patient is on ICU care with nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures in place for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur within 48-96 hours after the last drink. It is characterized by sudden and severe mental or neurological changes, including hallucinations,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including hallucinations. He is currently being treated with Valium for alcohol withdrawal and has received a ""banana bag"" treatment in the emergency department, which includes folate, thiamine, multivitamins, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing delirium likely due to withdrawal and benzodiazepine use. There are concerns about possible Wernicke encephalopathy, but no intoxication by alcohol or other substances. The patient also has mild leukocytosis, likely a stress reaction, and mild acute renal failure, possibly due to dehydration. The patient has a history of Prinzmetal angina, but no ischemic changes are observed on the ECG. The patient denies any suicidal ideation and is currently on citalopram for depression. The patient has an allergy to Librium. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Wernicke encephalopathy: This is a serious condition that can occur in individuals with alcohol abuse and deficiency of thiamine. It is characterized by confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. Immediate administration of thiamine is crucial to prevent further progression of the condition.
2. Delirium tremens: This is a severe form"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including hallucinations and delirium tremens. The patient has been receiving Valium orally every hour as per CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) protocol and has been transitioned to oral folate, thiamine, and multivitamins. Social work consult has been requested. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 138/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 13.0 g/dL, normal glucose level of 100 mg/dL, and mildly elevated creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Delirium Tremens/Alcohol withdrawal/Alcohol abuse: The patient is currently stable, but appears to be experiencing hallucinations. Valium will be continued orally every hour as per CIWA protocol.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely due to alcohol withdrawal and benzodiazep"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presents with alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He is currently experiencing tremors and hallucinations, and his vital signs are stable but can fluctuate. The patient received a banana bag in the emergency department, which included oral folate, thiamine, and multivitamins. He is being treated with continuous intravenous Valium for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Social work consult has been requested, and the plan is to call out once the patient requires benzodiazepines every four hours or less frequently.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium Tremens: The patient is at risk for delirium tremens, a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can include symptoms such as severe agitation, confusion, fever, and hallucinations.
2. Wernicke Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, there is a risk for Wernicke encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia.
3. Infection: The patient has mild leukocytosis, which may indicate a stress reaction or potential infection. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection is important.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has mild acute renal failure likely due to dehydration. Close monitoring of creatinine levels and maintaining adequate fluid intake is essential.
5. Allergic Reaction: Although the patient previously experienced an allergic reaction"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-inch tall, 72.4 kg male with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal. The patient received diazepam at 0800, 1200, and 1600 hours but experienced an accelerating need for the medication along with tachycardia and tremulousness throughout the night. IV diazepam supplementation was initiated to manage symptoms. Potassium levels returned to 2.8 mEq/L, and PM lytes were ordered. The patient has a history of hives and swelling after taking Librium (Oral). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.9 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 116/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are being provided. The patient's weight has decreased from 72.4 kg to 69.7 kg since admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient is at risk for seizures due to alcohol withdrawal. Diazepam supplementation may help in preventing seizures, but continuous monitoring should be maintained.
2. Delirium tremens (DTs): The patient's symptoms of delirium, confusion, and tremulousness indicate a potential risk for developing DTs. Close monitoring for worsening confusion, fever, hypertension, and hallucinations is necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He has been receiving diazepam for symptom management and has shown fluctuating vital signs, including tremors and hallucinations. The patient has been transitioned to oral folate, thiamine, and multivitamins. Social work consult has been requested, and the plan is to call out for benzodiazepines every four hours or less frequently once the patient's vital signs are stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium Tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by sudden and severe mental or neurological changes. It can include symptoms such as confusion, agitation, tremors, hallucinations, and fever. The patient appears to be experiencing hallucinations, which may indicate the early stages of delirium tremens.
2. Wernicke encephalopathy: This is a condition caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1) often seen in alcoholics. Symptoms may include confusion, ataxia (unsteady gait), and ophthalmoplegia (eye movement abnormalities). The patient's recent transition to oral folate, thiamine, and multivitamins suggests an attempt to prevent or treat this condition.
3. Infection: Although the patient's urine analysis and chest X-ray do not currently show signs of infection, monitoring for symptoms of infection is essential due to the patient's weakened"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse presenting with alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient has been receiving diazepam to manage his symptoms, with increasing doses and intervals throughout the night due to an escalating need for the medication. He also received potassium and electrolyte supplementation.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. On physical examination, he appears flushed and diaphoretic, with tongue fasciculations. His neck is supple and there are no signs of infection. His lungs are clear, and his heart sounds are normal. He has a slightly elevated body temperature. The patient is oriented to the hospital but struggles with the date, and he reports hallucinations.

The patient's laboratory results indicate mild leukocytosis, likely a stress reaction. His renal function and electrolyte levels are within normal ranges. His liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are slightly elevated, while his albumin level is normal. His calcium and magnesium levels are also within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes depression, Prinzmetal's angina, and a previous admission for hypotension. He is currently on ASA 325 mg for his cardiovascular condition and holding diltiazem and atenolol.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing with diazepam every hour for CIWA scores greater than 10, with additional IV doses as needed for increased agitation. He should be monitored closely for ongoing benzodiazpine requirements"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presents with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. He is currently experiencing delirium tremens, characterized by increased agitation, hallucinations, tachycardia, and hypertension. The patient has been receiving frequent doses of diazepam to manage his symptoms. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/77 mmHg to 163/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination shows no localizing signs of infection, and his laboratory results indicate mild leukocytosis and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is currently being treated with diazepam, haloperidol, and heparin sodium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient may continue to experience symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations, and autonomic instability. Close monitoring and adjustment of benzodiazepine dosage may be necessary to prevent progression to more severe complications like seizures or delirium tremens.
2. Infection: Although the patient does not currently show signs of infection, his immune system may be compromised due to chronic alcohol abuse. Regular monitoring for any signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and changes in mental status, is important.
3. Liver dysfunction: Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to liver damage and dysfunction. The patient's liver enzymes (ALT/AST) are slightly elevated, indicating potential liver injury. Monitoring liver function and providing appropriate supportive care may be necessary.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has a low potassium level (K of 2.8), which requires correction to prevent cardiac complications. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and appropriate supplementation may be required.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium to reduce the risk of DVT. Regular assessment for signs and symptoms of DVT, such as leg swelling or pain, is important.
6. Stress ulcer: Prolonged critical illness and alcohol withdrawal can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding and providing appropriate prophylaxis may be necessary."

His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 124/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals tongue fasciculations, tachycardia, and hallucinations.

Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a low potassium level. Other lab values, including kidney function tests and blood glucose levels, are also within normal limits.

The patient has mild leukocytosis, which is likely due to stress and steroids. There are no signs of infection, as indicated by a negative urine analysis and a chest X-ray that does not show pneumonia. The patient's history of Prinzmetal's angina is noted, but his current ECG does not show any ischemic changes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal. The patient has a history of alcohol use, with recent decreased intake leading to withdrawal symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/77 to 163/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient is receiving diazepam for alcohol withdrawal, haloperidol for agitation, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. The patient is expected to improve with continued ICU care and monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium tremens (DTs): Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur 48-72 hours after the last drink. Symptoms include confusion, agitation, hallucinations, fever, rapid heartbeat, and sweating. The patient is currently showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, so close monitoring for the development of DTs is important.
2. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can also lead to seizures, which can range from minor tremors to generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Continuous monitoring for seizure activity is necessary, and the patient should be given anticonvulsant medication as needed.
3. Infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in vital signs, is important. Prophylactic measures, such as stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, are in place to reduce the risk of infection.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows an intake of 3,943 mL and output of 3,110 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 833 mL. Close monitoring of fluid status is necessary to prevent fluid overload or dehydration.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are within normal limits, but close monitoring is still required due to the risk of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with a history of alcohol abuse.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable at this time, but close monitoring is essential to manage potential complications associated with alcohol withdrawal and ICU stay."
