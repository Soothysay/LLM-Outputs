","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, stage III chronic kidney disease, lung cancer status post wedge resection, and prostate cancer status post hormonal treatment and radiation therapy. He presented with a ruptured appendix that was medically managed, and then transferred to the ICU due to tachycardia and relative hypotension.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which is causing an irregular and rapid heart rate. His blood pressure is in the high 80s to low 90s, indicating hypotension. The patient also has a fever, dry oral mucosa, and fair air movement with diffuse expiratory wheezes on chest examination. He has mild diffuse tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen and is conversant neurologically.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood glucose level is normal, but his sodium and potassium levels are slightly low. His liver enzymes and kidney function tests are within normal range.

The patient's current treatment includes metoprolol for rate control, ciprofloxacin, olanzapine, calcium carbonate, pravastatin, MVI, omeprazole, trazodone, flaygl, Tylenol, atrovent, tiotropium, and heparin subcutaneously.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information are:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer (s/p wedge resection), and prostate cancer (s/p hormonal therapy and radiation therapy). He presented with tachycardia and relative hypotension and was transferred to the ICU.

The patient has been experiencing atrial tachycardia, which has progressed to possible intermittent atrial fibrillation (AFib). His vital signs show a heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/50 to 88/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. He is receiving metoprolol IV for rate control.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, fair air movement with diffuse expiratory wheezes, and mild diffuse tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ). His labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose, and lactic acid levels.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's runs of sinus tachycardia with atrioventricular block (AVB) and possible intermittent AFib should be further evaluated. The patient appears to be volume overloaded but intravascularly dry. Hemodynamics have worsened with diuresis. Considering his known hypertension and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CHF, Stage III CKD, lung cancer status post wedge resection, and prostate cancer status post hormonal treatment and radiation therapy. He presented with tachycardia and relative hypotension, which led to his transfer to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, ruptured appendix medically managed, and a recent episode of tachycardia. In the ICU, the patient received metoprolol for better rate control and slight improvement in blood pressures, but his systolic blood pressure still ranges from 80 to 90 mmHg. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 135 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 87/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination revealed dry oral mucosa, irregular and rapid heart rhythm, fair air movement with diffuse expiratory wheezes, and mild diffuse tenderness in the right lower quadrant.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL, hematocrit of 27.6%, platelet count of 251 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, glucose level of 122 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L. The assessment and plan include the patient's history of abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, cancer in the pancreas and prostate, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is characterized by an irregular and often rapid heart rate. It increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
2. Relative hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating relative hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and increase the risk of organ damage.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests impaired kidney function. This can be due to various factors such as dehydration, medication use, or underlying chronic kidney disease.
4. Respiratory infection: The patient's symptoms of cough, wheezing, and low oxygen saturation may indicate a respiratory infection. It can progress to pneumonia or exacerbate underlying COPD.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's positive guaiac test and history of ruptured appendix raise concerns for gastrointestinal bleeding. This can be further evaluated with an abdominal CT scan and stool analysis.
6. Infectious complications: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer treatment, he is at higher risk for infections"

   ruptured appendix medically managed, transferred to medicine floor for
   tachycardia, now transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] with tachycardia and relative
   hypotension.
   1) Tachycardia: Admission EKGs demonstrate sinus rhythm with normal
   rate, then acquired some ectopy, and then becoming more tachycardic on
   hospital days 3 and 4 with irregular rhythms.  He has a history of
   paroxysmal AF managed with atenolol/ASA by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4408**] (CHADS 2 but
   high risk for bleeding).  However, this is not shown in any of his EKGs
   in OMR. Rather, he has documented sinus tach with APBs since [**2103**].
   Etiology of tachycardia has been unclear over last 24 hrs. He responded
   well briefly to fluid bolus yesterday so it was thought he was dry. He
   does have a h/o Pulm HTN, LVH 35% and some RV dysfunction so it was
   thought he could be preload sensitive. In the past, his sepsis was also
   thought to possibly be a contributor. Other possiblities entertained
   have included anemia from GIB, pain, albuterol nebs, PE. He was changed
   to Xopenex overnight and CTA has ruled out PE

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of CHF, stage III CKD, lung cancer status post wedge resection, and prostate cancer status post hormonal treatment and radiation therapy. He presented with a ruptured appendix that was medically managed, and later transferred to the ICU due to tachycardia and relative hypotension. The patient has several medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GIB: The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by guaiac positive stool and a decrease in hematocrit levels. This can lead to anemia and hypotension.
2. AF: The patient has a history of paroxysmal AF and is currently experiencing irregular rhythms. Uncontrolled AF can lead to heart complications and may require rate or rhythm control measures.
3. COPD: The patient has COPD, which can worsen with exacerbations. Increased wheezing and respiratory distress indicate a possible COPD exacerbation. Proper management is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
4. CKD: The patient has stage III CKD, and his creatinine levels are being monitored. Proper medication dosing and close monitoring of renal function are important to prevent further deterioration of kidney function.
5. Ruptured Appendix: The patient initially presented with a ruptured appendix, which was"

   high risk for bleeding).  Initial presentation was asymptomatic and
   relatively asymptomatic tonight from afib and RVR with relative
   hypotension as he is mentating well and denying SOB, chest pain, palp,
   etc...  Nevertheless, would definitely benefit from better rate control
   and cardiac mechanics as well as avoiding stress of tachycardic given
   CAD.    Unclear precipitant to afib tonight as despite diuresis pt is
   overall quite positive for hospitalization so unlikely to be overall
   volume down. Potentially, greater respiratory effort (though pt denies)
   could trigger AF though he reports dyspnea is stable.  Also persistent
   infection though pt remained afebrile.
   - rate control <110 and MAP>55, will stop atenolol and convert to
   metoprolol in order to titrate up more quickly (will hold off on
   further PO dosing given atenolol given at 8pm and metoprolol IV*2)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer (CA) status post wedge resection, and prostate cancer (CA) status post hormonal therapy and radiation therapy. He presented with a ruptured appendix, which was medically managed, and was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia and relative hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 126/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include poor dentition, symmetric breath sounds with crackles at the bases bilaterally and faint wheezes, diffusely tender abdomen, trace edema in both lower extremities, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and purposeful movement with normal tone. The patient is alert, oriented to time, place, and person, and responds appropriately to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal a positive fecal occult blood test and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer status post wedge resection, and prostate cancer status post hormonal therapy and radiation therapy. The patient presented with a ruptured appendix, which was medically managed, and subsequently transferred to the ICU for tachycardia and relative hypotension.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing runs of sinus tachycardia with atrial premature contractions (APC) and atrial tachycardia, with possible intermittent atrial fibrillation (AF). This could be due to volume overload, intrinsic sinus node dysfunction, or cardiac wheezing. The plan is to continue with beta-blockade and consult primary cardiology for further input.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is likely experiencing a combination of interstitial edema and concerns for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). IV steroid has been added, and it is recommended to keep the patient euvolemic while using nebulizers and inhaled steroids. The possibility of phlegm in the belly and cardiac wheeze is also considered.

3. Ruptured Appendicitis: The patient's ruptured appendix is stable, and surgery has been performed. Antibiotics are being administered, and the hope is that the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer (s/p wedge resection), and prostate cancer (s/p hormonal therapy and radiation therapy). The patient presented with a ruptured appendix, which was medically managed initially, but subsequently developed tachycardia and relative hypotension, leading to transfer to the ICU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Cardiac: The patient is experiencing runs of sinus tachycardia with atrial premature contractions (APCs) and atrial tachycardia. There is a possibility of intermittent atrial fibrillation (AFib), although it has not been captured well by the 12-lead ECG. The patient appears to have total body volume overload due to recent blood and fluid administration. Consultation with a primary cardiologist is recommended.
2. Ruptured appendix: The patient is stable, and surgery has been performed. The attending physician believes that ongoing antibiotic therapy is the best course of action, hoping that the perforation will wall off. The CT scan does not show signs of small bowel obstruction (SBO), and the patient does not exhibit symptoms consistent with SBO. No nasogastric tube (NGT) has been inserted.

   would favor running him even to slightly positive and seeing the effect

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer (s/p wedge resection), and prostate cancer (s/p hormonal treatment and radiation therapy).
- The patient presented with a ruptured appendix, which was medically managed. He was later transferred to the ICU for tachycardia and relative hypotension.
- The patient's current conditions include:
  1. Tachycardia: The patient has runs of sinus tachycardia with atrial premature contractions (APCs) and atrial tachycardia. There is a possibility of intermittent atrial fibrillation (AFib), but it has not been well captured by the 12-lead ECG.
  2. Ruptured appendix: The patient's appendix is stable, and he underwent surgery. Antibiotic therapy should continue.
  3. Anemia: The patient has guaiac-positive stools and diarrhea. A cycle of hematocrit (HCT) should be done, and blood cross-matching for 2 units should be initiated. Checking for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is also necessary.
  4. Chronic renal failure (CRF): The patient's urine output (UOP) should be monitored, and medications should be dosed accordingly.
- The patient has several medical complications, including abdominal pain,"

   24 Hour Events:
   - PICC placed
   - abdominal CT read as SBO and ruptured appx but clinically, pt's
   symptoms were not consistent with SBO given that he was still passing
   gas and had bowel movements
   - surgery:  continue antibx, clear liquid diet, patient does not have
   SBO
   - GI:  no indication for scoping at this time
   - HR remained 100-130 (multifocal atrial tach) and could not uptitrate
   metoprolol [**3-7**] SBP in 90s
   - did well all day, no c/o worsening abdominal pain, hemodynamically
   stable
   - got lasix 10 mg iv x 1 (was positive 1.2L) and put out ~500cc with
   drop in SBP by 10 points to MAP of 60.  Gave back some of loss in 250
   cc bolus.
   S: Pt says abd pain is signficantly improved [**3-15**] at baseline, and [**7-13**]

   paroxysmal AF managed with atenolol/ASA by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4408**] (CHADS 2 but
   high risk for bleeding).  However, this is not shown in any of his EKGs
   in OMR. Rather, he has documented sinus tach with APBs since [**2103**].
   Etiology of tachycardia has been unclear over last 24 hrs. He responded
   well briefly to fluid bolus yesterday so it was thought he was dry. He
   does have a h/o Pulm HTN, LVH 35% and some RV dysfunction so it was
   thought he could be preload sensitive. In the past, his sepsis was also
   thought to possibly be a contributor. Other possiblities entertained
   have included anemia from GIB, pain, albuterol nebs, PE. He was changed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer status post wedge resection, and prostate cancer status post hormonal therapy and radiation therapy. He presented with a ruptured appendix that was medically managed, and then transferred to the ICU due to tachycardia and relative hypotension.

The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) managed with atenolol/ASA. However, his current rhythms have shown sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats (APBs). The etiology of his tachycardia has been unclear, but it responded well to a fluid bolus initially. Other possible causes include anemia from gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), pain, albuterol nebs, pulmonary embolism (PE). A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) ruled out PE.

The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with a dropping hematocrit (Hct) level. He received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently stable. The gastrointestinal (GI) department consulted and recommended deferring scope for now since the Hct is stable. The patient's chronic kidney disease (CKD) is being monitored with a decreasing creatinine level. His COPD"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), Stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer (CA) post-wedge resection, and prostate CA post hormonal therapy and radiation therapy. The patient presented with a ruptured appendix and was initially managed medically. He was then transferred to the ICU due to tachycardia and relative hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 110 bpm (with a range of 105-156 bpm), blood pressure of 103/63 mmHg (with a range of 49-112/35-101 mmHg), respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute (with a range of 23-39 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26.1 K/uL, acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with a hemoglobin drop from 24.4% to 38.0%, and worsening renal function with a decrease in hemoglobin from 23.9% to 38.0%. The patient also has a history of lung and prostate cancer.

The patient's medications include metoprolol, pantoprazole, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), flowsheets data, respiratory support, and various other lab results. The patient's assessment and plan involve managing his tachycardia, ruptured appendix, leukocytosis, GIB, worsening renal function, COPD, and other comorbidities.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of CHF due to fluid overload, further deterioration of renal function, development of sepsis or nosocomial pneumonia due to prolonged ICU stay and immunosuppressive therapy, and worsening of COPD due to increased respiratory secretions and immobilization.

Please note that this summary is based on the given information, and a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition would require further assessment by a healthcare professional."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer post-wedge resection, and prostate cancer post-hormonal treatment and radiation therapy. He presented with a ruptured appendix, which was managed medically, and then developed tachycardia and relative hypotension. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events include the development of a rash on the buttocks and perineum, which is suspected to be fungal. The patient also experienced worsening atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray.

Cardiac consult recommended trying digoxin IV for rate control due to sinus tachycardia and switching beta-blockers to calcium channel blockers due to wheezing. A gastrointestinal consult recommended a kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) study and diet restrictions to sips only.

The patient's allergies are unknown. Recent antibiotic use includes metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Other ICU medications include metoprolol, pantoprazole (Protonix), and flowsheet data as of 06:59 AM.

Physical examination findings include tachycardia, no murmurs, clear to breath sounds bilaterally, soft abdomen that is slightly distended with tenderness"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), Stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer (CA) after wedge resection, and prostate cancer (CA) after hormonal treatment and radiation therapy. The patient presented with a ruptured appendix, which was managed medically. He was transferred to the medicine floor for tachycardia and is now in the ICU with tachycardia and relative hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be physiological due to decreased preload caused by worsening renal function, pulmonary hypertension, and biventricular systolic dysfunction. Other possibilities include anemia from gastrointestinal bleeding, pain, or albuterol nebs. PE has been ruled out.
2. Ruptured Appendix: No surgical plan for the ruptured appendix has been made.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 13 to 26 over two days, which is concerning for Clostridium difficile infection or abscess. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and broadening antibiotics may be necessary if resistance is detected.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient continues to have grossly bloody stool despite receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells. A gastrointestinal follow-up is planned, and transfusion for hematocrit (Hct)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), Stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer post-wedge resection, and prostate cancer post-hormonal therapy and radiation therapy. He presented with a ruptured appendix, which was medically managed. He then developed tachycardia and relative hypotension, leading to his transfer to the ICU.

24-hour events include no gastrointestinal recurs, no dietary recommendations as the patient remains distended with rising white blood cell (WBC) count. The patient's tachycardia is likely related to infection, and he has a rash on his back. Allergies are noted as none.

The patient received various medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole), pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. He also received other medications such as pravastatin.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,950 mL with outputs including 1,665 mL of blood products, urine, and drains resulting in a balance of 285 mL. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has a blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), lung cancer post-wedge resection, and prostate cancer post-hormonal therapy and radiation treatment. The patient presented on 3/29 with a ruptured appendix that was medically managed. He was transferred to the medicine floor for tachycardia and is now in the ICU with tachycardia and relative hypotension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 104 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and maintenance fluids.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the general, head/eyes/nose, or cardiovascular systems. There is concern for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with bronchospasm and a possible pulmonary infection. The abdomen is soft but distended, and there is erythematous rash over the scrotum and surrounding area.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. Other lab values include elevated potassium, lactate, and troponin-T, as well as decreased albumin and calcium levels. The"
