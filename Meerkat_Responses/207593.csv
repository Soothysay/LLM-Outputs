 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   75 yo M with chronic respiratory failure with trach, COPD, ESRD, DM 2,
   infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior VAPs/HAPs with
   complicated hospital course who now is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   recurrent hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension - Recurrent problem for pt promting multiple floor to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] transfers. Has been documented to have SBPs measured in 70-80s
   using cuff on R arm during prior [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] admit without signs of end organ
   compromise. Has also been previously demonstrated to have [**Hospital Unit Name **] very
   sensitive to use of narcotics, which pt does require for pain [**1-17**] stage
   IV sacral decub ulcer. Worsening SBPs on floor are also concerning for
   septic physiology given known sources of infection (large decub ulcer
   and Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas PNA). All cxs since [**11-29**]
   have been negative with exception of yeast in urine cx on [**12-6**]. WBC
   also trending downwards and has had no fevers in > 72 hrs. PE and
   adrenal insufficiency remain on differential; however had [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   during most recent [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] course that was unrevealing. Doubt cardiac
   ischemia as 1 set of CEs thus far unrevealing, EKG unrevealing. Lastly,
   prior transfer to ICU for hypotension was also post HD with UF removal.
   - Continue to bolus IVFs to bring SBPs back to mid 70-80s (prior
   baseline) or for symptomatic hypotension. Will closely monitor pt's
   mental status. Anuric at baseline to unable to monitor UOP.
   - f/u bld cxs.
   - Consider repeating sputum cx if worsening leukocytosis.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs with tobramycin, meropenem, and po
   vancomycin.
   - Will need tobramycin troughs post HD.
   - Appreciate ID recs.
   - Complete ROMI with 2nd set of CEs with am labs.
   - Discuss with renal about possibly being less aggressive with UF
   removal at HD.
   - Consider restarting midodrine.
   - Will need to be cautious with narcotic use.
   - Consider checking TTE, V/Q scan if hypotension persists without clear
   etiology.
   - Unfortunately, pt's hypotension has become a recurrent problem. It
   appears that at baseline, measured [**Hospital Unit Name **] by cuff are lower than normal,
   with PVD possibly contributing. He also has an infected stage IV decub
   ulcer, for which he and his family have declined a diverting colostomy.
   Thus, underlying infection and septic physiology will be an unresolved
   matter. Will readdress goals of care with family and pt again in am.
   .
   # Leukocytosis - WBC 16.2, improving from prior peak at 29.2. No longer
   with low grade fevers. Although pt does have 2 active sources of
   infection, they appear to be clinically improving with broad abx
   coverage.
   - d/c'd daptomycin earlier today given no clear gram positive source on
   cx data.
   - Continue IV meropenem, tobramycin dosed at HD, and po vancomycin for
   possible c. diff.
   - f/u bld cxs.
   - Monitor PICC site, already has bld cxs pending from [**12-11**] off PICC.
   - Appreciate ID following, will continue to follow recs.
   - Continue to monitor WBC count, fever curve.
   .
   # Stage IV coccygeal ulcer - Plastic surgery and ID following.
   Continuously contaminated with fecal matter and plan was for colostomy
   until pt and family declined.
   - Continue wound care.
   - Continue broad spectrum abxs as above.
   - f/u plastic surgery recs. Prior recs appreciated.
   - Debridements per plastics.
   - Pain control with lidocaine patches, fentanyl patch.
   - Caution with narcotic pre-medication prior to dressing changes.
   .
   # Chronic Respiratory Failure: Known hx of hypercarbic/hypoxic
   respiratory failure now s/p trachostomy from early [**2149**]. Prior BAL from
   [**8-24**] without endobronchial lesions or tracheobronchomalacia. Pt has had
   h/o MRSA, pseudomonal, actinobacter, serratia PNA. Most recent sputum
   cxs with resistant Acetinobacter, psueudomonas.
   - broad spectrum abx as above.
   - Continue trach mask O2 supplementation for now.
   - Check ABG if pt becomes more somnolent.
   .
   # ESRD: On HD, [**1-17**] to diabetic nephropathy. Although HD line has
   surrounding erythema, per renal, has had this stable appearance with
   negative blood cxs.
   - Continue renagel.
   - f/u bld cxs.
   - Continue to monitor HD line site exam.
   - Notify renal about possibly removing less UF during next HD session
   as above.
   - Dosing tobramycin at HD. Needs trough levels post-HD.
   - f/u renal recs.
   .
   # CAD: TTE [**3-24**] (EF 50% to 55%) with dilated LV cavity. No signs of
   active cardiac ischemia on labs or EKG. Elevated troponin in setting of
   renal failure, and stable from prior checks.
   -Continue statin, off BB until [**Month/Year (2) **] tolerate.
   -Obtaining 2nd set of CEs as above.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Pt with therapeutic INR. Coumadin again held
   today for possibility of feeding tube placement.
   - Holding coumadin for now.
   - Off nodal agents until [**Month/Year (2) **] can better tolerate.
   .
   # Type II DM: Continue ISS and Lantus.
   .
   # R BKA/PVD:
   - Continue current wound care
   - Vascular surgery previously following, have since signed off.

   - Continued outpatient follow up
   .
   # FEN: NPO, has NGT in place for meds and tube feeds. Plan on floor was
   for repeat S&S eval, possibility of PEG placement.
   - S&S eval when MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] improve.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for recurrent hypotension, which has been documented in the 70-80s using cuff on the right arm without signs of end-organ compromise. The patient is also sensitive to narcotics, requiring pain control for stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer. Other medical conditions include leukocytosis, stage IV coccygeal ulcer, chronic respiratory failure with tracheostomy, ESRD on hemodialysis, and coronary artery disease with ejection fraction of 50-55%. The patient has a history of hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, MRSA, pseudomonal, actinobacter, and serratia pneumonia. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics including tobramycin, meropenem, and oral vancomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's recurrent hypotension needs to be closely monitored and managed. The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the 70-80s, and there is a concern for septic physiology due to known sources of infection. The patient's sensitivity to narcotics should be considered when managing pain.

2. Leukocytosis: Although the patient's WBC count is improving from a peak of 29."

   # Hypotension - Recurrent problem for pt prompting multiple floor to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] transfers. Has been documented to have SBPs measured in 70-80s
   using cuff on R arm during prior [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] admit without signs of end organ
   compromise. Has also been previously demonstrated to have BPs very
   sensitive to use of narcotics, which pt does require for pain [**1-17**] stage
   IV sacral decub ulcer. Concern for septic physiology given known
   sources of infection (large decub ulcer and Acinetobacter baumanii and
   Pseudomonas PNA). All cxs since [**11-29**] have been negative with exception
   of yeast in urine cx on [**12-6**]. Also sputum cx [**12-12**] now with GNR, GPR,
   GNC.  WBC stable for last several days has had no fevers in > 72 hrs.
   Lastly, hypotension also likely related to HD.  CE neg x2

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), DM2 (type 2 diabetes), infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple previous ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP) episodes. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for recurrent hypotension.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed:
1. Hypotension - The patient has recurrent episodes of low blood pressure (70-80s) and is sensitive to narcotics. There is concern for sepsis due to known sources of infection, such as a large decubitus ulcer and Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure may also be affected by hemodialysis (HD).
2. Leukocytosis - The patient's white blood cell count has risen again to 24, and he no longer has low-grade fevers. This indicates a possible ongoing infection.
3. Stage IV coccygeal ulcer - The patient has an infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer that is continuously contaminated with fecal matter. A colostomy was planned but declined by the patient.
4. Chronic Respiratory Failure - The patient has a history of hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure and has undergone a tracheostomy. He has had"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy, COPD, ESRD, DM2, infected stage IV coccygeal ulcer, and multiple prior ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP) episodes. The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for recurrent hypotension without signs of end-organ compromise. He has been previously demonstrated to have blood pressures sensitive to narcotic use, which he requires for pain management due to stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient has known sources of infection (large decubitus ulcer and Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas pneumonia), and his sputum culture is now positive for GNR, GPR, GNC. His white blood cell count is stable, and he has no fevers in over 72 hours. Hypotension is likely related to hemodialysis (HD). The patient's pain management should be cautious due to the risk of hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's recurrent hypotension is a significant concern and can be related to various factors such as sepsis, hemodialysis, or medication effects. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Sepsis: The presence of known sources of infection (large decubitus ulcer and Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas"
