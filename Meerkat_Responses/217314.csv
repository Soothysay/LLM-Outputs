","The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) complicated by cirrhosis, known esophageal varices, and multiple episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for acute hypoxemia due to aspiration and now presents with worsening hypoxemia in the setting of a likely repeat aspiration. Serial chest X-rays are concerning for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. He is agitated and has scleral icterus, regular heart rhythm, and no murmur appreciated. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral crackles. The abdomen is moderately firm with hypoactive bowel sounds, but non-tender. There is a fluid wave present, indicating ascites. The patient has 3+ edema bilaterally and asterixis.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.2 x 10^9/L, slightly elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate level, and low albumin level. Imaging shows bilateral fluffy infiltrates consistent with ARDS.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing hypoxemia management with continued BiPAP and consideration for"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a complicated medical history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), cirrhosis, esophageal varices, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been admitted multiple times for acute hypoxemia due to aspiration and is currently in the ICU for a repeat episode of aspiration. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 89%, and temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius.

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral icterus, regular heart sounds without murmurs, decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally with rare expiratory rhonchi, moderately firm abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds but non-tender, and 3+ bilateral edema with Wernicke's encephalopathy (asterixis).

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.2 thousand/mm3, hematocrit of 30.8%, platelet count of 134 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, total CO2 level of 21 mmol/L, blood glucose level of 111 mg/dL, and liver function tests with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o ESLD d/t PSC, EF 35%, recent course notable for fungal
   peritonitis, variceal bleed; now admitted for hypoxemia in setting of
   presumed aspiration.
   Hypoxemia: Clinical scenario most consistent with recurrent
   aspiration.  CXR with developing infiltrates.  Required NIPPV overnight
   due to tachypnea and hypoxemia. PaO2 still at 50 with Bipap
 now
   intubated.
       -Low tidal volume ventilation
       -Check sputum culture
       -Given likely aspiration, will not pursue w/u of other etiologies
   at present (eg PE)
    Leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis: continue current
   antibiotics.
   Varices, h/o GI bleed: S/P recent banding
     -Continue to monitor HCT, PPI.
     -Currently not on home dose nadolol, will touch base with GI to see
   if this is recommended if pressure is stable.
   Cirrhosis: ursidiol, lactulose.  Trend lfts.  Communication with liver
   team re: transplant status.
   Malnutrition: significant issue, esp given d/c of NGTs.  Start tube
   feeds after intubation.
   Hypernatremia: continue to replace free water, follow serial sodiums.
   Confusion: likely some component of hepatic encephalopathy, +/-
   infection, prolonged hospitalization, etc; appears stable over past few

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to PSC (primary sclerosing cholangitis), an EF (ejection fraction) of 35%, recent course notable for fungal peritonitis and variceal bleed. He is currently admitted for hypoxemia in the setting of presumed aspiration. The patient's medical history includes CAD (coronary artery disease) with s/p CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting), cirrhosis, malnutrition, hypernatremia, and confusion. He has multiple comorbidities and a recent history of GI (gastrointestinal) bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing recurrent aspiration, leading to hypoxemia and requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is an increased risk of further respiratory failure due to the patient's compromised lung function and underlying liver disease.

2. Infection: The patient has a history of fungal peritonitis and is currently on antibiotics. Given his immunocompromised state due to ESLD and potential for aspiration, he is at an increased risk of developing new infections such as pneumonia or sepsis.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's confusion may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver cirrhosis. This condition can lead to altered mental status and requires close monitoring and management.

4. GI Bleeding"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o ESLD d/t PSC, EF 35%, recent course notable for fungal
   peritonitis, variceal bleed; now admitted for hypoxemia in setting of
   presumed aspiration.
   Hypoxemia: Clinical scenario most consistent with recurrent
   aspiration.  CXR with developing infiltrates.  Required NIPPV overnight
   due to tachypnea and hypoxemia. PaO2 still at 50 with Bipap.
       -Given etiology of resp failure and persistent hypoxemia, would not
   continue NIPPV at present but instead proceed to intubation
       -Low tidal volume ventilation
       -Check sputum culture
       -Given likely aspiration, will not pursue w/u of other etiologies
   at present (eg PE)
    Leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis: continue current
   antibiotics.
   Varices, h/o GI bleed: S/P recent banding
     -Continue to monitor HCT, PPI.
     -Currently not on home dose nadolol, will touch base with GI to see
   if this is recommended if pressure is stable.
   Cirrhosis: ursidiol, lactulose.  Trend lfts.  Communication with liver
   team re: transplant status.
   Malnutrition: significant issue, esp given d/c of NGTs.  Start tube
   feeds after intubation.
   Hypernatremia: continue to replace free water, follow serial sodiums.
   Confusion: likely some component of hepatic encephalopathy, +/-
   infection, prolonged hospitalization, etc; appears stable over past few
   days.

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with end-stage liver disease due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an ejection fraction of 35%, and a recent history of fungal peritonitis and variceal bleeding. The patient is admitted for hypoxemia in the setting of presumed aspiration. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 109/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on CPAP. 

The patient has diminished bilateral breath sounds and rhonchi, as well as a distended abdomen with positive ascites. Neurologic examination reveals asterixis, but no other focal deficits are noted. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelets, with decreased creatinine, total CO2, and albumin. The PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated, while the CK/CKMB/Troponin-T levels are within normal limits. Liver function tests are slightly elevated, and electrolytes show hypernatremia. Imaging shows increased bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. 

The assessment and plan include hypoxemia due to recurrent aspiration, for which noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was required overnight. Due to persistent hypoxemia, intubation is planned. Low"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and multiple episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has been admitted multiple times for acute hypoxemia due to aspiration, and this time he was transferred to the ICU again for acute hypoxemia in the setting of a likely repeat aspiration. Serial chest X-rays are concerning for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxemia, hypotension, persistent leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver failure/cirrhosis, biliary strictures, hypernatremia, ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hyperlipidemia, depression/ADHD, and familial endocrine neoplasm (FEN).

The patient is currently intubated and receiving ARDSNET ventilation. He is also on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and caspofungin, to cover for aspiration pneumonia and other infections. The patient's blood and urine cultures are negative, but repeat cultures have been ordered.

The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding has been managed with esophageal banding, and he is currently hemodynamically stable. His liver disease is complicated by ascites, portal gastropathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) complicated by cirrhosis. He has known esophageal varices and multiple episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), for which he underwent banding this admission. The patient also had a recent ICU stay for acute hypoxemia due to aspiration and is now re-transferred to the ICU for acute hypoxemia in the setting of likely repeat aspiration. Serial chest X-rays show development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's worsening chest X-rays and declining pulmonary function tests indicate the development of ARDS. Aspiration is the most likely etiology. Other possible diagnoses like pulmonary embolism (PE) and hepatopulmonary syndrome are less likely.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to propofol administration or sepsis, possibly secondary to complicated infections and new aspiration pneumonia.
3. Persistent leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is rising, indicating an ongoing infection. Complicated medical history includes peritonitis, colangitis, and esophagitis. Negative tests for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and blood and urine cultures suggest the need for repeat cultures and continued antibiotic coverage.
4. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, and EGD was performed"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), who has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypoxemia in the setting of presumed aspiration. The patient's medical history includes recent episodes of fungal peritonitis, variceal bleed, and a previous gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. 

The patient's current condition is characterized by respiratory failure, likely secondary to recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are also signs of shock, which may be caused by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and/or sepsis. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. 

In addition, the patient has a history of cirrhosis, malnutrition, hypernatremia, confusion (potentially related to hepatic encephalopathy or infection), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and renal dysfunction. 

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume ventilation and has a quad-lumen line in place. His vital signs are stable, but he requires ongoing monitoring and management for various complications. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of ARDS, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of liver function, worsening malnutrition, worsening renal function, and possible cardiovascular events."

   presumed aspiration.
   Respiratory failure: Clinical scenario most consistent with recurrent
   aspiration and ARDS
     -Low tidal volume ventilation
     -Check sputum culture
   Shock: Likely secondary to SIRS +/- sepsis as well as sedation.  CVP
   4-6 today
     -Fluid boluses to target CVP 8-12.
     -Follow up pan culture
   Leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis.  WBC rising today.
     -Pan culture already down today.  Low threshold for broadening GNR.
    Varices, h/o GI bleed: S/P recent banding
     -Continue to monitor HCT, PPI.
     -Nadolol, lasix, spironolactone on hold for now.
   Cirrhosis: ursidiol, lactulose.  Trend lfts.  Communication with liver
   team re: transplant status.
    Malnutrition: significant issue, esp given d/c of NGTs.
      -Start tube feeds today
    Hypernatremia: Improved, will monitor.
    Confusion: likely some component of hepatic encephalopathy, +/-
   infection, prolonged hospitalization, etc; appears stable over past few
   days.
     -Continue lactulose
    CAD s/p CABG: statin, no asa; beta blocker has been held in setting of

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), who has been admitted for hypoxemia in the setting of presumed aspiration. The patient's medical history includes recent fungal peritonitis, variceal bleed, and a previous gastrointestinal bleed for which he underwent banding.

The patient's current condition is critical, and he requires intensive care unit (ICU) support. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, indicating potential shock. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) with assist/control mode, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system examination reveals crackles in the left lung field, suggesting possible left-sided atelectasis or consolidation.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.5 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation parameters. The blood cultures are pending. Imaging studies show bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient most likely has recurrent aspiration and ARDS, as indicated by low tidal volume ventilation and pending sputum culture.
2. Shock"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old man with a complicated medical history including PSC complicated by cirrhosis, known esophageal varices, multiple episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), recent ICU stay for acute hypoxemia due to aspiration, and re-transferred to the ICU for acute hypoxemia in the setting of likely repeat aspiration. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia due to ARDS, intubated on ARDSNET ventilation, hypotension possibly due to propofol or sepsis, persistent leukocytosis, complicated history of peritonitis, colangitis, and esophagitis, ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding with esophageal bands placed, and evidence of ESLD/cirrhosis with complications such as ascites, portal gastropathy, and SBP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening ARDS, sepsis due to ongoing infections, worsening liver dysfunction, further episodes of GI bleeding, and complications related to the patient's other comorbidities such as CAD, hyperlipidemia, depression/ADHD, and FEN malnutrition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of portal hypertension and cirrhosis, presenting with hypoxemia due to aspiration in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is intubated and receiving ARDSNET ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate ARDS, which can lead to further respiratory failure and complications such as pneumonia or sepsis.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to propofol administration or sepsis. If not managed properly, it can result in organ perfusion issues and shock.

3. Persistent leukocytosis: The rising white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammation. It is important to monitor and treat the underlying cause to prevent further complications.

4. GI bleeding: Although currently stable, the patient's history of esophageal varices and previous upper gastrointestinal bleeding puts him at risk for recurrent bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and adjusting treatment accordingly is essential.

5. ESLD/Cirrhosis: The patient's end-stage liver disease/cirrhosis requires close monitoring for complications such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.

6. Biliary strictures: Although resolved for now, the patient's history of biliary strictures needs to be monitored, and any signs of cholangitis or worsening liver"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old individual with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. They have a history of recent fungal peritonitis and variceal bleeding. The patient is currently admitted for hypoxemia in the setting of presumed aspiration.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with clinical features consistent with recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They are receiving low tidal volume ventilation and have a sputum culture pending to rule out pneumonia (PNA).

There are indications of potential medical complications such as shock, likely secondary to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis. The patient is vasodilated and requires monitoring of pressor requirements with gentle diuresis.

The patient also has leukocytosis, bacterial, and fungal peritonitis, with a rising white blood cell count. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be considered due to the suspicion of infection.

Other issues include varices with a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, cirrhosis, malnutrition, hypernatremia, confusion, coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and access via a quad-lumen line in the internal jugular vein (IJ).

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. The patient's recent course has been notable for fungal peritonitis and a variceal bleed. He is currently admitted for hypoxemia, presumed to be secondary to aspiration.

The patient is on low tidal volume ventilation and has received 3L boluses of lactated Ringer's (LR) yesterday for low central venous pressure (CVP). He is also receiving norepinephrine at 0.12 mcg/kg/min, propofol at 30 mcg/kg/min, and other ICU medications including carafate, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/57 mmHg to 123/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's CVP is 7 mmHg, and his fluid balance shows an intake of 6,432 mL, output of 1,645 mL, and a positive balance of 4,787 mL since 12 AM.

The patient's blood products include a total output of 1,645 mL, with 845 mL of urine output. The patient's NG tube output is 42 mL, and his drain output is 118 mL. His respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist and autoflow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 16.5 to 21.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) ranging from 9.3 to 11.0 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 100 to 110 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 22 mEq/L, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 mg/dL, glucose ranging from 133 to 155 mg/dL, and lactic acid of 3.6 mmol/L. The patient's imaging shows an endotracheal tube in place, central venous catheter (CVC) in place, and worsening bilateral infiltrates with effusion on chest X-ray.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and cirrhosis, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for acute hypoxemia due to aspiration and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has a complicated medical history including esophageal varices, multiple episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and banding, as well as recent ICU stays for acute hypoxemia and ARDS. The patient is now re-transferred to the ICU for acute hypoxemia in the setting of likely repeat aspiration. Serial chest X-rays are concerning for the development of ARDS. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: Due to ARDS and repeated aspiration events.
2. Hypotension: Most likely due to propofol although sepsis is also a possibility given complicated infections.
3. Persistent leukocytosis: Complicated history of peritonitis,? colangitis, and esophagitis. Cdiff has been negative. Blood and urine cultures negative.
4. GI bleeding: EGD performed twice this admission with esophageal bands placed. Currently hemodynamically stable.
5. ESLD/Cirrhosis: On liver transplant list. Complicated by ascites, portal gastropathy, and SBP.
6. Biliary strictures: Pull back cholangiography on [**1-10**] demonstrated no obstruction. PTC drain removed"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is currently being treated for ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of complicated infections, including peritonitis, esophagitis, and pneumonia. This increases the risk of developing sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection.

3. Hepatopulmonary Syndrome (HPS): Although less likely given new clinical information, the patient's liver disease and chronic vasodilation may increase the risk of HPS. HPS is a rare lung complication of liver disease characterized by shortness of breath.

4. Portopulmonary Hypertension (PoPH): The patient's history of portal hypertension and liver disease raises the possibility of developing PoPH, which is pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with portal hypertension.

5. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has had multiple episodes of aspiration, which can result in aspiration pneumonia. This is a type of lung infection caused by inhaling food, liquid, or stomach contents into the lungs.

6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to esophageal varices. This can lead to hypotension and shock if not managed promptly.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o ESLD d/t PSC, EF 35%, recent course notable for fungal
   peritonitis, variceal bleed; now admitted for hypoxemia in setting of
   presumed aspiration.
   Respiratory failure: Clinical scenario most consistent with recurrent
   aspiration and ARDS.  Thus far sputum culture/lack of fever not
   suggesting PNA. CXR, and vent requirements improved with diuresis.
     -[**Year (4 digits) **] today
     -If fails [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] observe on PSV.
     -Continue pulmonary toilet.
    Shock: Likely secondary to SIRS +/- sepsis as well as sedation.  Also
   vasodilated. Tolerate diiuresis without increase in pressor
   requirements.
      -Target CVP 6-8
      -Monitor pressor requirement off propofol
    Leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis.  WBC down today.
      -f/u pan culture.
      -Low threshold for broadening GNR.
    Varices, h/o GI bleed: S/P recent banding
      -Continue to monitor HCT, PPI.
      -Nadolol, spironolactone on hold for now.
    Cirrhosis: ursidiol, lactulose.  Trend lfts.  Communication with liver
   team re: transplant status.
    Malnutrition: significant issue, esp given d/c of NGTs.  Some
   increased residuals this AM
     -Rechallenge with tube fees today
    Hypernatremia: Improved, will monitor.
    Confusion: likely some component of hepatic encephalopathy, +/-
   infection, prolonged hospitalization, etc; appears stable over past few
   days.
      -Continue lactulose
    CAD s/p CABG: statin, no asa; beta blocker has been held in setting of
   recent GI bleeds.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with end-stage liver disease due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), who presented to the ICU for hypoxemia in the setting of presumed aspiration. The patient's recent medical history includes fungal peritonitis and a variceal bleed. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). His vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/54 mmHg to 77/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging reveals an endotracheal tube and central venous catheter in place, as well as improved bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's medical complications include shock, likely secondary to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis, leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis, varices with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, cirrhosis, malnutrition, hypernatremia, and confusion. The patient's care plan includes diuresis, pulmonary toilet, monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP), weaning off propofol, following up with pan culture, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and close monitoring of liver function tests."

   71 y/o ESLD d/t PSC, EF 35%, recent course notable for fungal
   peritonitis, variceal bleed; now admitted for hypoxemia in setting of
   presumed aspiration.
   Respiratory failure: Clinical scenario most consistent with recurrent
   aspiration and ARDS.  Thus far sputum culture/lack of fever not
   suggesting PNA. CXR, and vent requirements improved with diuresis.

     -If fails [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] observe on PSV.
     -Continue pulmonary toilet.
    Shock: Likely secondary to SIRS +/- sepsis as well as sedation.  Also
   vasodilated. Tolerate diiuresis without increase in pressor
   requirements.
      -Target CVP 6-8
      -Monitor pressor requirement off propofol
    Leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis.  WBC down today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and a history of recent fungal peritonitis and variceal bleed. The patient is currently admitted for hypoxemia in the setting of presumed aspiration. The respiratory failure is consistent with recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's recent course includes leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis, and a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He also has a history of cirrhosis, malnutrition, hypernatremia, confusion, and coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines and tubes inserted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is consistent with recurrent aspiration and ARDS, which can lead to further respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis, and shock suggest the possibility of sepsis. This condition can progress rapidly and lead to multiple organ dysfunction.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's confusion may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease. Monitoring and managing electrolytes, medications, and potential precipitating factors are crucial.
4. GI Bleeding: The patient's history of variceal"

   24 Hour Events:
   -- NG tube placed; told nursing to hold tube feeds at midnight for
   possible extubation on Wed (did not attempt extubation yest)
   -- was able to wean down levophed in evening and continue slow
   diuresis, but had to go back onto low dose levo b/c CVP fell a little
   low
   -- nursing wondering about placing PICC: tape around left IJ seems to
   be irritating skin, appears uncomfortable

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis with known esophageal
   varices and multiple epidoses of UGIB and banding this admission, also
   with recent ICU stay for acute hypoxemia due to aspiration, who is now
   re-transferred to the ICU for acute hypoxemia in the setting of a
   likely repeat aspiration. Serial CXRs concerning for development of
   ARDS.
   # Hypoxemia:  Was due to ARDS. Aspiration is most likely etiology.
   Other diagnoses such as PE and hepatopulmonary syndrome are less likely
   now given new clinical information.
   -- intubated; now off sedation on having SBT
   -- although he is on pressors, he has liver dz and chronic
   vasodilatation--> so trying to diurese with lasix gtt, goal to CVP 8
   -- trend ABGs and CXR
   -- continue abx coverage: vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/caspofungin
   -- sputum [**1-23**] - no growth
   # Hypotension: Most likely due to propofol although sepsis also
   possibility given complicated infections.
   -- given ESLD, would expect CVP to be lower, would accept [**6-26**], avoid
   more boluses given that it 3rd spaces and he now has e/o pulm edema on
   CXR.
   -- was 2L negative on lasix gtt [**2185-1-25**] -- back off a bit today
    -- continue levophed titrated for MAP >65

   -- Monitor Hct, Protonix [**Hospital1 **], has CVL, and active T/S
   -- Sucralfate 1 gm PO QID
   -- holding nadolol for hypotension, but restart when off pressor and
   normotensive as no ongoing bleeding evident
   # ESLD/cirrhosis: On liver transplant list but not active given acute
   illness. Complicated by ascites, portal gastropathy, and SBP. No clear
   history of encephalopathy.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 71-year-old man with ESLD, respiratory failure, and a history of PSC complicated by cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and multiple episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was previously in the ICU for acute hypoxemia due to aspiration and is now re-transferred to the ICU for acute hypoxemia in the setting of likely repeat aspiration. Serial chest X-rays are concerning for the development of ARDS.

The patient's hypoxemia is most likely due to aspiration, although other diagnoses such as pulmonary embolism and hepatopulmonary syndrome are less likely given the new clinical information. He is intubated and off sedation, with spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) being performed. Despite being on pressors, the patient has liver disease and chronic vasodilation, so diuresis with Lasix is being attempted to achieve a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8.

The patient also has hypotension, which is most likely due to propofol although sepsis is also a possibility given the complicated infections. ESLD is expected to have a lower CVP, so efforts are being made to avoid further boluses and maintain a CVP around 6-8. Levophed is being titrated for mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65.

Persistent leukocytosis is noted, which may be due to a history of peritonitis, possible cholangitis,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 71-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, and recent history of fungal peritonitis and variceal bleed. The patient was admitted for hypoxemia in the setting of presumed aspiration and is currently experiencing respiratory failure consistent with recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient also has signs of shock, likely secondary to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis, as well as vasodilation. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient has a history of bacterial and fungal peritonitis, and blood cultures are pending. Broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage for gram-negative rods (GNR) should be considered.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and varices, and recent banding has been performed. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR), indicating impaired liver function.

The patient is also suffering from malnutrition, especially with the discontinuation of nasogastric tube feeds. Once the patient is extubated, tube feeds can be restarted.

The patient has hypernatremia, which may be related to diuresis. Close monitoring of serum sodium levels should be done"

He also has a recent ICU stay for acute hypoxemia due to aspiration and is now re-transferred to the ICU for acute hypoxemia in the setting of likely repeat aspiration. Serial chest X-rays are concerning for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient has been extubated and is now off sedation. He is being kept NPO (nothing by mouth) to avoid aspiration, and tube feeds via NG (nasogastric) tube are ongoing. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/66 to 114/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 128 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 119 to 155 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes including ALT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). He has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 35% and has recently experienced fungal peritonitis and a variceal bleed. The patient was admitted for hypoxemia related to presumed aspiration and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's clinical scenario is consistent with recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is a need to continue pulmonary toilet and aspiration precautions.
2. Shock: The patient likely had shock secondary to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and possible sepsis, as well as vasodilation. This condition has now resolved.
3. Leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection. He has a history of bacterial and fungal peritonitis, and follow-up cultures are needed.
4. Tube feed residuals: The patient has an increased risk of aspiration due to tube feed residuals. The nasogastric tube should be placed on suction, and reglan should be restarted.
5. Varices, history of GI bleed: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and recent banding. Monitoring of hematocrit (HCT) and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) usage is important. Nadolol and spironol"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old individual with end-stage liver disease due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an ejection fraction of 35%, and a recent history of fungal peritonitis and variceal bleed. The patient was admitted for hypoxemia in the setting of presumed aspiration.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely caused by recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is no evidence of pneumonia based on sputum culture and lack of fever. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient also experienced shock, which was secondary to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and possible sepsis, as well as vasodilation. The shock has now resolved.

The patient has leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis, and an increasing risk of aspiration due to tube feed residuals. The patient's nasogastric tube (NGT) will be kept on suction, and reglan will be restarted.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and recent banding. The patient's varices will continue to be monitored, and medications such as nadolol and spironolactone will be held for now.

The patient has cirrhosis and is being treated with ursodiol and lactulose. There are trends in liver function tests (LFTs).

The patient has hypernatremia, which is slightly up with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a complex medical history, including primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), cirrhosis, esophageal varices, ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hyperlipidemia, depression/ADHD, and feeding tube placement (FEN). He was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemia due to aspiration and has had multiple episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient is on the liver transplant list but not actively listed due to his acute illness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's recent episodes of acute hypoxemia suggest a potential for recurrent aspiration events. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions, such as airway protection and respiratory support, should be considered.
2. Persistent leukocytosis: The patient's persistent elevated white blood cell count indicates ongoing inflammation or infection. Further evaluation, including blood and sputum cultures, should be done to identify the causative agent and guide targeted antibiotic therapy.
3. GI bleeding: Despite the placement of esophageal bands, there is a risk of recurrent UGIB. Close monitoring of vital signs, especially hemodynamic stability, and ongoing assessment for signs of bleeding are necessary. Nasogastric tube aspiration and endoscopy may be required to evaluate the source of bleeding.
4. ESLD/cirrhosis: The patient's cirrh"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), cirrhosis, known esophageal varices, and multiple episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has had recent ICU stays for acute hypoxemia due to aspiration and is now back in the ICU for another episode of likely repeat aspiration.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient experienced an episode of acute hypoxemia that was likely due to aspiration. He was treated with vancomycin and completed the course on 1/27. Currently, he is doing well on nasal cannula oxygen.

2. Persistent leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) has improved, indicating a possible resolution of the infection. He was previously on vancomycin, but it was completed yesterday. Recent cultures are pending.

3. GI bleeding: The patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) twice during this admission with esophageal bands placed to prevent further bleeding. No recent evidence of bleeding was found, and his hematocrit (Hct) remains stable.

4. ESLD/cirrhosis: The patient is on the liver transplant list but is not currently active due to acute illness. He has complications of ascites, portal gastropathy, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). There is no clear"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), end-stage liver disease (ESLD), recurrent aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and other comorbidities such as ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hyperlipidemia, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The patient has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications including acute hypoxemia due to aspiration, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and potential development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia likely secondary to aspiration, hypotension that has resolved but remains borderline, persistent leukocytosis with a history of peritonitis, colangitis, and esophagitis, and hypernatremia with a trend of increasing sodium levels.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 89/57 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 3,532 mL with an output of 1,945 mL, resulting in a balance"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old individual with end-stage liver disease due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, and a recent history of fungal peritonitis and variceal bleed. The patient was admitted for hypoxemia in the setting of presumed aspiration and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has experienced recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There are no signs of pneumonia based on the lack of fever and sputum culture results. The patient's white blood cell count has normalized, indicating improvement from leukocytosis, bacterial, and fungal peritonitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's clinical scenario suggests recurrent aspiration and ARDS. Continuous pulmonary toilet and aspiration precautions should be continued.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had leukocytosis, which has now normalized. Monitoring for any signs of infection or recurrence of leukocytosis is important.
3. Tube feed residuals: Increased tube feed residuals pose a risk of aspiration. Continuing slow increases in tube feeding and monitoring for residuals are necessary.
4. Varices and history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: The patient has a history of variceal bleed and recent banding. Monitoring hemoglobin concentration and continuing proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is recommended.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis and is being"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o ESLD d/t PSC, EF 35%, recent course notable for fungal
   peritonitis, variceal bleed; now admitted for hypoxemia in setting of
   presumed aspiration.
   Respiratory failure: Clinical scenario most consistent with recurrent
   aspiration and ARDS.  Thus far sputum culture/lack of fever not
   suggesting PNA.  Extubated successfully [**1-26**].
     -Continue pulmonary toilet
     -Aspiration precautions
    Leukocytosis, bacterial and fungal peritonitis.  WBC now normalized.
     -Vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] stopped yesterday. Caspo to continue per ID
   Tube feed residuals:  Increases risk of aspiration
     -Continue slow increase of TF and monitor for residuals
     -Continue Reglan
    Varices, h/o GI bleed: S/P recent banding
     -Continue to monitor HCT, PPI.
    Cirrhosis: ursidiol, lactulose.  Trend lfts.
     -Restart lasix/sprironolactone to attempt to manage ascites
    Hypernatremia:  Improved with free water
    Confusion: likely some component of hepatic encephalopathy, +/-
   infection, prolonged hospitalization, etc; slightly clearer today.
     -Continue lactulose

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old individual with end-stage liver disease due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). They have a low ejection fraction (EF) of 35% and have recently experienced fungal peritonitis and a variceal bleed. The patient was admitted for hypoxemia in the setting of presumed aspiration and is currently in respiratory failure consistent with recurrent aspiration and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). They were successfully extubated on January 26th.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's clinical scenario is most consistent with recurrent aspiration and ARDS. It is important to continue pulmonary toilet and aspiration precautions.
2. Leukocytosis, Bacterial and Fungal Peritonitis: The patient has leukocytosis and a history of bacterial and fungal peritonitis. With the normalization of WBC, it is important to continue monitoring and managing any signs of infection.
3. Tube Feed Residuals: The patient has an increased risk of aspiration due to tube feed residuals. It is crucial to continue slow increases in tube feeding and monitor for residuals while continuing Reglan.
4. Varices, History of GI Bleed: The patient has a history of variceal bleeding and recent banding. Monitoring hematocrit (HCT) levels and continuing proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is important.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, and management should include"
