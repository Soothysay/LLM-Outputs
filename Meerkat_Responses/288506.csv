","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is currently without complaints and denies chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, or shoulder pain.
- On TTE, severe LV systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20-25% consistent with multi-vessel CAD was observed. Right ventricular function is normal, and there is mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension was also noted.
- Patient received Lasix 40 mg IV and showed improvement in symptoms.
- Patient has a history of statin intolerance and myalgias in the past.
- Heparin gtt is being continued.
- Consult has been requested for CT, UA, HbA1c, CXR (PA&LAT), carotid u/s, and repeat WBC.
- CK levels are trending down.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms.
- Vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 87-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65-76 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,171 mL and output of 2,940 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,769 mL.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, normal heart sounds, crackles at the bases of the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, and notable ecchymosis of the glans penis and scrotum.
- Neurologic examination is not assessed.
- Labs show elevated WBC count of 18.5 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 13.9 g/dL, elevated troponin-T levels, elevated creatinine levels, and other abnormal lab results.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous intolerance to statins. He presented with symptoms consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), specifically a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's initial troponin T levels were elevated at 7.89, indicating myocardial damage. He was started on heparin, aspirin, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) was found to be severely reduced at 20-25%. He also has evidence of heart failure, as shown by crackles on lung auscultation and an echocardiogram revealing moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient's blood glucose level was elevated at 218 mg/dL, and his white blood cell count (WBC) was high at 18.5 K/uL, possibly due to the MI or a concurrent infection. Other lab results indicated elevated cardiac enzymes and liver enzymes.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI, NSTEMI): The patient's chest pain, elevated troponin T levels, and history of CAD suggest an acute coronary syndrome. He is being managed with aspirin, heparin, carvedilol, and atorvastatin.
2. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Ac"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute left ventricular systolic dysfunction, likely secondary to an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The patient's ejection fraction (EF) on echocardiogram is 20-25%. The patient has been managed with aspirin, carvedilol, ACE inhibitor, heparin, and statin therapy. 

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate 93 bpm, blood pressure 91/59 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97% on nasal cannula. 

Physical examination findings include crackles bilaterally at the lung bases, soft and non-tender abdomen, and notable ecchymosis of the glans penis and scrotum without tenderness. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 18.5 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels at 7.89 (above the upper limit of normal), elevated creatinine (Cr) at 0.9 mg/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 875 IU/L. 

The patient's plan includes continued management for acute myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, and pain control. Further assessments and plans include obtaining a urine analysis (u/a), checking"

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension, gout, and a recent STEMI (heart attack). He underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have severe triple vessel disease that is not amenable to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) intervention. As a result, the plan is for him to undergo coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery this morning.

The patient experienced an episode of chest pain (CP) and ECG changes yesterday, prompting the placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) at 1:1 ratio. His hemoglobin levels have been declining, from 35% to 31.4% to 29.2%. A CT scan has been ordered this morning to rule out retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed).

The patient's thyroid function tests (TFTs) are within normal limits. He has a large goiter noted on chest X-ray yesterday, but his thyroid function is normal. There is notable ecchymosis of the glans penis and scrotum, likely due to blood tracking from catheterization. He denies tenderness but reported a drop of blood in his urine. The urinalysis (u/a) shows blood but no evidence of infection. The groin exam is stable, and there is a low threshold to consult urology.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of left shoulder pain in the morning, which was thought to be an anginal equivalent. The patient has a history of ECG changes similar to pre-cath and has undergone an Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) placement at 1:1 ratio, with cardiac surgery team aware and planning for an operation in the morning. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been decreasing from 35% to 29.2%, and the surgical team requested a stat CT scan to rule out retroperitoneal bleed. The patient's thyroid function tests (TFTs) are within normal limits, and carotid doppler studies show 40% stenosis on both sides.

The patient overnight was asymptomatic and resting comfortably, continuing on nitro drip and heparin drip. This morning, the patient reports feeling well, denying chest pain (CP), shortness of breath (SOB), or any other symptoms. The patient's telemetry shows normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with no events.

The patient has allergies to shellfish-derived products and an unknown allergy. The last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is currently receiving infusions of nitroglycerin at 0.25 mcg/kg/min and heparin sodium at 1,450 units/hour. Other ICU medications and changes to medical and family history are not mentioned"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with severe 3-vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) intervention. He presented with chest pain and had an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with significant risk factors. The patient was started on aspirin, carvedilol, an ACE inhibitor, heparin, and atorvastatin. A cardiac surgery consultation was requested, and pre-operative workup was ordered to evaluate the possibility of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient has a history of severe 3-vessel disease and experienced an episode of angina in the morning, indicating ongoing myocardial ischemia or unstable angina.
2. Bleeding: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been decreasing, suggesting ongoing bleeding or hemodynamic instability. A stat CT scan was requested to rule out retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed).
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may indicate poor cardiac output or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient has crackles bilaterally at the bases of the lungs, which may suggest pulmonary edema or heart failure.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, indicating possible platelet consumption or disseminated intrav"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension, gout, and a recent STEMI who underwent catheterization. He has severe triple vessel disease that is not amenable to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) intervention. The plan is for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) this morning. 

The patient experienced left shoulder pain in the morning, which was thought to be an anginal equivalent with ECG changes similar to pre-cath. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed, and the patient is currently at 1:1. The hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been declining from 35% to 29.2%, and a CT scan was requested this morning to rule out retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed). Thyroid function tests (TFTs) were also ordered, which came back within normal limits. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the left shoulder pain. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, alert and oriented, overweight/obese, with distant heart sounds and crackles at the bases of the lungs. The right groin site is clean, dry, intact with no evidence of hematoma or bruits, while the left groin has a femoral IABP. Notable ecchymosis of the glans penis and scrotum is present, likely from blood tracking s/p catheterization."
