   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of afib.
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF: HF was diagnosed [**9-14**], echo during this
   admission with worsened EF to 25%. This is thought to be [**1-7**]
   arrhythmias. Pt had difficulting with diuresis on the floor due to
   hypotension. Initial cause of HF is unclear, pt had a dilated heart. Pt
   also has pulmonary HTN which may be [**1-7**] his OSA. In prior studies his
   PA systolic pressure was estimated at 60+. Clinically, his exam is more
   c/w right than left heart failure. He likely has some Left heart
   failure, which is contributing to his edema on CXR and small oxygen
   requirment.
   - lasix gtt for now, titrate to UO 100/hr
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue metolazone for now
   - may need milrinone to increase BP if not able to tolerate gtt
   - CV tomorrow (see below)
   - once no longer in afib, would repeat echo to better assess EF
   - strict I's, O's
   - will restart ACE once renal function improves
   - hold BB until HF more stable
   - continue to hold home norvasc
   - continue ASA 81mg
   - place A-line for better BP monitoring
   .
   # Atrial fib/ventricular ectopy: Likely contributing to his worsening
   HF. Pt does appear to tolearte being in afib. Likely will benifit from
   cardioversion. Pt was subtheraputic on his coumadin so will need TEE
   - heparin gtt
   - cont amio
   - NPO at midnight for CV tomorrow, will need to page TEE fellow in AM
   .
   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridment in future. WBC was elevated and temp was lower, so abx were
   brodened from cipro cefepime.
   - will continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood cx results
   - vascular recs regarding possible debridement
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr/GFR was at baseline on admission,
   now worsened in setting of diuresis and poor forward flow. Prior to his
   admission in [**9-13**] baseline Cr was 1.7, range seems to have been
   1.5-2.0.
   - monitor with diuresis
   - renally dose meds
   - will check vanco trough in AM
   - renal recs appreciated
   - may benifit from UF, but will require pressors
   .
   # AMS: had a AMS this AM. [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to low BP vs
   infection induced delerium. UA shows possible UTI. Pt had abx adjusted
   this AM. AMS may also be from OSA, however, pt refuses bipap
   - will monitor urine and blood cx
   - continue abx
   .
   # OSA: pt refuses bipap, venous ABG shows CO2 renention. This may
   expain his sleepiness.
   - consider trying a nasal bipap, unsure if pt has tried this type
   .
   # L pleural effusion: Likely transudative in setting of CHF. Small and
   stable on cxr [**2-23**]
   - will monitor
   - if enlarges or pt is febrile, consider a dx tap
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: Pt without current sx. Pt is on 20mg prednisone
   qday (normally Q48 hrs at home).
   - continue steriods for now, while pt is having transient hypotension,
   once improved will change back to home dose
   .
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol is 150 daily
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on increased steriod dose
   .
   # Anemia: likely related to CKD, was on EPO at [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor for now
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: chronic, s/p eval with negative HIT Ab, see last
   d/c summary.
   - will monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose, TSH normal, total T4 low, but
   pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked before or after it was
   started)
   - continue current dose
   - consider rechecking thyroid labs
   .
   # DMII: stable
   - Lantus 18qhs
   - humalog SSI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute-on-chronic CHF: The patient's worsening heart function and fluid overload increase the risk of acute-on-chronic CHF exacerbation, leading to further pulmonary edema, hypotension, and respiratory distress.
2. Atrial fibrillation/ventricular ectopy: The patient's AF and ventricular ectopy can worsen his heart failure and increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke.
3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient's CKD can progress further due to the ongoing renal insult from diuresis and poor forward flow. This may lead to an increase in serum creatinine levels and a decline in renal function.
4. Leg ulcers: The patient's leg ulcers are at risk for infection and potential surgical debridement. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started to cover possible bacterial infections.
5. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's known pulmonary hypertension may worsen due to"

   now worsened in setting of diuresis and poor forward flow. Prior to his
   admission in [**9-13**] baseline Cr was 1.7, range seems to have been
   1.5-2.0.  Creatinine is 2.5 this morning.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7036**] dated [**2177-2-24**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient with declining respiratory status and no urine output.
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Plan for intubation and PA catheter
   placement to optimize medications for cardiogenic shock.  Critical care
   time 60 minutes.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2177-2-24**] 16:54 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and multiple comorbidities. The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AF).

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Bleeding: The patient has moderate nasopharyngeal bleeding in the setting of a supratherapeutic partial thromboplastin time (PTT). This may be due to the use of heparin, and there is a slight critical drop in hemoglobin levels.
2. Acute-on-chronic CHF: The patient was being diuresed on the floor but was unable to maintain his pressures. He also has pulmonary hypertension, which may be exacerbating his OSA. The patient's dilated heart and AF may be contributing to his worsening heart failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation/ventricular ectopy: The patient's AF is likely contributing to his worsening HF. Cardioversion is planned when the patient is stable, and the use of amiodarone is mentioned.
4. Leg ulcers: The patient has vascular disease and may require surgical debridement in the future.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of afib.
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF: HF was diagnosed [**9-14**], echo during this
   admission with worsened EF to 25%. This is thought to be [**1-7**]
   arrhythmias. Pt had difficulting with diuresis on the floor due to
   hypotension. Initial cause of HF is unclear, pt had a dilated heart. Pt
   also has pulmonary HTN which may be [**1-7**] his OSA. In prior studies his
   PA systolic pressure was estimated at 60+. Clinically, his exam is more
   c/w right than left heart failure. He likely has some Left heart
   failure, which is contributing to his edema on CXR and small oxygen
   requirment.
   - lasix gtt for now, titrate to UO 100/hr
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue metolazone for now
   - may need milrinone to increase BP if not able to tolerate gtt
   - CV tomorrow (see below)
   - once no longer in afib, would repeat echo to better assess EF
   - strict I's, O's
   - will restart ACE once renal function improves
   - hold BB until HF more stable
   - continue to hold home norvasc
   - continue ASA 81mg
   - place A-line for better BP monitoring
   .
   # Atrial fib/ventricular ectopy: Likely contributing to his worsening
   HF. Pt does appear to tolearte being in afib. Likely will benifit from
   cardioversion. Pt was subtheraputic on his coumadin so will need TEE
   - heparin gtt
   - cont amio
   - NPO at midnight for CV tomorrow, will need to page TEE fellow in AM
   .
   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridment in future. WBC was elevated and temp was lower, so abx were
   brodened from cipro cefepime.
   - will continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood cx results
   - vascular recs regarding possible debridement
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr/GFR was at baseline on admission,
   now worsened in setting of diuresis and poor forward flow. Prior to his
   admission in [**9-13**] baseline Cr was 1.7, range seems to have been
   1.5-2.0.
   - monitor with diuresis
   - renally dose meds
   - will check vanco trough in AM
   - renal recs appreciated
   - may benifit from UF, but will require pressors
   .
   # AMS: had a AMS this AM. [**Month (only) 11**] have been secondary to low BP vs
   infection induced delerium. UA shows possible UTI. Pt had abx adjusted
   this AM. AMS may also be from OSA, however, pt refuses bipap
   - will monitor urine and blood cx
   - continue abx
   .
   # OSA: pt refuses bipap, venous ABG shows CO2 renention. This may
   expain his sleepiness.
   - consider trying a nasal bipap, unsure if pt has tried this type
   .
   # L pleural effusion: Likely transudative in setting of CHF. Small and
   stable on cxr [**2-23**]
   - will monitor
   - if enlarges or pt is febrile, consider a dx tap
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: Pt without current sx. Pt is on 20mg prednisone
   qday (normally Q48 hrs at home).
   - continue steriods for now, while pt is having transient hypotension,
   once improved will change back to home dose
   .
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol is 150 daily
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on increased steriod dose
   .
   # Anemia: likely related to CKD, was on EPO at [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor for now
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: chronic, s/p eval with negative HIT Ab, see last
   d/c summary.
   - will monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose, TSH normal, total T4 low, but
   pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked before or after it was
   started)
   - continue current dose
   - consider rechecking thyroid labs
   .
   # DMII: stable
   - Lantus 18qhs

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) presenting with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute-on-Chronic CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, and his current presentation suggests worsening of the condition due to fluid overload and renal dysfunction.
2. Atrial Fibrillation/Ventricular Ectopy: The patient is likely experiencing AF, which is contributing to his worsening heart failure. There is also evidence of ventricular ectopy.
3. Lower Extremity Ulcers: The patient has multiple ulcers on his lower extremities, which are likely related to his PVD. These ulcers may require debridement and management by a vascular specialist.
4. Acute-on-Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened due to diuresis and poor forward flow. This condition needs close monitoring, and medication dosages may need to be adjusted based on renal function.
5. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient's AMS may be due to low blood pressure, infection-induced delirium, or OSA. Further evaluation"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of afib.
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt noted to have moderate nasopharyngeal bleeding in the
   setting of a supratherapeutic PTT. Noted to have a slight crit drop
   this morning.
   - will pack nasal cavity with gauze
   - call ENT
   - Afrin nasal spray
   - holding heparin gtt
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF: Pt was being diuresed on the floor, but was
   unable to maintain his pressures. Pt had a dilated heart. Pt also has
   pulmonary HTN which may be [**1-7**] his OSA. The thought is that pt
s a/fib
   is contributing to his HF.
   - continue lasix gtt and metolazone to achieve I/O goal of -1to2 L for
   the day
   - may need milrinone to increase BP if not able to tolerate gtt
   - cardioversion when stable
   - will restart ACE once renal function improves
   - hold BB until HF more stable
   - continue ASA 81mg
   - norepi for BP support while on milrinone
   .
   # Atrial fib/ventricular ectopy: Likely contributing to his worsening
   HF. Pt does appear to tolearte being in afib. Likely will benifit from
   cardioversion. Pt was subtheraputic on his coumadin so will need TEE
   - holding heparin gtt in the setting of bleeding (see above)
   - cont amio
   - TEE when clinically stable
   .
   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. WBC was elevated and temp was lower, so abx were
   broadened from Cipro to cefepime.
   - will continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood cx results
   - vascular recs regarding possible debridement
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr/GFR was at baseline on admission,
   now worsened in setting of diuresis and poor forward flow. Prior to his
   admission in [**9-13**] baseline Cr was 1.7, range seems to have been
   1.5-2.0.  Creatinine is 2.5 this morning.
   - monitor with diuresis
   - renally dose meds
   - renal recs appreciated
   .
   .
   # OSA: pt refuses bipap, venous ABG shows CO2 renention. This may
   expain his sleepiness.
   - consider trying a nasal bipap, unsure if pt has tried this type
   .
   # L pleural effusion: Likely transudative in setting of CHF. Small and
   stable on cxr [**2-23**]
   - will monitor
   - if enlarges or pt is febrile, consider a dx tap
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: Pt without current sx. Pt is on 20mg prednisone
   qday (normally Q48 hrs at home).
   - continue steriods for now, while pt is having transient hypotension,
   once improved will change back to home dose
   .
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on increased steroid dose
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: chronic, s/p eval with negative HIT Ab, see last
   d/c summary.
   - will monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose, TSH normal, total T4 low, but
   pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked before or after it was
   started)
   - continue current dose
   - consider rechecking thyroid labs

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and ulcerative colitis. He presents with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has moderate nasopharyngeal bleeding with a supratherapeutic PTT. Measures include packing the nasal cavity with gauze, calling ENT, using Afrin nasal spray, holding heparin, and trending Hct.

2. Acute-on-Chronic CHF: The patient was being diuresed on the floor but was unable to maintain his pressures. He has a dilated heart and pulmonary hypertension, which may be contributing to his OSA. The thought is that the patient's AF is contributing to his HF. Treatment includes continuing lasix and metolazone to achieve an I/O goal of -1 to 2 L for the day, considering milrinone to increase BP if not able to tolerate gtt, cardioversion when stable, restarting ACE once renal function improves, holding beta-blockers until HF is more stable, continuing ASA 81 mg, and using norepinephrine for BP support while"

   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of afib.
   .
   # Bleeding: Pt noted to have moderate nasopharyngeal bleeding in the
   setting of a supratherapeutic PTT. Noted to have a slight crit drop
   this morning.
   - will pack nasal cavity with gauze
   - call ENT
   - Afrin nasal spray
   - holding heparin gtt
   - continue to trend Hct
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF: Pt was being diuresed on the floor, but was
   unable to maintain his pressures. Pt had a dilated heart. Pt also has
   pulmonary HTN which may be [**1-7**] his OSA. The thought is that pt
s a/fib
   is contributing to his HF.
   - continue lasix gtt and metolazone to achieve I/O goal of -1to2 L for
   the day
   - may need milrinone to increase BP if not able to tolerate gtt
   - cardioversion when stable
   - will restart ACE once renal function improves
   - hold BB until HF more stable
   - continue ASA 81mg
   - norepi for BP support while on milrinone
   .
   # Atrial fib/ventricular ectopy: Likely contributing to his worsening
   HF. Pt does appear to tolearte being in afib. Likely will benifit from
   cardioversion. Pt was subtheraputic on his coumadin so will need TEE
   - holding heparin gtt in the setting of bleeding (see above)
   - cont amio
   - TEE when clinically stable
   .
   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. WBC was elevated and temp was lower, so abx were
   broadened from Cipro to cefepime.
   - will continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood cx results
   - vascular recs regarding possible debridement
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr/GFR was at baseline on admission,
   now worsened in setting of diuresis and poor forward flow. Prior to his
   admission in [**9-13**] baseline Cr was 1.7, range seems to have been
   1.5-2.0.  Creatinine is 2.5 this morning.
   - monitor with diuresis
   - renally dose meds
   - renal recs appreciated
   .
   .
   # OSA: pt refuses bipap, venous ABG shows CO2 renention. This may
   expain his sleepiness.
   - consider trying a nasal bipap, unsure if pt has tried this type
   .
   # L pleural effusion: Likely transudative in setting of CHF. Small and
   stable on cxr [**2-23**]
   - will monitor
   - if enlarges or pt is febrile, consider a dx tap
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: Pt without current sx. Pt is on 20mg prednisone
   qday (normally Q48 hrs at home).
   - continue steriods for now, while pt is having transient hypotension,
   once improved will change back to home dose
   .
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on increased steroid dose
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: chronic, s/p eval with negative HIT Ab, see last
   d/c summary.
   - will monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose, TSH normal, total T4 low, but
   pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked before or after it was
   started)
   - continue current dose
   - consider rechecking thyroid labs
   .
   # DMII: stable
   - Lantus 18qhs
   - humalog SSI

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and ulcerative colitis. He was admitted with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure.

The patient experienced a nasopharyngeal bleed, which was likely due to a supratherapeutic prothrombin time (PTT). Heparin was held, and the nasal cavity was packed with gauze. ENT consultation was called, and afrin nasal spray was given.

The patient's heart failure was managed with diuretics (Lasix and metolazone) to achieve an adequate output goal. Milrinone was considered to increase blood pressure if needed. Cardioversion was planned when the patient became more stable, and ACE inhibitor therapy was restarted once renal function improved. Beta-blocker therapy was held until heart failure was more stable.

Atrial fibrillation/ventricular ectopy was present, and cardioversion was considered to benefit the patient. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) was subtherapeutic, so a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was planned.

   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of afib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypotension: The patient developed hypotension overnight and is now
   on pressors. He also received aggressive fluid resuscitation overnight.
   There are several possible etiologies for the patient
s hypotension.
   First, he could be septic. He does have a leukocytosis; however, he
   does not have a fever or positive blood cultures at this point.
   Additionally, the patient
s hypotension could be due to poor forward
   flow in the setting of his heart failure.
   - will add a second pressor (vasopressin) at this time, as pt is still
   hypotensive on max levophed
   - need to insert a Swan catheter to obtain more information re: the
   patient
s hemodynamics
   - starting stress dose steroids, as pt is on steroids at home
   - cardioversion needed to obtain better cardiac output (see below)
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely related to his heart failure, complicated
   by poor forward flow from his atrial fibrillation. Additionally, when
   he was intubated, a large clot was suctioned out. Therefore, he could
   have some additional blood clot in his lungs, contributing to his
   respiratory failure.
   - bronchoscopy to look for any additional clot in the pt
s lungs
   - cardioversion as above
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF: As above, the patient
s HF is likely
   contributing to his respiratory failure. Additionally, his atrial
   fibrillation is likely resulting in poor forward flow / poor cardiac
   output. Lasix, milrinone, diuril yesterday did not result in any
   increased in UOP.
   - hold off on further diuresis at this point, considering pt may be
   septic
   - cardioversion today to try to get a sinus rhythm
   - will restart ACE once renal function improves
   - hold BB until HF more stable
   - continue ASA 81mg
   .
   # Atrial fib/ventricular ectopy: Likely contributing to his worsening
   HF. Pt does appear to tolearte being in afib. Likely will benifit from
   cardioversion as above.
   - TEE and then cardioversion
   - cont amio
   - restarting heparin gtt while subtherapeutic on INR
   .
   # Bleeding: Resolved with Afrin and pressure.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. WBC was elevated and temp was lower, so abx were
   broadened from Cipro to cefepime.
   - will continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood cx results
   - vascular recs regarding possible debridement
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr/GFR was at baseline on admission,
   now worsened in setting of diuresis and poor forward flow. Prior to his
   admission in [**9-13**] baseline Cr was 1.7, range seems to have been
   1.5-2.0.  Creatinine is 2.9 this morning. Renal considering placing
   temp HD line and performing HD without fluid removal.
   - monitor with diuresis
   - renally dose meds
   - renal recs appreciated

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD). He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation. Overnight, he developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and hypotension requiring pressors. Possible etiologies for his hypotension include sepsis, poor forward flow due to heart failure, or blood clot in the lungs. He also has a large pleural effusion, multiple leg ulcers, and a history of ulcerative colitis, tophaceous gout, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, and DMII.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis, poor forward flow in heart failure, or blood clot in the lungs. Further evaluation and treatment are needed, including the insertion of a Swan catheter to obtain more information on hemodynamics.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be related to his heart failure, complicated by poor forward flow from atrial fibrillation. Additionally, during intubation, a large clot was suctioned out, indicating the possibility of additional blood clot in the lungs. A bronchoscopy should be considered"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and multiple leg ulcers. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure, in addition to respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient also has atrial fibrillation (AFib) and a dilated heart. He is currently on multiple medications including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, aspirin, and statins. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, bleeding, acute-on-chronic CHF, AFib, and chronic renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient developed hypotension overnight, which could be due to sepsis, bleeding, or acute-on-chronic CHF. Pressors have been started, and additional measures such as vasopressin may be considered.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a moderate nasopharyngeal bleeding in the setting of a supratherapeutic PTT. This may be related to anticoagulation therapy. Gauze packing, ENT consultation, and stopping heparin have been initiated.
3. Acute-on-Chronic CHF: The patient's dilated heart and pulmonary hypertension suggest that he may have acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of afib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension requiring pressors.
   .
   # Hypotension: The patient developed hypotension overnight and is now
   on pressors. He also received aggressive fluid resuscitation overnight.
   There are several possible etiologies for the patient
s hypotension.
   First, he could be septic. He does have a leukocytosis; however, he
   does not have a fever or positive blood cultures at this point.
   Additionally, the patient
s hypotension could be due to poor forward
   flow in the setting of his heart failure.
   - will add a second pressor (vasopressin) at this time, as pt is still
   hypotensive on max levophed
   - need to insert a Swan catheter to obtain more information re: the
   patient
s hemodynamics
   - starting stress dose steroids, as pt is on steroids at home
   - cardioversion needed to obtain better cardiac output (see below)
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely related to his heart failure, complicated
   by poor forward flow from his atrial fibrillation. Additionally, when
   he was intubated, a large clot was suctioned out. Therefore, he could
   have some additional blood clot in his lungs, contributing to his
   respiratory failure.
   - bronchoscopy to look for any additional clot in the pt
s lungs
   - cardioversion as above
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF: As above, the patient
s HF is likely
   contributing to his respiratory failure. Additionally, his atrial
   fibrillation is likely resulting in poor forward flow / poor cardiac
   output. Lasix, milrinone, diuril yesterday did not result in any
   increased in UOP.
   - hold off on further diuresis at this point, considering pt may be
   septic
   - cardioversion today to try to get a sinus rhythm
   - will restart ACE once renal function improves
   - hold BB until HF more stable
   - continue ASA 81mg
   .
   # Atrial fib/ventricular ectopy: Likely contributing to his worsening
   HF. Pt does appear to tolearte being in afib. Likely will benifit from
   cardioversion as above.
   - TEE and then cardioversion
   - cont amio
   - restarting heparin gtt while subtherapeutic on INR
   .
   # Bleeding: Resolved with Afrin and pressure.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. WBC was elevated and temp was lower, so abx were
   broadened from Cipro to cefepime.
   - will continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood cx results
   - vascular recs regarding possible debridement
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr/GFR was at baseline on admission,
   now worsened in setting of diuresis and poor forward flow. Prior to his
   admission in [**9-13**] baseline Cr was 1.7, range seems to have been
   1.5-2.0.  Creatinine is 2.9 this morning. Renal considering placing
   temp HD line and performing HD without fluid removal.
   - monitor with diuresis
   - renally dose meds
   - renal recs appreciated
   .
   # OSA:
   - intubated at this time
   .
   # L pleural effusion: Likely transudative in setting of CHF. Small and
   stable on cxr [**2-23**]
   - will monitor
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: Pt without current sx. Pt is on 20mg prednisone
   qday (normally Q48 hrs at home).
   - stress dose steroids as above
   .
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - stress dose steroids as above
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: chronic, s/p eval with negative HIT Ab, see last
   d/c summary.
   - will monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose, TSH normal, total T4 low, but
   pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked before or after it was
   started)
   - continue current dose
   - consider rechecking thyroid labs
   .
   # DMII: stable

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7036**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Patient quite unstable today with respiratory failure and need for high
   dose Norepi and vasopressin to support BP.
   TEE shows no evidence of atrial thrombus so I proceeded with DC CV
   today with return of NSR with frequent VPCs.
   Bronchoscopy also done today after recent significant epistaxis.
   Continues on high 80% FiO2.  BUN 126 Cr 2.9.
   On triple antibiotics.
   Physical Examination
   intubated sedated
   Medical Decision Making
   Remains very unstable.
   Will consider swan to better assess fluid status after > 2L given over
   past 24 hrs to support BP.
   Covered for sepsis but suspect cardiogenic factors in shock.
   Will try to maintain NSR.   Already on Amio.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient developed hypotension overnight and is now on pressors. He also received aggressive fluid resuscitation overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis or poor forward flow in the setting of his heart failure. The patient is already on maximum doses of levophed and vasopressin, and a Swan-Ganz catheter is needed to obtain more information about the patient's hemodynamics.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to his heart failure, complicated by poor forward flow from AF. Additionally, when he was intubated, a large clot was suctioned out, which could contribute to his respiratory failure.
3. Acute-on-Chronic CHF: The patient's CHF is likely contributing to his respiratory failure. Diuretics did not result in any increase in urine output. Lasix, milrinone, and diurel yesterday did not result in any increased in UOP.
4. Atrial Fib/Ventricular ectopy: The"

The patient presented with symptoms of respiratory distress and hypercarbia, leading to endotracheal intubation. He also had an episode of epistaxis, for which a patch was placed on the nasal septum. The patient required increasing doses of norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure and experienced tachycardia. A unit of packed red blood cells was transfused to improve hemodynamics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation and increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure can progress to chronic renal failure, leading to worsening kidney function and the need for renal replacement therapy such as dialysis.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of heart failure and the use of vasoactive agents like norepinephrine may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
4. Infection: Prolonged immobility and invasive lines increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and cath"

   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypotension: Currently on 0.08 norepinephrine + stable vasopressin
   with MAPS ranging 46-75. Has EF 25%,CVP increased from 6 y/d to 18
   today in the setting of transfusiong 3U today, with pt almost 7L
   positive LOS. Clinically edematous, all consistent with volume overload
   and poor forward flow as etiology. [**Month (only) 11**] be some contribution to
   hypotension from sedating medications. Also started on high dose
   steroids y/d given suspicion for suppressed adrenal axis in setting of
   chronic steroid use. Does have widened pulse pressure, low diastolics,
   less consistent with cardiogenic shock. [**Month (only) 11**] also be hypovolemic from
   blood loss. CXR could not exclude PNA, however had unremarkable bronch,
   but arguing against sepsis is that he has been afebrile, continues to
   have an elevated (but down trending WBC)and Blood, urine, stool,
   bronchial washings NGTD for infectious source/sepsis.
   -would consider swaning,better handle on hemodynamics. Difficulty of
   swan is that she has large IV, can reinitiate IV.
   -Defer HD for now, may be able to improve renal function by optimizing
   forward flow
   -wean off pressors if possible.
   -strict ins/outs
   -goal even to negative 500cc
   -? wean high dose steroids.
   -continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyll.

   Rythm: EF on echo had worsened from 40-55% to 25% which was attibuted
   to his ectopy. He is now s/p cardioversion for a-flutter y/d with
   improved perfusion as indicated by improving BUN/CR. Pt continues to be
   in sinus rythm with some ectopy/tachycardia, with possible contribution
   from leovphed. Was on heparin bridge to coumadin however
   supratherapeutic PTT at low gtt infusion with spontaneous bleeding from
   broken skin, OP, dark, guaic positive stools, thus heparin held.
   Will continue to hold heparin given possible HD line placement later
   today. s/p HD line placement can restart heparin/bridge to coumadin
   with plan 4 weeks anticoagulation s/p cardioversion.
   [**Name (NI) **] PTT/INR (currently 41.7 /2.2)
   Wean pressors as tolerated
   Continue amnio 400 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Resume ACE once renal function improves, BB once off pressors, BP
   tolerates.
   -continue telemetry

   Coagulopathy/GI bleed: hx Ulcerative colitis, on chronic prednisone
   therapy, currently getting high dose steroids. Last colonoscopy [**2173**],
   no flares in years. Black stools, unstable HCT despite transfusion. Now
   with platelets at 45 this am from [**Age over 90 **] y/d. DD includes DIC, HIT,

   FFP x 2 unit, vitamin K 5, consider platelets. recheck CBC. if needed,
   additional RBC transfusion

   Respiratory Distress: semi elective intubation for airway protection in
   setting of profound epistaxis. Also has persistent pulmonary vascular
   congestion, interstitial edema consistent with heart failure and hx
   pulmonary HTN and opacities that were equivocal for
   atelectasis vs infection vs aspiration. Barriers to extubation:
   sedation (fentanyl, versed), requires further procedurization easier
   performed while intubated.
   .
   Acute on chronic renal failure:
   Renal failure improved likely [**1-7**] to improved forward flow with
   conversion to sinus.Does have none gap metabolic acidosis likely
   secondary to renal failure, unable to make adequate ammonia to excrete
   acid. [**Month (only) 11**] consider bicarb in future if continues to [**Month (only) 1174**] down.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) presenting with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of a fibrillating heart. 

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has been treated with various medications including fentanyl, versed, vasopressin, norepinephrine, and steroids. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension requiring pressors, an elevated white blood cell count, and evidence of bleeding.

The assessment and plan include management of diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is also at risk for sepsis, coagulopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen, and a central venous pressure (C"

   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypotension: Currently on 0.08 norepinephrine + stable vasopressin
   with MAPS ranging 46-75. Has EF 25%,CVP increased from 6 y/d to 18
   today in the setting of transfusiong 3U today, with pt almost 7L
   positive LOS. Clinically edematous, all consistent with volume overload
   and poor forward flow as etiology. [**Month (only) 11**] be some contribution to
   hypotension from sedating medications. Also started on high dose
   steroids y/d given suspicion for suppressed adrenal axis in setting of
   chronic steroid use. Does have widened pulse pressure, low diastolics,
   less consistent with cardiogenic shock. [**Month (only) 11**] also be hypovolemic from
   blood loss. CXR could not exclude PNA, however had unremarkable bronch,
   but arguing against sepsis is that he has been afebrile, continues to
   have an elevated (but down trending WBC)and Blood, urine, stool,
   bronchial washings NGTD for infectious source/sepsis.
   -would consider swaning,better handle on hemodynamics. Difficulty of
   swan is that she has large IV, can reinitiate IV.
   -Defer HD for now, may be able to improve renal function by optimizing
   forward flow
   -wean off pressors if possible.
   -strict ins/outs
   -goal even to negative 500cc
   -? wean high dose steroids.
   -continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyll.
   .
   Rythm: EF on echo had worsened from 40-55% to 25% which was attibuted
   to his ectopy. He is now s/p cardioversion for a-flutter y/d with
   improved perfusion as indicated by improving BUN/CR. Pt continues to be
   in sinus rythm with some ectopy/tachycardia, with possible contribution
   from leovphed. Was on heparin bridge to coumadin however
   supratherapeutic PTT at low gtt infusion with spontaneous bleeding from
   broken skin, OP, dark, guaic positive stools, thus heparin held.
   Will continue to hold heparin given possible HD line placement later
   today. s/p HD line placement can restart heparin/bridge to coumadin
   with plan 4 weeks anticoagulation s/p cardioversion.
   [**Name (NI) **] PTT/INR (currently 41.7 /2.2)
   Wean pressors as tolerated
   Continue amnio 400 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Resume ACE once renal function improves, BB once off pressors, BP
   tolerates.
   -continue telemetry
   .
   Coagulopathy/GI bleed: hx Ulcerative colitis, on chronic prednisone
   therapy, currently getting high dose steroids. Last colonoscopy [**2173**],
   no flares in years. Black stools, unstable HCT despite transfusion. Now
   with platelets at 45 this am from [**Age over 90 **] y/d. DD includes DIC, HIT,
   hemolysis. Hemolysis labs negative.
   f/u DIC labs, f/u peripheral smear, consider sending HIT labs (has been
   thrombocytopenic in past this hospitalization)
   -GI consulted ? scope.
   FFP x 2 unit, vitamin K 5, consider platelets. recheck CBC. if needed,
   additional RBC transfusion
   TID crits
   .
   Respiratory Distress: semi elective intubation for airway protection in
   setting of profound epistaxis. Also has persistent pulmonary vascular
   congestion, interstitial edema consistent with heart failure and hx
   pulmonary HTN and opacities that were equivocal for
   atelectasis vs infection vs aspiration. Barriers to extubation:
   sedation (fentanyl, versed), requires further procedurization easier
   performed while intubated.
   .
   Acute on chronic renal failure:
   Renal failure improved likely [**1-7**] to improved forward flow with
   conversion to sinus.Does have none gap metabolic acidosis likely
   secondary to renal failure, unable to make adequate ammonia to excrete
   acid. [**Month (only) 11**] consider bicarb in future if continues to [**Month (only) 1174**] down.
   -continue to optimize hemodynamics, consider swan.
   -[**Month (only) 1174**] lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -defer HD line for now
   -appreciate renal recs.
   .
   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. WBC was elevated and temp was lower, so abx were
   broadened from Cipro to cefepime.
   - will continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl for now
   - f/u blood cx results
   - vascular recs regarding possible debridement
   .
   # OSA:
   - intubated at this time
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - stress dose steroids as above
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: chronic, s/p eval with negative HIT Ab, see last
   d/c summary.
   - will monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose, TSH normal, total T4 low, but
   pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked before or after it was

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic kidney disease (CKD), type II diabetes mellitus (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and multiple ulcerations. The patient presented with massive fluid overload, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring intubation.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, rhythm disturbances (efficiency of 25%), impaired skin integrity, and coagulopathy with gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is also on high-dose steroids due to suspicion of suppressed adrenal axis.

The assessment and plan include strict ins and outs, goal even to negative 500cc, weaning off pressors if possible, and continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. The patient's coagulopathy/gi bleed is attributed to ulcerative colitis, chronic prednisone therapy, and high-dose steroids. The patient's renal function is being optimized, and the plan is to restart ACE inhibitors once renal function improves, beta-blockers once off pressors, and continue amnio 400.

The patient's respiratory distress is due to profound epistaxis, pulmonary vascular congestion, interstitial edema consistent with heart failure, and a history of pulmonary hypertension and opacities. The patient is semi-elective for int"

   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of afib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypotension: Currently on 0.08 norepinephrine + stable vasopressin
   with MAPS ranging 46-75. Has EF 25%,CVP increased from 6 y/d to 18
   today in the setting of transfusiong 3U today, with pt almost 7L
   positive LOS. Clinically edematous, all consistent with volume overload
   and poor forward flow as etiology. [**Month (only) 11**] be some contribution to
   hypotension from sedating medications. Also started on high dose
   steroids y/d given suspicion for suppressed adrenal axis in setting of
   chronic steroid use. Does have widened pulse pressure, low diastolics,
   less consistent with cardiogenic shock. CXR could not exclude PNA,
   however had unremarkable bronch, but arguing against sepsis is that he
   has been afebrile, continues to have an elevated (but down trending
   WBC)and Blood, urine, stool, bronchial washings NGTD for infectious
   source/sepsis.
   -would consider swaning,better handle on hemodynamics.
   -Defer HD for now, may be able to improve renal function by optimizing
   cards.
   -wean off pressors if possible.
   -gently reinitiate diuresis.
   -possible HD line today/HD
   -strict ins/outs
   -goal even to negative 500cc
   -? wean high dose steroids.
   -continue broad spectrum abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyll?
   .
   Rythm: EF on echo had worsened from 40-55% to 25% which was attibuted
   to his ectopy. He is now s/p cardioversion for a-flutter y/d with
   improved perfusion as indicated by improving BUN/CR. Pt continues to be
   in sinus rythm with some ectopy/tachycardia, with possible contribution
   from leovphed. Was on heparin bridge to coumadin however
   supratherapeutic PTT at low gtt infusion with spontaneous bleeding from
   broken skin, OP, dark, guaic positive stools, thus heparin held.
   Will continue to hold heparin given possible HD line placement later
   today. s/p HD line placement can restart heparin/bridge to coumadin
   with plan 4 weeks anticoagulation s/p cardioversion.
   [**Name (NI) **] PTT/INR (currently 41.7 /2.2)
   Wean pressors as tolerated
   Continue amnio 400 [**Hospital1 **]
   -Resume ACE once renal function improves, BB once off pressors, BP
   tolerates.
   -continue telemetry
   .
   Coagulopathy/GI bleed: hx Ulcerative colitis, on chronic prednisone
   therapy, currently getting high dose steroids. Last colonoscopy [**2173**],
   no flares in years. Black stools, unstable HCT despite transfusion. Now
   with platelets at 45 this am from [**Age over 90 **] y/d. DD includes DIC, HIT,
   hemolysis. Hemolysis labs negative.
   f/u DIC labs, f/u peripheral smear, consider sending HIT labs (has been
   thrombocytopenic in past this hospitalization)
   -GI consulted ? scope.
   FFP x 1 unit, recheck CBC. Consider Vit K if needed, additional RBC
   transfusion
   TID crits
   .
   Respiratory Distress: semi elective intubation for airway protection in
   setting of profound epistaxis. Also has persistent pulmonary vascular
   congestion, interstitial edema consistent with heart failure and hx
   pulmonary HTN and opacities that were equivocal for
   atelectasis vs infection vs aspiration. Barriers to extubation:
   sedation (fentanyl, versed), requires further procedurization easier
   performed while intubated.
   .
   Acute on chronic renal failure:
   Renal failure improved likely [**1-7**] to improved forward flow with
   conversion to sinus.Does have none gap metabolic acidosis likely
   secondary to renal failure, unable to make adequate ammonia to excrete
   acid. [**Month (only) 11**] consider bicarb in future if continues to [**Month (only) 1174**] down.
   -continue to optimize hemodynamics, consider swan.
   -[**Month (only) 1174**] lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -defer HD line for now

   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. WBC was elevated and temp was lower, so abx were

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and ulcerative colitis. The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, requiring pressors for hypotension and vasopressin for fluid balance.

The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has worsened from 40-55% to 25%, indicating severely depressed biventricular systolic function. He also has mild mitral regurgitation, mild aortic stenosis, and complex atheroma in the descending aorta and aortic arch. These findings are consistent with his known history of heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, leading to respiratory failure. He has profound epistaxis, which necessitated semi-elective intubation for airway protection. His pulmonary vascular congestion, interstitial edema, and opacities on chest X-ray raise concerns for pulmonary edema and possible infection or aspiration. 

The patient's renal function has been improving with optimized hemodynamics and conversion to sinus rhythm. However, he still has none-gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to renal failure. 

Coagulopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding are also concerns, given the patient's history"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, renal failure (both acute and chronic), and impaired skin integrity. The patient presented with massive fluid overload, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring intubation. He also had hypotension that was initially thought to be due to hypovolemia but is now believed to be cardiogenic or distributive shock. The patient has evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray and clinically, but there are also findings concerning for pneumonia. The patient has a yeast bacteremia, and his primary pulmonary process is ongoing. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, including micafungin.

The patient also has a coagulopathy, with a history of ulcerative colitis and chronic prednisone therapy. He is currently receiving high-dose steroids, and his platelet count is low. Differential diagnoses include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and hemolysis. Hemolysis labs are negative, and HIT/ADAMTS13 is negative in the past. The patient has a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

The patient's acute-on-chronic renal failure has improved likely due to improved forward flow"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. Currently, he is in respiratory failure after intubation, requiring pressors for hypotension, and has a suspected pulmonary embolism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently on a combination of norepinephrine and vasopressin to maintain blood pressure, indicating ongoing hypotension. The MAP ranges from 46-75, which is below the normal range of 75-90 mmHg.
2. Coagulopathy/GI bleed: The patient has black stools, unstable hematocrit despite transfusion, and thrombocytopenia. There is a concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), or hemolysis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient is semi-elective intubated for airway protection due to profound epistaxis. He also has persistent pulmonary vascular congestion, interstitial edema consistent with heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. These factors increase the risk"

The patient has black stools, unstable hematocrit, and thrombocytopenia. His rhythm has improved, but his renal function remains poor. He has diffuse tophi on exam and a history of thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy/GI bleed: The patient has black stools, unstable hematocrit, and thrombocytopenia. These findings suggest a possible gastrointestinal bleed. Further evaluation with GI consultation and stool analysis is needed. FFP, vitamin K, and platelet transfusion may be considered if necessary.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient has profound epistaxis and persistent pulmonary vascular congestion. Intubation was performed for airway protection and to improve oxygenation. Weaning off pressors and extubation will depend on the patient's clinical stability.
3. Acute-on-chronic renal failure: The patient"

   - got 5 mg IV vit K with reversal of his coagulopathy
   Held anticoagulants, started IV PPI.
   - decreased vanc dosing to q48 hours
   - put in wound care consult for sacral wound
   - hematocrit relatively stable
   - GI feels that pt's melanotic stools and blood in NGT are likely
   related to recent epistaxis; recommend trending Hct and transfusing
   PRN; also feel that thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction in
   setting of renal failure are likely contributors; emergent EGD if

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, renal failure (acute on chronic), respiratory failure (acute), epistaxis, impaired skin integrity, chronic kidney disease, and peripheral vascular disease. He presents with massive fluid overload, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring intubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to hypovolemia or cardiogenic/distributive shock. Volume overload on CXR and clinical findings suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is on chronic prednisone therapy. He is currently receiving high-dose steroids, and his platelet count is low. Differential diagnosis includes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and hemolysis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

3. Yeast Bacteremia: The patient has evidence of yeast bacteremia, which requires broadening antibiotics to include micafungin. The primary pulmonary process is ongoing, and he is not a candidate for extubation at present.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and multiple ulcerations. He presents with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. The patient is now in respiratory failure following intubation and requires pressor support for hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially experienced hypotension that was initially thought to be due to hypovolemia from bleeding, but later found to be unrelated to GI bleeding or epistaxis. The cause of hypotension is still under investigation, with possible cardiogenic or distributive shock. The patient has evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray and clinically, but also has findings concerning for pneumonia.

2. Yeast Bacteremia: The patient has evidence of a primary pulmonary process with yeast identified in BAL fluid and now has yeast bacteremia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, including micafungin, and the patient's lines have been resited. An Infectious Disease consult has been requested.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, on chronic prednisone therapy, and currently receiving high-dose steroids. He has black stools, unstable hematocrit despite transfusion, and now presents with thromboc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, renal failure (acute and chronic), respiratory failure (acute), epistaxis, impaired skin integrity, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. Currently, the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with hypotension requiring vasopressors. The patient has metabolic acidosis, hypoxemia, and shock/heart failure. The patient's lactate levels are trending down.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a pH of 7.28 to 7.30, indicating metabolic acidosis. The anion gap is relatively stable at 12 to 14, and lactate levels are not elevated. However, the cause of the metabolic acidosis is unclear.

2. Infection: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast bacteremia, most likely originating from a central line infection. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and micafungin.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient had an elevated INR of 26.4 but has improved with treatment. Monitoring of CBC, INR, and PTT is recommended.

   - pH 7.28 to 7.30 on serial ABGs, metabolic acidosis remained stable
   throughout day; anion gap 12 to 14, relatively stable; lactate not
   elevated, renal fxn improving, thus no clear cause for AG metabolic
   acidosis
   - white count elevated to 15.8 from 9, presumed secondary to steroids
   - seen by vascular service, legs examined, not felt to be infected;
   recommended for elevation and ACE compression wraps; no surgical
   intervention
   - renal recommended for holding off diuresis, maintaining CVP 20-25
   - in afternoon, attempted diuresis with Lasix gtt and one-time dose of
   metolazone 5; UOP did not increase but remained around 20 to 30 cc per

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease presenting with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. He is now in respiratory failure post-intubation and hypotensive requiring pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has persistent metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.28-7.30. The anion gap is relatively stable at 12-14, and lactate levels are not elevated. The cause of the metabolic acidosis is unclear despite improving renal function.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive requiring pressors. The hypotension is multifactorial, including hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood), and cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). It has improved with resolution of bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm.

3. Yeast Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast, suggesting yeast bacteremia. The most likely source is the central line, which has been resited. Goal CVP 20-24.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient had an improved coagulopathy with an INR now at 1.8. CBC, INR,"

   24 Hour Events:
   - pH 7.28 to 7.30 on serial ABGs, metabolic acidosis remained stable
   throughout day; anion gap 12 to 14, relatively stable; lactate not
   elevated, renal fxn improving, thus no clear cause for AG metabolic
   acidosis
   - white count elevated to 15.8 from 9, presumed secondary to steroids
   - seen by vascular service, legs examined, not felt to be infected;
   recommended for elevation and ACE compression wraps; no surgical
   intervention
   - renal recommended for holding off diuresis, maintaining CVP 20-25
   - in afternoon, attempted diuresis with Lasix gtt and one-time dose of
   metolazone 5; UOP did not increase but remained around 20 to 30 cc per
   hour; CVP meanwhile decreased to [**10-18**] and thus Lasix drip was stopped

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, renal failure (acute on chronic), respiratory failure (acute), epistaxis, impaired skin integrity, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension requiring pressors, yeast bacteremia likely from a central line infection, coagulopathy, and LE ulcers. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be maintained.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has yeast bacteremia likely originating from a central line infection. Proper care and maintenance of central lines, along with appropriate antibiotic therapy, should be continued to prevent further complications.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and other factors increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, renal failure (acute and chronic), respiratory failure (acute), epistaxis, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and has a known history of atrial fibrillation and chronic renal failure.

The patient's 24-hour events include a stable metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 12 to 14. The lactate level is not elevated, and renal function is improving, but the cause of the anion gap metabolic acidosis is unclear. The patient's white blood cell count has increased to 15.8 from 9, which is presumed to be secondary to steroids. There are no signs of infection in the legs, and the vascular service recommends elevation and ACE compression wraps but no surgical intervention. The renal team suggests holding off diuresis and maintaining CVP between 20-25. In the afternoon, an attempt was made to diuresis with Lasix and metolazone, but the urine output did not increase, and the CVP decreased to 10-18, so the Lasix drip was stopped around 10 PM. The heparin drip has been held for at least one week per Dr. [Last Name (Title)].

- Metronidazole - [2177-3-1] 12:00 AM

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a stable metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 12 to 14. The cause is not clear, and it needs further investigation to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

2. Elevated white blood cell count: The patient's white blood cell count has increased to 15.8 from 9, which is presumed to be secondary to steroids. This increase in white blood cell count should be monitored closely for any signs of infection or other complications.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or infections. Close monitoring and appropriate skin care measures should be implemented to prevent further complications.

4. Renal function: The patient has both acute and chronic renal failure. Monitoring the renal function and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly is important to prevent further deterioration.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient is in the ICU for acute respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including bacteremia, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure (diastolic), acute on chronic, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), epistaxis (nosebleed), impaired skin integrity, and chronic renal failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has bacteremia, which indicates an ongoing infection. There is a risk of the infection spreading and leading to sepsis or septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure. If not properly managed, this could progress to respiratory arrest or ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
3. Renal Failure: The patient has both acute and chronic renal failure. Improper management of renal function could lead to worsening kidney function and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has heart failure and atrial fibrillation. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, fluid overload, and cardiac arrest.
5. Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to ulcers and stasis dermatitis. Poor wound care management can increase the risk of infection and delayed healing.
6. Glycemic Control: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus. Poor glycemic control can lead to hyperglycemia or"

   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Hypotension: Multiple possible etiologies, including hypovolemia
   (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood), cardiogenic
   (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of bleeding and
   cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily cardiogenic in nature.
   Currently on low-dose norepi. Yesterday, pressor was weaned off;
   however, after, pt
s UOP was noted to trend down and pressor was
   restarted.
   -continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, plus micafungin
   -attempt to wean pressors
   -goal CVP in upper teens to low 20
s, as that is when pt seems to have
   better UOP
   -consider giving colloid with Lasix to improve diuresis
   .
   # Volume Overload: Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting
   of pt
s heart failure. As above, pt had improved UOP yesterday in the
   setting of a slightly higher CVP, after receiving blood and albumin.
   However, pressors were weaned down and UOP dropped off. Now, pt back on
   norepi.
   - consider giving blood/albumin, followed by Lasix to see if this will
   improve UOP
   - can also consider inotrope this evening if urine output does not
   improve
   - possible trial of CVVH tomorrow, will d/w renal

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) presenting with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of a fibrotic disease. The patient is currently in respiratory failure following intubation and requires pressors for hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (yeast in blood), or cardiogenic (CHF) causes. The hypotension has improved with resolution of bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. However, it is likely primarily cardiogenic in nature. The patient is currently on a low dose of norepinephrine (norepi).

2. Volume Overload: The patient is likely experiencing volume overload due to poor forward flow in the setting of heart failure. The patient had improved urine output (UOP) yesterday with a slightly higher central venous pressure (CVP) after receiving blood and albumin. However, the pressors were weaned down, leading to a decrease in UOP. The patient is now back on norepi.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical conditions and complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection as indicated by the positive stool culture. This increases the risk of sepsis and systemic infection.

2. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Poor glycemic control can lead to various complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid hormone levels may be imbalanced, leading to symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Untreated hypothyroidism can result in myxedema coma, a life-threatening condition.

4. Ulcerative Colitis: The patient's gastrointestinal condition involves inflammation and ulcers in the colon. Complications include severe bleeding, perforation, and increased risk of infections.

5. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient has impaired cardiac function, which may worsen over time if not properly managed. This can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock.

6. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of irregular heart rhythm, which increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart palpitations.

7. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient's kidneys are"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) presenting with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. The patient is currently intubated and in respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. He has hypotension requiring vasopressors, metabolic acidosis, hypoxemia, and infection. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including hypovolemia, distributive (yeast in blood), and cardiogenic causes (CHF, ectopy). It has improved with resolution of bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm, but he remains on low-dose norepinephrine plus vasopressin.
2. Yeast bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture indicating yeast bacteremia, most likely from a central line. The goal CVP is 20-24, and he should continue on micafungin, follow ID recommendations, and evaluate micro data.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile has improved, with an INR now at 1.8. Trend CBC, INR, and PTT.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely prerenal and has improved with better forward flow. Follow renal recommendations, trend electrolytes, and consult nephrology.
5. Lower extremity ulcers: The patient has vascular involvement with leg ulcers. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical debridement in the future. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, follow blood culture results, consult podiatry, and consider no debridement needed at this time.
6. Tophaceous gout: The patient has diffuse tophi on exam. Continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol, holding home colchicine for now.
7. Ulcerative colitis: The patient is on chronic steroids. Stress dose steroids in setting of critical illness.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient is continuing home dose of levothyroxine, TSH normal, total T4 low. Continue current dose, unsure if level was checked before or after starting amiodarone.

Overall, the patient is in a critical condition with multiple medical complications requiring close monitoring and management."

   INDICATION: Pneumonia and heart failure.
   FINDINGS: Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position.
   Cardiac
   silhouette remains enlarged, and there is persistent congestive heart
   failure.
   More confluent areas of opacity in the right upper and both lower lobes
   probably represent pneumonia, and appear slightly worse in the right
   upper
   lobe and slightly better in the left lower lobe. Moderate right and
   small
   left pleural effusion are unchanged
   ------------
   PORTABLE CHEST [**3-3**]:
   Two films were taken. One prior to and another after trial of reduced
   pressure support. The right lung is white out with the appearance of
   edema. The right lung appears well inflated, the left similar.
   Microbiology: [**Female First Name (un) **] in blood culture from [**2-25**]. No [**Last Name (un) 3587**] yet in
   subsequent, including two mycolytic from [**2-27**] without growth.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. As above, pt had improved UOP yesterday in the setting of a
   slightly higher CVP, after receiving blood and albumin. However,
   pressors were weaned down and UOP dropped off. Norepi  off now.
   - Attempt continued diuresis with Lasix given some progress since
   midnight.
   - Failing diuretic goals, give albumin or blood
   - Failing those products, consider restarting pressors
   - possible trial of CVVH tomorrow, will d/w renal
   # Hypotension: Multiple possible etiologies, including hypovolemia
   (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood), cardiogenic
   (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of bleeding and
   cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily cardiogenic in nature.
   Currently on low-dose norepi. Yesterday, pressor was weaned off;
   however, after, pt
s UOP was noted to trend down and pressor was
   restarted.
   - Septic
 appreciate ID input
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, plus micafungin (likely to fluconazole
   today)
   - goal CVP in upper teens to low 20
s, as that is when pt seems to have
   better UOP, but  this will need to be balanced with overload/diuresis
   (likely can increase CVP as well as facilitate diuresis and treat
   anasarca with albumin/blood)
 see above.
   # Respiratory Faliure
   Per CXR, likely large component of edema given CXR findings after
   reducing pressure support. Inspiratory effort is also poor at present,
   which is unexplained. Obesity and sedation likely contributors. Lung
   compliance in 40s and resistance acceptable. Therefore neuromuscular.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be due to sedation and low bicarb with reduced drive. Needs longer
   trials of weaned pressure and further diuresis.
   # Yeast bacteremia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source is central line
   (now resited).
   -continue micafungin (converting to fluconazole)
   -D/w ID, chance of fungal pneumonia
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   -consult ophtho to evaluate for [**Female First Name (un) **] endophthalmitis
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.2.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   slightly improved overnight in the setting of increased UOP.
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -consider CVVH tomorrow, as above
   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. On broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u blood cx results
   - per vascular no debridement needed.
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - stress dose steroids in setting of critical illness
   - Halve dose of steroids today
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

   TITLE: CCU Attending Progress Note
   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10339**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Remains intubated.  A combination of furosemide and hydrodiuril had
   resulted in 30 cc/hr urine output.
   Renal is not enthusiastic about CVVH in the absence of success with
   diuresis with diuretics.
   Tricuspid regurgitation may remain an impediment to diuresis.
   Medical Decision Making
   Continue antibiotics and antimicrobial
   Consider ionotropic support with IV lasix to improve diuresis.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and severe peripheral vascular disease presenting with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of a fibrotic process. The patient is now in respiratory failure post intubation and has hypotension requiring pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has massive fluid overload likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of heart failure. Continued diuresis with Lasix is attempted, and if diuresis fails, albumin or blood transfusion may be considered.
2. Hypotension: Multiple etiologies for hypotension including hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (yeast in blood), and cardiogenic (CHF, frequent ectopy) are present. The patient is currently on low-dose norepinephrine. Pressor weaning was attempted but had to be restarted due to decreasing urine output.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has inspiratory effort that is poor, unexplained by lung compliance or resistance. Sedation and low bicarbonate levels with reduced respiratory drive may be contributing factors. Further trials of weaned pressure and diuresis are needed.
4. Yeast Bacteremia: A positive blood culture indicates yeast bacteremia, most likely originating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted for ulcer debridement. He has a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, renal failure (acute), respiratory failure (acute), epistaxis, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently in the ICU due to pneumonia and heart failure. He has been experiencing hyperglycemia and has been started on insulin gtt. The patient received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells and attempted diuresis with Lasix and Diuril. If diuresis does not work, CVVH is unlikely to succeed, and inotropic-assisted diuresis could be considered. The patient's tube feeds have been stopped for the night. Allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including vancomycin, micafungin, cefipime, and metronidazole. Infusions include midazolam, fentanyl, furosemide, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's vitals are stable, with a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/61 to 139/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 100%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 127.9 kg, height is 73 inches, and CVP is 15 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,965 mL and total output of 990 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 27. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, HCO3 of 18 mEq/L, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 433. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment not assessed. Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 8.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, glucose of 226 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL, sodium of 128 mg/dL, potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, and chloride of 102 mEq/L. Imaging shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, congestive heart failure, and areas of opacity in the right upper and both lower lobes, suggesting pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, renal failure (acute), respiratory failure (acute),"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and multiple ulcerations. The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation. Currently, the patient is in respiratory failure after intubation and is experiencing hypotension requiring pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to various reasons such as hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood), or cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). The patient's condition improved with the resolution of bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm, but remains primarily cardiogenic in nature. The patient is currently on low-dose norepinephrine, and the pressor was weaned off yesterday but restarted due to declining urine output.

2. Volume Overload: The patient likely has volume overload related to poor forward flow in the setting of heart failure. The patient's urine output improved slightly with a higher central venous pressure (CVP), after receiving blood and albumin. However, when the pressors were weaned down, the urine output dropped off.

   Imaging: PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2177-3-2**]
   COMPARISON: [**2177-3-1**].
   INDICATION: Pneumonia and heart failure.
   FINDINGS: Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position.
   Cardiac
   silhouette remains enlarged, and there is persistent congestive heart
   failure.
   More confluent areas of opacity in the right upper and both lower lobes
   probably represent pneumonia, and appear slightly worse in the right
   upper
   lobe and slightly better in the left lower lobe. Moderate right and
   small
   left pleural effusion are unchanged
   ------------
   PORTABLE CHEST [**3-3**]:
   Two films were taken. One prior to and another after trial of reduced
   pressure support. The right lung is white out with the appearance of
   edema. The right lung appears well inflated, the left similar.
   Microbiology: [**Female First Name (un) **] in blood culture from [**2-25**]. No [**Last Name (un) 3587**] yet in
   subsequent, including two mycolytic from [**2-27**] without growth.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension requiring pressors.
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. As above, pt had improved UOP yesterday in the setting of a
   slightly higher CVP, after receiving blood and albumin. However,
   pressors were weaned down and UOP dropped off. Norepi  off now.
   - Attempt continued diuresis with Lasix given some progress since
   midnight.
   - Failing diuretic goals, give albumin or blood
   - Failing those products, consider restarting pressors
   - possible trial of CVVH tomorrow, will d/w renal
   # Hypotension: Multiple possible etiologies, including hypovolemia
   (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood), cardiogenic
   (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of bleeding and
   cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily cardiogenic in nature.
   Currently on low-dose norepi. Yesterday, pressor was weaned off;
   however, after, pt
s UOP was noted to trend down and pressor was
   restarted.
   - Septic
 appreciate ID input
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, plus micafungin (likely to fluconazole
   today)
   - goal CVP in upper teens to low 20
s, as that is when pt seems to have
   better UOP, but  this will need to be balanced with overload/diuresis
   (likely can increase CVP as well as facilitate diuresis and treat
   anasarca with albumin/blood)
 see above.
   # Respiratory Faliure
   Per CXR, likely large component of edema given CXR findings after
   reducing pressure support. Inspiratory effort is also poor at present,
   which is unexplained. Obesity and sedation likely contributors. Lung
   compliance in 40s and resistance acceptable. Therefore neuromuscular.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be due to sedation and low bicarb with reduced drive. Needs longer
   trials of weaned pressure and further diuresis.
   # Yeast bacteremia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source is central line
   (now resited).
   -continue micafungin (converting to fluconazole)
   -D/w ID, chance of fungal pneumonia
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   -consult ophtho to evaluate for [**Female First Name (un) **] endophthalmitis
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.2.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   slightly improved overnight in the setting of increased UOP.
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -consider CVVH tomorrow, as above
   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. On broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u blood cx results
   - per vascular no debridement needed.
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - stress dose steroids in setting of critical illness
   - Halve dose of steroids today
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

   Disposition:
","The patient's chief complaint is an ulcer debridement, but they were admitted to the ICU for heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and multiple ulcerations. They presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. Now, the patient is in respiratory failure after intubation and has hypotension requiring pressors.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/61 mmHg to 139/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination shows that they are intubated, opening their eyes and nodding to verbal stimuli. They have faint hair scattered on the chest, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated, clear lungs anteriorly, soft non-tender abdomen, and pitting edema in all four extremities. There is also a large ecchymosis present on the right arm.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 8.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, glucose of 226 mg/dL, sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, total bilirubin of 0.9 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL, calcium of 8.3 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.6 mg/dL, and phosphate of 3.5 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures are positive for yeast.

The patient's imaging shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette with persistent congestive heart failure. There are more confluent areas of opacity in the right upper and both lower lobes, representing pneumonia that appears slightly worse in the right upper lobe and slightly better in the left lower lobe. There is also a moderate right and small left pleural effusion.

The patient's assessment and plan include multiple medical complications such as volume overload, hypotension, respiratory failure, yeast bacteremia, coagulopathy, acute-on-chronic renal failure, leg ulcers, tophaceous gout, ulcerative colitis, and hypothyroidism. The patient is on various medications including vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole, pantoprazole, heparin, furosemide, midazolam, fentanyl, and insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, worsening renal function, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and further episodes of hypotension."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history including systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with multiple ulcerations, and a fibrotic condition. The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure secondary to intubation, hypotension off pressors, volume overload, yeast fungemia, coagulopathy, acute-on-chronic renal failure, lower extremity (LE) ulcers, tophaceous gout, ulcerative colitis, hypothyroidism, and a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has signs of fluid overload, as indicated by poor forward flow due to heart failure and decreased urine output. This can lead to further respiratory distress, worsening heart failure, and renal dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be caused by various factors such as hypovolemia, distributive, or cardiogenic causes. Continued monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors including"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) presenting with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. The patient is now in respiratory failure post intubation and has hypotension requiring pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient's massive fluid overload needs to be managed through diuresis, blood transfusions, or albumin administration. If diuretic goals are not achieved, restarting pressors may be necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to various causes, including hypovolemia, distributive, or cardiogenic factors. Pressors have been used to maintain blood pressure, but the patient's urine output dropped after weaning off the pressors.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to several factors, including obesity, sedation, reduced lung compliance, and neuromuscular weakness. Trials of weaned pressure and further diuresis are recommended.
4. Yeast Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast bacteremia, likely originating from the central line. Antibiotic treatment should continue with micafung"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of heart failure and is currently presenting with acute decompensated heart failure. The presence of AFIB is also noted in the medical history.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The ventilator settings indicate that they are receiving supplemental oxygen and have a set respiratory rate.

3. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently experiencing acute renal failure. This is evident from the laboratory results showing elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not explicitly mentioned in the progress note, the elevated blood glucose levels suggest poorly controlled diabetes, which may lead to DKA.

5. Ulcerative colitis: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation and ulcers in the colon and rectum.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, as indicated by the presence of a pressure ulcer.

7. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as medication effects, electrolyte imbalances, or sepsis.

8. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, as evidenced by the positive blood cultures.

   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors.
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. As above, pt had improved UOP in the setting of a slightly
   higher CVP, after receiving blood and albumin. However, pressors were
   weaned down and UOP dropped off. Norepi off now.  Attempted diuresis

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Volume Overload: The patient has signs of fluid overload with high CVP, low urine output, and worsening respiratory failure. This can be due to heart failure and the administration of blood products.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which could be caused by various factors such as hypovolemia, distributive shock, or cardiogenic shock. This may require continuous monitoring and treatment with pressors.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to fluid accumulation in the lungs. Positive pressure ventilation may be required to manage this condition.

4. Yeast Fungemia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast, indicating a possible fungal infection. This needs to be treated with antifungal medications like fluconazole.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient had a coagulopathy indicated by an elevated INR. This may be related to malnutrition or other factors. Monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary, and further anticoagulation may be avoided due to recent bleeding problems.

6. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a need for close monitoring of renal parameters. Consideration should be given to renal replacement therapy, such as continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. As above, pt had improved UOP in the setting of a slightly
   higher CVP, after receiving blood and albumin. Restarted milrinone
   along with IV lasix, no significant improvement in output, still net
   positive.
   - Will discuss with renal possible trial of CVVH
   - Transfuse of 1 unit PRBCs to help maintain CVP in low 20s
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Multiple possible etiologies, including
   hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood),
   cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature.
   - Transfuse per above
   - CVVH per above as ultrafiltration will assist in Frank-Starling
   physiology
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, plus increased fluconazole from 200 mg
   IV Q24H to 400 mg IV Q24H (per ID and pharm)
   - goal CVP in upper teens to low 20
s, as that is when pt seems to have
   better UOP
   - Guiac all stools
   # Respiratory Faliure
   Per CXR, likely large component of edema given CXR findings after
   reducing pressure support. This suggests pt is dependent on positive
   pressure to keep fluid out of lungs. Inspiratory effort is also poor at
   present, which is unexplained. Obesity and sedation likely
   contributors. Lung compliance in 40s and resistance acceptable.
   Therefore neuromuscular. [**Month (only) 11**] be due to sedation and low bicarb with
   reduced drive. Needs longer trials of weaned pressure and further
   diuresis.
   - continue daily weaning trials
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt
   -if no adequate HCT bump consider small dose of vitamin K
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -consider CVVH tomorrow, as above
   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. On broad spectrum antibiotics. Tissue culture
   results yield GPCs in pairs/clusters and GNRs suggesting polymicrobial
   chronic infection.
   - Await speciation/sensitivities
   - ID recs
   - continue vanco/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u blood cx results
   - f/u vascular recs (Do they think this is Osteo or no active signs of
   osteo?)
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - stress dose steroids in setting of critical illness (halved
   yesterday)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation. The patient is now in respiratory failure post-intubation and has hypotension off pressors.

The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix), milrinone, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), fentanyl, and other ICU medications. 

His physical examination reveals that he is intubated and sedated, with obesity and anasarca. He opens his eyes and nods to verbal stimuli appropriately. His heart sounds are faint and no murmurs or gallops are appreciated. His lungs are clear anteriorly, but he has pitting edema in all four extremities and large ecchymosis on his right arm.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose, and potassium. His white blood cell count is slightly elevated. The urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio is 24.0%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates respiratory acidosis.

The patient's imaging shows slightly improved right lung opacities, consistent with pneumonia. Bilateral effusions and a waxing-and-waning pattern suggest"

   contributors. Lung compliance in 40s and resistance acceptable.

- The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD).
- The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis.
- The patient is now in respiratory failure following intubation and has hypotension off pressors.
- The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast, indicating possible candidemia.
- The patient's coagulopathy has improved, with an INR now at 1.4.
- The patient's renal function is stable, with a creatinine level of 2.0.
- The patient has multiple ulcers on the lower extremities, which may be due to peripheral vascular disease.
- The patient has diffuse tophi, suggesting tophaceous gout.
- The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and hypothyroidism.
- The patient's nutritional status is being monitored, and glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Volume overload: The patient has a history of CHF and poor forward flow, leading to fluid accumulation in the body.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced hypot"

","The patient is a 73-year-old male who presented with an ulcer debridement. The patient was admitted to the hospital and later transferred to the ICU due to heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, epistaxis, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 127/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 250, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and platelets (Plt). The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range. The patient's electrolyte levels are also within normal limits. The patient's imaging shows confirmation of dialysis line placement.

The patient's microbiology results indicate the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, along with gram-negative rods. Further identification and sensitivity testing on all organisms is requested.

The patient's current medications include calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, and other ICU medications. The patient's nutrition is being provided through NovaSource Renal (Full) at a rate of 35 mL/hour. The patient's glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient's assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, bacteremia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), renal failure, acute respiratory failure, epistaxis, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic renal failure. The patient's ICU care involves monitoring of vital signs, arterial line, multi-lumen line, and dialysis catheter. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is also being provided.

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. As above, pt had improved UOP in the setting of a slightly
   higher CVP, after receiving blood and albumin. Restarted milrinone
   along with IV lasix, no significant improvement in output, still net
   positive.
   - Will discuss with renal possible trial of CVVH
   - Transfuse of 1 unit PRBCs to help maintain CVP in low 20s
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Multiple possible etiologies, including
   hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood),
   cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature.
   - Transfuse per above
   - CVVH per above as ultrafiltration will assist in Frank-Starling
   physiology
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, plus increased fluconazole from 200 mg
   IV Q24H to 400 mg IV Q24H (per ID and pharm)
   - goal CVP in upper teens to low 20
s, as that is when pt seems to have
   better UOP
   - Guiac all stools
   # Respiratory Faliure
   Per CXR, likely large component of edema given CXR findings after
   reducing pressure support. This suggests pt is dependent on positive
   pressure to keep fluid out of lungs. Inspiratory effort is also poor at
   present, which is unexplained. Obesity and sedation likely
   contributors. Lung compliance in 40s and resistance acceptable.
   Therefore neuromuscular. [**Month (only) 11**] be due to sedation and low bicarb with
   reduced drive. Needs longer trials of weaned pressure and further
   diuresis.
   - continue daily weaning trials
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole

   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt
   -if no adequate HCT bump consider small dose of vitamin K

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus type II. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of a fib. The patient is now in respiratory failure post intubation and has hypotension off pressors.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/55 mmHg to 169/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient has pitting edema in all four extremities and large ecchymosis present on the right arm. He is intubated and sedated, but opens his eyes and nods to verbal stimuli appropriately. He moves all four extremities by verbal command and has pupils that are equal and reactive to light.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal impairment. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium. His liver function tests are normal.

The patient's imaging studies show confirmation of the dialysis line, and"

   - Pharmacy recs for dose adjustment with CVVH:
       - Cefepime 2 g IV Q12h
       - Flagyl does not need adjustment
       - Fluconazole should be reduced to 200 mg q24h
       - All other meds okay
       - Vancomycin dosing by level
   Renal recs
   - keep CVVH around 100-150cc off per hour to try and keep kidneys

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10340**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Removed 3.7 L fluid yesterday which was slightly more of an hourly rate
   than needed and resulted in a marked reduction in urine output.
   Neverthess, weaning parameters were improved.
   Medical Decision Making
   Our main goal is to proceed extubate and the recent volume removal has
   allowed us fluid sufficient to improve his weaning parameters.
   Yesterday, this resulted in reduced renal perfusion and anuria, but we
   plan to correct this today.  We will continue his antibiotic therapy as
   well.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal failure stage III, hypertension, chronic atrial fibrillation, and chronic peripheral vascular disease. He was admitted due to extensive lower extremity ulcers and was initially on the vascular service before being transferred to the medicine service.

The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrotic cardiomyopathy. He is now in respiratory failure post intubation and has hypotension off pressors.

Plan:
- Slow ultrafiltration to allow adequate kidney perfusion
- Continue CVVH goal 100-150 per hour
- Improve forward flow in the setting of poor heart function
- Restart milrinone along with IV lasix
- Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and fluconazole
- Stop flagyl and start bactrim at CVVH dose
- Goal CVP in upper teens to low 20s to better understand the patient's response

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure and is presenting with massive fluid overload. This can lead to further deterioration of cardiac function and worsening of renal failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

   HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS and summary of hospital course:
   66 yo male with hx of CHF, DMII, CRF stage III, HTN, chronic AFIB, and
   [**Hospital 1635**] transfered from [**Hospital3 1672**] on [**2177-2-19**] due to extensive  lower
   extremity ulcers. He was initailly on the vascular service then
   transfered to the medicine service on [**2177-2-20**] due to needed more tx for
   [**Last Name (un) **] HF and acute on chronic renal failure and concern of his rhythm.
   24 Hour Events:
   [**3-6**]
   - renal thinks rate of dialysis is too fast as we need some perfusion
   of his kidneys
   - Vanc held today given level of 27.7
   - Stopped allopurinol given question of present gout flare
   - Cut stress-dose steroids in half (50 -> 25 mg Hydrocort Na succ IV
   q24h)
   - ID recs:
       - Continue fluconazole ([**Date range (1) 11715**])
       - Continue IV vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl for RLE ? osteo cult pnd.
       - F/u wound tissue culture from [**3-3**]
       - (eye exam to exclude endophthalmitis completed (& negative)
       - Continue to follow daily vancomycin trough (ordered for [**Doctor First Name **])
   - Pharmacy recs for dose adjustment with CVVH:
       - Cefepime 2 g IV Q12h
       - Flagyl does not need adjustment
       - Fluconazole should be reduced to 200 mg q24h
       - All other meds okay
       - Vancomycin dosing by level
   Renal recs
   - keep CVVH around 100-150cc off per hour to try and keep kidneys
   perfused (aggressive goals may make him dialysis dependent)
   Late breaking ID recs
 pt. has pseudomonas
   -          stop flagyl
   -          continue to trough and daily dose vancomycin

   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. As above, pt had improved UOP in the setting of a slightly
   higher CVP, after receiving blood and albumin. Restarted milrinone
   along with IV lasix, no significant improvement in output, still net
   positive.  Pt is 3.7 L negative in 24 hrs. ABx redosed for CVVH.
   - Emphasize SLOW ultrafiltration to allow adequate kidney perfusion
   - continue  CVVH goal 100-150 per hr
   # Hypotension: Improved. Multiple possible etiologies, including
   hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood),
   cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature.
   - CVVH per above as ultrafiltration will assist in Frank-Starling
   physiology
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 400 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - stop flagyl per ID, start bactrim at cvvh dose (find out today)
   - goal CVP in upper teens to low 20
s, as that is when pt seems to have
   better UOP
   # Respiratory Failure and Vent.
   Will wean today
 fighting AC and satble on PSV 8/5 overnight. Gases
   good. Per CXR, likely large component of edema given CXR findings after
   reducing pressure support. This suggests pt is dependent on positive
   pressure to keep fluid out of lungs. Inspiratory effort is also poor at
   present, which is unexplained. Obesity and sedation likely
   contributors. Lung compliance in 40s and resistance acceptable.
   Therefore neuromuscular. [**Month (only) 11**] be due to sedation and low bicarb with

- 66-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, chronic kidney disease stage III, hypertension, and chronic atrial fibrillation.
- Admitted to the ICU for ulcer debridement, but quickly became unstable with hypotension and respiratory failure.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities and is experiencing acute on chronic renal failure.
- He has a positive blood culture for yeast, suggesting a possible central line infection.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia may be secondary to PPI use.

- He also has a history of hypothyroidism, which is being managed with levothyroxine.
- The patient has diffuse tophi and a history of tophaceous gout, and allopurinol is being continued.
- His recent laboratory results show elevated potassium levels.
- The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to the presence of polymicrobial chronic infection in the lower extremity ulcers.

   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt

   failure. As above, pt had improved UOP in the setting of a slightly
   higher CVP, after receiving blood and albumin. Restarted milrinone
   along with IV lasix, no significant improvement in output, still net
   positive.  Pt is negative 1.5 L since MN
   - Emphasize SLOW ultrafiltration to allow adequate kidney perfusion
   - continue  CVVH goal 100-200 per hr
   - will need to adjust medications with CVVH
   # Hypotension: Improved. Multiple possible etiologies, including
   hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood),
   cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature.
   - Transfuse per above
   - CVVH per above as ultrafiltration will assist in Frank-Starling
   physiology
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, plus increased fluconazole 400 mg IV
   Q24H (per ID and pharm)
   - goal CVP in upper teens to low 20
s, as that is when pt seems to have
   better UOP
   - Guiac all stools
   # Respiratory Faliure
   Per CXR, likely large component of edema given CXR findings after
   reducing pressure support. This suggests pt is dependent on positive
   pressure to keep fluid out of lungs. Inspiratory effort is also poor at
   present, which is unexplained. Obesity and sedation likely
   contributors. Lung compliance in 40s and resistance acceptable.
   Therefore neuromuscular. [**Month (only) 11**] be due to sedation and low bicarb with
   reduced drive. Needs longer trials of weaned pressure and further
   diuresis.
   - daily weaning trials
   - will attempt extubation today

   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. As above, pt had improved UOP in the setting of a slightly
   higher CVP, after receiving blood and albumin. Restarted milrinone
   along with IV lasix, no significant improvement in output, still net
   positive.  Pt is negative 1.5 L since MN
   - Emphasize SLOW ultrafiltration to allow adequate kidney perfusion
   - continue  CVVH goal 100-200 per hr
   - will need to adjust medications with CVVH
   # Hypotension: Resolved. Multiple possible etiologies, including
   hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood),
   cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature.
   - Transfuse per above
   - CVVH per above as ultrafiltration will assist in Frank-Starling
   physiology
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl, plus increased fluconazole from 200 mg
   IV Q24H to 400 mg IV Q24H (per ID and pharm)
   - goal CVP in upper teens to low 20
s, as that is when pt seems to have
   better UOP
   - Guiac all stools
   # Respiratory Faliure
   Per CXR, likely large component of edema given CXR findings after
   reducing pressure support. This suggests pt is dependent on positive
   pressure to keep fluid out of lungs. Inspiratory effort is also poor at
   present, which is unexplained. Obesity and sedation likely
   contributors. Lung compliance in 40s and resistance acceptable.
   Therefore neuromuscular. [**Month (only) 11**] be due to sedation and low bicarb with
   reduced drive. Needs longer trials of weaned pressure and further
   diuresis.
   - continue daily weaning trials
   - stop fentanyl gtt
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho

   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt
   -if no adequate HCT bump consider small dose of vitamin K
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr

   # LE ulcers: Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical

   results yield GPCs in pairs/clusters and GNRs suggesting polymicrobial
   chronic infection.

   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.

   - holding home colchicine for now
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - stress dose steroids in setting of critical illness (halved
   yesterday)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III, hypertension, and chronic atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the hospital due to extensive lower extremity ulcers and was initially on the vascular service before being transferred to the medicine service for further treatment of heart failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and rhythm concerns.

The patient's current condition is critical, with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, volume overload, hypotension, yeast fungemia, coagulopathy, acute on chronic renal failure, and lower extremity ulcers. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with positive pressure support.

Plan:
The plan includes addressing each of the patient's medical complications. For volume overload, slow ultrafiltration is recommended to allow for adequate kidney perfusion, along with continuing CVVH at a goal rate of 100-200 per hour. Hypotension has resolved but may be primarily cardiogenic in nature, so transfusion and CVVH are recommended. The patient's respiratory failure requires continued weaning trials and further diuresis. Yeast fungemia is being treated with fluconazole, and the central line is being resited. Coagulopathy is improving but should be monitored with CBC, INR, and PTT. Acute on chronic renal failure is likely prerenal,"

   # Respiratory Faliure
   Per CXR, likely large component of edema given CXR findings after

   pressure to keep fluid out of lungs. Inspiratory effort is also poor at

   contributors. Lung compliance in 40s and resistance acceptable.
   Therefore neuromuscular. [**Month (only) 11**] be due to sedation and low bicarb with

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal failure stage III, hypertension, and chronic atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU due to extensive lower extremity ulcers and later transferred to the CCU for heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been on various medications including vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for suspected osteomyelitis, fluconazole for yeast infection, and is also receiving CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). 

24-hour events:
- Vancomycin level was held due to a high level of 27.7.
- Allopurinol was stopped due to a concern of gout flare.
- Stress-dose steroids were reduced from 50 mg to 25 mg Hydrocortisone sodium succinate IV q24h.
- ID recommendations include continuing fluconazole, obtaining wound tissue culture results, and following up with micro data.
- Pharmacy recommendations for dose adjustment with CVVH include reducing fluconazole to 200 mg q24h and adjusting other medications as needed.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Volume Overload: The patient's massive fluid overload is likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of heart failure. The plan is to continue CVVH at a goal of 100-200 per hour, restart milrinone along with IV lasix, and aim for a CVP in the upper teens to low 20s.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but multiple possible etiologies including hypovolemia, distributive, and cardiogenic causes were identified. The plan includes transfusing packed red blood cells, continuing CVVH, and adjusting medications accordingly.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a large component of edema as per CXR findings after reducing pressure support. The plan is to continue daily weaning trials, stop fentanyl gtt, and further diuresis.

4. Yeast Fungemia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast, most likely from a central line. The plan is to continue fluconazole, follow up with ID recommendations, and micro data.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy has improved, and the INR is now 1.4. The plan is to trend CBC, INR, and PTT, hold off on further anticoagulation, consider small dose of vitamin K if necessary, and avoid further bleeding.

6. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely prerenal. The plan is to trend lytes, consider CVVH tomorrow, and follow up with renal recommendations.

7. Lower Extremity Ulcers: The patient's lower extremity ulcers are being managed by the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DM II), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III, hypertension (HTN), chronic atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and extensive lower extremity ulcers. The patient was initially admitted to the hospital due to extensive lower extremity ulcers and subsequently transferred to the ICU for further management of HF, acute on chronic renal failure, and concern regarding his rhythm.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Bacteremia
2. Diabetes mellitus type II
3. Hypothyroidism
4. Ulcerative colitis
5. Heart failure (diastolic), acute on chronic
6. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB)
7. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
8. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
9. Epistaxis (nosebleed)
10. Impaired skin integrity
11. Altered mental status (not delirium)
12. Chronic renal failure (CRF), chronic kidney disease

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, prophylactic DVT treatment with subcutaneous UF heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
- Heart rate: 81 bpm (71-95 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 131/48 mmHg (73/37-141/64 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (15-26 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation

The patient's lab results show:
- White blood cell count: 6.2 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
- Blood glucose: 273 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
- Sodium: 139 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.0 mEq/L
- Chloride: 107 mEq/L
- Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 2.3 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies reveal:
- CXR: No significant findings mentioned.
- Tissue culture from right calcaneus: Mixed bacterial types including gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and gram-negative rods. The organism identification and sensitivities are pending.
- Sputum culture: Yeast (sparse growth), further incubation required.
- Fungal culture: No fungus isolated.

The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level and the need for dialysis catheter placement. The patient also has evidence of bacteremia, with the presence of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods in the tissue culture.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:
1. Worsening heart failure due to acute decompensation or fluid overload.
2. Progression of renal failure and"

   are
   unchanged.
   Diffuse right-sided lung consolidation is minimally improved.
   Atelectasis and
   possible consolidation in the left lung base is stable. A small left
   pleural
   effusion is unchanged.
   IMPRESSION:
   The slight improvement in the right lung consolidation could also be
   due to
   improvement in superimposed asymmetrical pulmonary edema if there is
   known mitral valvular disease.

            are initially susceptible may become resistant within three to
            four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
   infections,
            repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. Ultrafiltration has been somewhat too brisk than necessary as
   we also want to maintain perfusion to kidneys that we hope may regain
   some function. Pt is 2.8 L negative in 24 hrs. LOS pt still nearly 5L
   positive.
   - Continue ultrafiltration at current rates to allow adequate kidney
   perfusion per renal
   - continue CVVH goal 75-100 per hr
   # Hypotension: Improved. Multiple possible etiologies, including
   hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood),
   cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature.
   - CVVH per above as ultrafiltration will assist in Frank-Starling
   physiology
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 400 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - stop flagyl per ID, start bactrim at 560mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxia:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema and possible PNA as evidenced by CXR.
   Inspiratory effort is also poor at present, which is unexplained, may
   be due to ventilator myopathy. Obesity and hypoventilation likely
   contributors. Needs further diuresis.
   - Continue diuresis
   -Encourage incentive spirometry
   - Continue antibiotics
   - CPAP PRN
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need to revisit intubation
   # LE ulcers: Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed
   - continue vanco/cefepime
   - stop flagyl per ID
   - f/u blood cx results
   - f/u vascular recs (Do they think this is Osteo or no active signs of
   osteo?)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho

   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   - Check C diff
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt

   problems on heparin gtt
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -consider CVVH tomorrow, as above
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type II diabetes mellitus, severe peripheral vascular disease, and multiple ulcerations. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently in respiratory failure after intubation and has hypotension off pressors. 

Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has fluid overload likely due to poor forward flow in the setting of heart failure. Ultrafiltration is being continued at current rates to allow adequate kidney perfusion while maintaining perfusion to the kidneys.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved and is likely primarily cardiogenic in nature. CVVH is being continued to assist in Frank-Starling physiology, and vanc/cefepime antibiotics are being continued along with increased fluconazole.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is most likely due to pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia as evidenced by the chest X-ray. Inspiratory effort is poor, possibly due to ventilator myopathy. Diuresis is being continued, incentive spirometry is encouraged, CPAP is being used as needed, and antibiotics are being continued.
4. Lower Extremity Ulcers: The ulcers are growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STEN"

   are
   unchanged.
   Diffuse right-sided lung consolidation is minimally improved.
   Atelectasis and
   possible consolidation in the left lung base is stable. A small left
   pleural
   effusion is unchanged.
   IMPRESSION:
   The slight improvement in the right lung consolidation could also be
   due to
   improvement in superimposed asymmetrical pulmonary edema if there is
   known mitral valvular disease.

   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. Ultrafiltration has been somewhat too brisk than necessary as
   we also want to maintain perfusion to kidneys that we hope may regain
   some function. Pt is 2.8 L negative in 24 hrs. LOS pt still nearly 5L
   positive.
   - Continue ultrafiltration at current rates to allow adequate kidney
   perfusion per renal
   - continue CVVH goal 75-100 per hr
   # Hypotension: Improved. Multiple possible etiologies, including
   hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood),
   cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature.
   - CVVH per above as ultrafiltration will assist in Frank-Starling
   physiology
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 400 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - stop flagyl per ID, start bactrim at 560mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxia:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema and possible PNA as evidenced by CXR.
   Inspiratory effort is also poor at present, which is unexplained, may
   be due to ventilator myopathy. Obesity and hypoventilation likely
   contributors. Needs further diuresis.
   - Continue diuresis
   -Encourage incentive spirometry
   - Continue antibiotics
   - CPAP PRN
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need to revisit intubation
   # LE ulcers: Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed
   - continue vanco/cefepime
   - stop flagyl per ID
   - f/u blood cx results
   - f/u vascular recs (Do they think this is Osteo or no active signs of
   osteo?)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole
   - bactrim for stenotrophamonas

   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   - Check C diff
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT

   FINDINGS: The patient has been extubated and the NG tube has been
   removed.
   The position of the right internal jugular catheter and left JVP line
   are
   unchanged.
   Diffuse right-sided lung consolidation is minimally improved.
   Atelectasis and
   possible consolidation in the left lung base is stable. A small left
   pleural
   effusion is unchanged.
   IMPRESSION:
   The slight improvement in the right lung consolidation could also be
   due to
   improvement in superimposed asymmetrical pulmonary edema if there is
   known mitral valvular disease.

   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. Ultrafiltration has been somewhat too brisk than necessary as
   we also want to maintain perfusion to kidneys that we hope may regain
   some function. Pt is 2.8 L negative in 24 hrs. LOS pt still nearly 6L
   positive.
   - Continue ultrafiltration at current rates to allow adequate kidney
   perfusion per renal, much improved today
   - continue CVVH goal 100-150 per hr
   # Hypotension: Improved. Multiple possible etiologies, including
   hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood),
   cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature.
   - CVVH per above as ultrafiltration will assist in Frank-Starling
   physiology
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 400 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - stop flagyl per ID, start bactrim at
   # Hypoxia:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema as evidenced by CXR. Inspiratory effort
   is also poor at present, which is unexplained, may be due to ventilator
   myopathy. Obesity and hypoventilation likely contributors. Needs
   further diuresis.
   - Continue diuresis
   -Encourage incentive spirometry
   # LE ulcers: Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed
   - continue vanco/cefepime
   - stop flagyl per ID
   - f/u blood cx results
   - f/u vascular recs (Do they think this is Osteo or no active signs of
   osteo?)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole
   - bactrim for stenotrophamonas
   -f/u ID recs

   - ? add bactrim
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   - Check C diff
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt
   -if no adequate HCT bump consider small dose of vitamin K
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -consider CVVH tomorrow, as above
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - stress dose steroids in setting of critical illness (halved
   yesterday)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), type II diabetes mellitus (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with multiple ulcerations, and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fib. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure post-intubation and hypotension off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has significant fluid overload, which may be related to poor forward flow in the setting of heart failure. Ultrafiltration has been somewhat brisk, but it is necessary to maintain adequate kidney perfusion. Continuing CVVH at goal rates of 100-150 per hour is recommended.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to various factors, including hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood), or cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improving the patient's Frank-Starling physiology through CVVH and continuing vancomycin and cefepime are advised.

3. Hypoxia: The patient likely has [**1-7**] pulmonary edema as evidenced by the chest X-ray. Inspiratory effort"

   FINDINGS: The patient has been extubated and the NG tube has been
   removed.
   The position of the right internal jugular catheter and left JVP line
   are
   unchanged.
   Diffuse right-sided lung consolidation is minimally improved.
   Atelectasis and
   possible consolidation in the left lung base is stable. A small left
   pleural
   effusion is unchanged.
   IMPRESSION:
   The slight improvement in the right lung consolidation could also be
   due to
   improvement in superimposed asymmetrical pulmonary edema if there is
   known mitral valvular disease.

            four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
   infections,
            repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is described as tenuous and they are alternating between using a face tent and biPAP. This indicates ongoing difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the bloodstream is indicated by the microbiology report showing Clostridium difficile toxin A & B, as well as positive gram stains from sputum, tissue, and stool samples. This suggests an infection that may have spread systemically.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The fluid balance shows a significant negative balance, indicating potential fluid loss and reduced kidney function. The elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) further support the diagnosis of AKI.

4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The high glucose level of 217 mg/dL combined with the presence of ketones in the urine suggests DKA, a complication commonly seen in patients with uncontrolled diabetes.

5. Hypothyroidism: The low TSH level indicates hypothyroidism, which can contribute to various systemic complications.

6. Ulcerative colitis: The patient has a known history of ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon.

7. Heart failure: The elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level and symptoms such as shortness"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. Ultrafiltration has been somewhat too brisk, as we also want
   to maintain perfusion to kidneys that we hope may regain some function.
   Pt is 2.8 L negative in 24 hrs. LOS pt still about 3.6 L positive.
   - Rest off CVVH this a.m. to see if urine output picks up
 stimulate
   w/ Lasix 40, then metolazone 5 and Lasix 80, then consider restarting
   CVVH (particularly if patient becomes more short of breath)
   # Hypotension
   Improved. Multiple possible etiologies, including hypovolemia
   (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood), cardiogenic
   (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of bleeding and
   cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily cardiogenic in nature.
   Now patient is in AF again and pressures are slightly lower
 typically
   in 110s on average.
   - Attempt to increase UOP as above, otherwise CVVH again.
   - Consider cardioversion again
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 400 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - bactrim at 560mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxia
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Continue diuresis
   - Encourage incentive spirometry
   - Continue antibiotics
   - CPAP PRN, trial ultra-high flow nasal pressure support
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need to revisit intubation
   # LE ulcers
   Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS)
   MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to bactrim. Vascular
   has been following, and may recommend surgical debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed
   - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Reconsult vascular about intervention for LE arterial insufficiency
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Likely due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient
   is presently broadly covered.
   - Check C diff
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and severe peripheral vascular disease presenting with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of a fibrillating heart. The patient is currently in respiratory failure and has undergone intubation. The patient also has hypotension, likely due to hypovolemia, distributive, or cardiogenic causes. There is evidence of pulmonary edema, possibly secondary to mitral valvular disease, as well as C. difficile toxin A & B in the stool. The patient has positive blood cultures for yeast, most likely originating from a central line infection. The patient also has lower extremity ulcers infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Enterobacter cloacae. The patient's thrombocytopenia may be secondary to proton pump inhibitor use, and the coagulopathy is improving with an INR of 1.4. The patient's renal failure is likely pre-renal, with a creatinine level stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8). Other medical conditions include topheaceous gout, ulcerative colitis, hypothyroidism, and hypoglycemia.

   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. Ultrafiltration has been somewhat too brisk than necessary as
   we also want to maintain perfusion to kidneys that we hope may regain
   some function. Pt is 2.8 L negative in 24 hrs. LOS pt still nearly 5L
   positive.
   - Continue ultrafiltration at current rates to allow adequate kidney
   perfusion per renal
   - continue CVVH goal 75-100 per hr
   # Hypotension: Improved. Multiple possible etiologies, including
   hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood),
   cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature.
   - CVVH per above as ultrafiltration will assist in Frank-Starling
   physiology
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 400 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - stop flagyl per ID, start bactrim at 560mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxia:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema and possible PNA as evidenced by CXR.
   Inspiratory effort is also poor at present, which is unexplained, may
   be due to ventilator myopathy. Obesity and hypoventilation likely
   contributors. Needs further diuresis.
   - Continue diuresis
   -Encourage incentive spirometry
   - Continue antibiotics
   - CPAP PRN
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need to revisit intubation
   # LE ulcers: Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) presenting with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. The patient is now in respiratory failure following intubation and has hypotension off pressors.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Volume Overload: The patient has massive fluid overload, which can lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema, worsening heart failure, and electrolyte imbalances.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to various causes such as hypovolemia, distributive (septic) shock, or cardiogenic shock. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's poor respiratory effort and obesity contribute to hypoventilation, leading to hypoxia. This can result in decreased oxygen supply to vital organs and may require assistance with mechanical ventilation.

4. Infections: The patient has multiple positive cultures for different organisms, indicating a high risk of hospital-acquired infections. These infections could include yeast fungemia, bacterial infections (such as Staphylococcus aureus"

   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of pt
s heart
   failure. Ultrafiltration has been somewhat too brisk, as we also want
   to maintain perfusion to kidneys that we hope may regain some function.
   Pt is 2.8 L negative in 24 hrs. LOS pt still about 3.6 L positive.
   - Rest off CVVH this a.m. to see if urine output picks up
 stimulate
   w/ Lasix 40, then metolazone 5 and Lasix 80, then consider restarting
   CVVH (particularly if patient becomes more short of breath)
   # Hypotension
   Improved. Multiple possible etiologies, including hypovolemia
   (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood), cardiogenic
   (given CHF, frequent ectopy). Improved with resolution of bleeding and
   cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily cardiogenic in nature.
   Now patient is in AF again and pressures are slightly lower
 typically
   in 110s on average.
   - Attempt to increase UOP as above, otherwise CVVH again.
   - Consider cardioversion again
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 400 mg IV Q24H

   - bactrim at 560mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxia
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Continue diuresis
   - Encourage incentive spirometry
   - Continue antibiotics
   - CPAP PRN, trial ultra-high flow nasal pressure support

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and severe peripheral vascular disease. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure, which is now in respiratory failure after intubation and hypotension off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has a history of heart failure and is currently experiencing fluid overload. This can lead to further respiratory distress and worsening heart failure symptoms.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to various causes, including hypovolemia, distributive (septic) shock, or cardiogenic shock. It requires close monitoring and appropriate management.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be attributed to pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Diuresis, incentive spirometry, and CPAP/ultra-high flow nasal pressure support should be continued to improve oxygenation.
4. Lower Extremity Ulcers: The patient has ulcers on the lower extremities that are infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Enterobacter cloacae. Bactrim should be continued, and surgical debridement may be necessary.

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Code today with hypotension, then hypoxia, then
   bradycardia. Successful resuscitation with short interval of
   hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia
   Differentials include fluid overload with poor forward flow in the
   context of holding CVVH. ACS possible. Appears, based on telemetry,
   that hypotension came first. [**Month (only) 11**] have had sinus arrest with ventricular
   escape, but hypotension appeared first. Precise etiology unclear. Also
   CXR significant for pulmonary edema in early resolution after
   re-intubation and restoration of pressure support (cephalization not
   present, but still fluffy infiltrate). Amiodarone reloaded. Atropine
   and epinephrine also given. Unclear whether VT occurred in context of
   atropine and epinephrine.
   - Restart CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone gtt
   - Defer to fellow/attending about continuing PO amiodarone and discuss
   etiology with them
   - Block cholinergic input to sinoatrial node
 more atropine, then
   other agents to stimulate sinoatrial node discharge.
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - Nodal stimulation (reduce cholinergic tone to node)
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 400 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - bactrim at 560mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxia
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Keep intubated for now, CPAP PRN, trial ultra-high flow nasal
   pressure support after weaning again
   # LE ulcers
   Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS)
   MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to bactrim. Vascular
   has been following, and may recommend surgical debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed
   - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Reconsult vascular about intervention for LE arterial insufficiency
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole, now 400 mg (from 200mg yesterday)
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Likely due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient
   is presently broadly covered.
   - Check C diff
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III, hypertension (HTN), chronic atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and extensive lower extremity ulcers. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to an ulcer debridement and subsequent development of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. 

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including respiratory failure requiring intubation, hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia, volume overload, and yeast fungemia. The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple codes called due to these complications.

The patient's current plan includes restarting continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH), maintaining pressure support, administering antibiotics, and closely monitoring the patient's condition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II, chronic atrial fibrillation, and chronic renal failure. He was admitted to the hospital due to extensive lower extremity ulcers. The patient's medical complications include heart failure, atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. He has been receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU, including invasive ventilation, administration of antibiotics, diuretics, and pressors. The patient experienced a code blue event during which he developed bradycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, and ventricular tachycardia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia and has been receiving antibiotics. This indicates a risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and complications related to the endotracheal tube.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure. There is a risk of worsening renal function and the need for renal replacement therapy, such as dialysis.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. There is a risk of further cardiac complications,"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Code today with hypotension, then hypoxia, then
   bradycardia. Successful resuscitation with short interval of
   hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia
   Differentials include fluid overload with poor forward flow in the
   context of holding CVVH. ACS possible. Appears, based on telemetry,
   that hypotension came first. [**Month (only) 11**] have had sinus arrest with ventricular
   escape, but hypotension appeared first. Precise etiology unclear. Also
   CXR significant for pulmonary edema in early resolution after
   re-intubation and restoration of pressure support (cephalization not
   present, but still fluffy infiltrate). Amiodarone reloaded. Atropine
   and epinephrine also given. Unclear whether VT occurred in context of
   atropine and epinephrine.
   - Restart CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone gtt
   - Defer to fellow/attending about continuing PO amiodarone and discuss
   etiology with them
   - Block cholinergic input to sinoatrial node
 more atropine, then
   other agents to stimulate sinoatrial node discharge.
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - Consider cardioversion again
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 400 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - bactrim at 560mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxia
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Continue diuresis
   - Encourage incentive spirometry
   - Continue antibiotics
   - CPAP PRN, trial ultra-high flow nasal pressure support
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need to revisit intubation
   # LE ulcers
   Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS)
   MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to bactrim. Vascular
   has been following, and may recommend surgical debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed
   - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Reconsult vascular about intervention for LE arterial insufficiency
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Likely due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient
   is presently broadly covered.
   - Check C diff
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III, hypertension (HTN), and obesity. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to extensive lower extremity ulcers and acute exacerbation of CHF, as well as concern for his rhythm. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has experienced multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which could be due to fluid overload, poor forward flow, or cardiac causes.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely caused by pulmonary edema, possibly secondary to CHF exacerbation or pneumonia.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has had sinus arrest with ventricular escape, which may be related to his underlying AF or other cardiac issues.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.
5. Ulcerative Colitis: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis and is on chronic steroids.
6. Yeast Fungemia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast, suggesting possible fungemia.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be secondary to proton pump"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III, hypertension (HTN), chronic atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and ulcerative colitis. The patient was admitted due to extensive lower extremity ulcers and was initially on the vascular service before being transferred to the medicine service.

The patient experienced several complications during his stay in the ICU, including:

1. Ulcer debridement: The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The fluid overload is likely related to poor forward flow in the setting of the patient's heart failure. Ultrafiltration has been somewhat too brisk, as we also want to maintain perfusion to the kidneys that we hope may regain some function. The patient is 2.8 L negative in 24 hours, with a LOS still about 3.6 L positive.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension improved after the resolution of bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. However, the patient is now in AF again, and pressures are slightly lower typically in the 110s on average. The potential etiologies for hypotension include hypovolemia (bleeding, diuresis), distributive (given yeast in blood), and cardiogenic (given CHF, frequent ectopy).

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Code today with hypotension, then hypoxia, then
   bradycardia. Successful resuscitation with short interval of
   hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia
   Differentials include fluid overload with poor forward flow in the
   context of holding CVVH. ACS possible. Appears, based on telemetry,
   that hypotension came first. [**Month (only) 11**] have had sinus arrest with ventricular
   escape, but hypotension appeared first. Precise etiology unclear. Also
   CXR significant for pulmonary edema in early resolution after
   re-intubation and restoration of pressure support (cephalization not
   present, but still fluffy infiltrate). Amiodarone reloaded. Atropine
   and epinephrine also given. Unclear whether VT occurred in context of
   atropine and epinephrine.
   - Restart CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone gtt
   - Defer to fellow/attending about continuing PO amiodarone and discuss
   etiology with them
   - Block cholinergic input to sinoatrial node
 more atropine, then
   other agents to stimulate sinoatrial node discharge.
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - Nodal stimulation (reduce cholinergic tone to node)
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 400 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - bactrim at 560mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxia
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Keep intubated for now, CPAP PRN, trial ultra-high flow nasal
   pressure support after weaning again

1. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which can be due to fluid overload, poor forward flow, or cardiogenic causes. It is important to monitor blood pressure and adjust fluid balance accordingly.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may be attributed to pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory support is necessary.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has had episodes of bradycardia, possibly related to medications"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   # Hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia: Resolved for now.
   Differentials include fluid overload with poor forward flow in the
   context of holding CVVH. ACS possible. Appears, based on telemetry,
   that hypotension came first. [**Month (only) 11**] have had sinus arrest with ventricular
   escape, but hypotension appeared first. Precise etiology unclear. Also
   CXR significant for pulmonary edema in early resolution after
   re-intubation and restoration of pressure support (cephalization not
   present, but still fluffy infiltrate). Amiodarone reloaded. Atropine
   and epinephrine also given. Unclear whether VT occurred in context of
   atropine and epinephrine.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - bactrim at 1100 mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Keep intubated for now, CPAP PRN, trial ultra-high flow nasal
   pressure support after weaning again
   # LE ulcers
   Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS)
   MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to bactrim. Vascular
   has been following, and may recommend surgical debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed
   - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Reconsult vascular about intervention for LE arterial insufficiency
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole, now 800 mg (from 400mg yesterday)
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Likely due to

, but will keep infection in mind. Patient
   is presently broadly covered.
   - Check C diff - negative
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including systolic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and a history of atrial fibrillation. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient has had several recent codes due to hypotension, hypoxia, and bradycardia, with one successful resuscitation. He is currently intubated and on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid overload is likely contributing to his hypotension and poor renal perfusion. CVVH has been started with gentle goals to address this issue.
2. Hypotension/Hypoxia/Bradycardia: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of hypotension, hypoxia, and bradycardia, which have required resuscitation. The cause of these events is unclear, but fluid overload and poor forward flow may be contributing factors. The patient is being closely monitored and treated with appropriate interventions.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows signs of pulmonary edema, likely secondary to his fluid overload. Diuretics are being used to manage this condition.
4. Yeast Fungemia: The patient has a positive blood culture for"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Change bactrim to PO to reduce 2 liters of IV fluid intake
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   # Hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**]
   volume overload causing hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology
   leading to pulmonary edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - bactrim at 1100 mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash added
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Keep intubated for now, CPAP PRN, trial ultra-high flow nasal
   pressure support after weaning again
   - Readdress goals of care
   # LE ulcers
   Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS)
   MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to bactrim. Vascular
   has been following, and may recommend surgical debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed
   - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Reconsult vascular about intervention for LE arterial insufficiency
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole, now 800 mg (from 400mg yesterday)
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Likely due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient
   is presently broadly covered.
   - Check C diff - negative
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and multiple ulcerations. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient is currently in respiratory failure following intubation and has hypotension. He has had a recent cardiac arrest and is now on a ventilator. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, chronic renal failure, and episodes of nosebleeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient's massive fluid overload may lead to further hypotension, pulmonary edema, and worsening of renal perfusion.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could be due to poor forward flow, hypovolemia, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if not adequately managed, leading to further hypoxia and potential ARDS.
4. Yeast Fungemia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast, indicating a risk of systemic fungal infection.
5. Ulcer Debridement: The patient has lower extremity ulcers infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Enterobacter cloacae. Surgical debridement"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Change bactrim to PO to reduce 2 liters of IV fluid intake
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   # Hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**]
   volume overload causing hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology
   leading to pulmonary edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and multiple ulcerations. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient was intubated and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation after experiencing hypotension, then hypoxia, and bradycardia. He has been in the ICU for several days, during which time he developed respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema and required continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). He also had a yeast fungemia, which was likely due to a central line infection, and had positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Enterobacter cloacae. The patient has several other medical conditions, including diabetes, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, tophaceous gout, and a history of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid overload could lead to further hypotension and respiratory distress.
2. Hypotension/Hypoxia/Bradycardia: These symptoms could recur due to ongoing cardiac issues or other factors such as infection or fluid overload.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory difficulties due to"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Change bactrim to PO to reduce 2 liters of IV fluid intake
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   # Hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**]
   volume overload causing hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology
   leading to pulmonary edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - bactrim at 1100 mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash added
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Keep intubated for now, CPAP PRN, trial ultra-high flow nasal
   pressure support after weaning again
   - Readdress goals of care
   # LE ulcers
   Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS)
   MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to bactrim. Vascular
   has been following, and may recommend surgical debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed
   - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Reconsult vascular about intervention for LE arterial insufficiency
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole, now 800 mg (from 400mg yesterday)
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Likely due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient
   is presently broadly covered.
   - Check C diff - negative
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and ulcerative colitis. The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of a fibrillating heart. He has had recent episodes of hypotension, hypoxia, and bradycardia, which were successfully resuscitated.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension (stable), hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to pulmonary edema, and localized edema with possible ulcers on the lower extremities. He has been diagnosed with yeast fungemia and is being treated with fluconazole. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and acute-on-chronic renal failure.

Plan:
1. Restart CVVH with gentle goals off to manage volume overload and improve renal perfusion.
2. Change bactrim to PO to reduce IV fluid intake.
3. Continue CVVH, amiodarone PO, and antibiotics.
4. Elevate head of bed, perform oral care, and consider ultra-high flow nasal pressure support after weaning trials.
5. Readdress goals of care.
6. Continue bactrim, vancomycin, and cefepime antibiotics for LE ulcers.

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   # Hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia: Resolved for now.
   Differentials include fluid overload with poor forward flow in the
   context of holding CVVH. ACS possible. Appears, based on telemetry,
   that hypotension came first. [**Month (only) 11**] have had sinus arrest with ventricular
   escape, but hypotension appeared first. Precise etiology unclear. Also
   CXR significant for pulmonary edema in early resolution after
   re-intubation and restoration of pressure support (cephalization not
   present, but still fluffy infiltrate). Amiodarone reloaded. Atropine
   and epinephrine also given. Unclear whether VT occurred in context of
   atropine and epinephrine.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - bactrim at 1100 mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Keep intubated for now, CPAP PRN, trial ultra-high flow nasal
   pressure support after weaning again
   # LE ulcers
   Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS)
   MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to bactrim. Vascular
   has been following, and may recommend surgical debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed
   - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Reconsult vascular about intervention for LE arterial insufficiency
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole, now 800 mg (from 400mg yesterday)
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Likely due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient
   is presently broadly covered.
   - Check C diff - negative
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including systolic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and a history of atrial fibrillation. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient had a recent cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. He is currently intubated and receiving continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid overload needs to be managed carefully to prevent further complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiac dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to poor forward flow and fluid overload. It is important to monitor and manage blood pressure to prevent further complications.
3. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions such as weaning trials, head of bed elevation, and antibiotic therapy are necessary.
4. Lower Extremity Ulcers: The patient has ulcers on his lower extremities infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Enterobacter cloacae. These infections need to be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and surgical debridement may be required.
5. Yeast Fungemia: The"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's progress includes:

- Increased fluconazole and bactrim dosages as per pharmacy recommendations.
- Restarted tube feeding (TF) now that the patient is nothing by mouth (NPO) from intubation.
- Sent for C. difficile and blood and urine cultures due to elevated white count and hypotension.
- Got an echo to rule out pulmonary embolism (PE) as the cause of cardiopulmonary arrest, but it was not remarkable.
- The patient has a history of ulcer debridement and has received various antibiotics including vancomycin, fluconazole, cefepime, and bactrim.
- The patient is currently on midazolam (Versed), fentanyl (Concentrate), and norepinephrine infusions.
- Other ICU medications include unspecified ""other medications.""
- The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/47 to 135/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's weight has increased from 112 kg at admission to 127.9 kg currently.
- Fluid balance shows an input of 5,895 mL and output of 4,936 mL, resulting in a balance of 959 mL.
- The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 286, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 38 mmol/L.
- Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 152,000 cells/microliter, elevated blood glucose level of 207 mg/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 1.7 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 2.2 mmol/L, and elevated D-dimer level of 238 ng/mL.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows moderate cardiomegaly with severe retrocardiac atelectasis, small left-sided pleural effusion, severe perihilar parenchymal opacities likely reflecting pulmonary edema, mild blunting of the right costophrenic sinus, and no newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
- Microbiology results are pending for urine and blood cultures.
- The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, renal failure (acute and chronic), respiratory failure (acute), epistaxis, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and hypotension suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and fluid balance indicate the potential for AKI.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray findings of severe perihilar parenchymal opacities likely reflecting pulmonary edema may worsen if not appropriately managed.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's mechanical ventilation and risk factors such as impaired skin integrity increase the risk of developing VAP.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobilization and risk factors increase the risk of developing DVT and PE.
6. C. difficile infection: The patient's recent antibiotic use increases the risk of C. difficile infection.
7. Worsening diabetes control: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control, which may further complicate their diabetes.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, respiratory failure, epistaxis, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, chronic renal failure, and kidney disease. He presented to the hospital with complaints of ulcer debridement. The patient has been in the ICU since 02/23/2177 and is currently intubated on mechanical ventilation. His current medications include fluconazole, bactrim, midazolam, fentanyl, and norepinephrine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/47-135/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's blood cultures, urine culture, and stool C. difficile toxin test are pending. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's imaging studies reveal moderate cardiomegaly, severe retrocardiac atelectasis, small left-sided pleural effusion, and severe perihilar pulmonary edema. The patient's medical complications include bacteremia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient has several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are pending, indicating a possible bloodstream infection.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated on mechanical ventilation, suggesting acute respiratory failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of chronic renal failure suggest the possibility of acute renal failure.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to pressure ulcers or other skin infections.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to various factors such as medication side effects, hypoxia, or sepsis.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, which could contribute to his current renal issues.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is recommended for accurate diagnosis and treatment."

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   # Hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia: Resolved for now.
   Differentials include fluid overload with poor forward flow in the

   that hypotension came first. [**Month (only) 11**] have had sinus arrest with ventricular
   escape, but hypotension appeared first. Precise etiology unclear. Also
   CXR significant for pulmonary edema in early resolution after
   re-intubation and restoration of pressure support (cephalization not
   present, but still fluffy infiltrate). Amiodarone reloaded. Atropine
   and epinephrine also given. Unclear whether VT occurred in context of
   atropine and epinephrine.
   - Restart CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone gtt
   - Defer to fellow/attending about continuing PO amiodarone and discuss
   etiology with them
   - Block cholinergic input to sinoatrial node
 more atropine, then
   other agents to stimulate sinoatrial node discharge.
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.

   volume overload.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB). The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient experienced a cardiac arrest on [date] and was successfully resuscitated. He has been hypotensive and hypoxic at times, requiring interventions such as atropine, epinephrine, and amiodarone. His blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Enterobacter cloacae, all sensitive to bactrim. There is also evidence of yeast fungemia, likely originating from a central line.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. His electrolytes are somewhat imbalanced, and he has low platelets possibly secondary to proton pump inhibitor use. The patient has diffuse tophi, indicative of long-standing g"

   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   # Hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia: Resolved for now.
   Differentials include fluid overload with poor forward flow in the

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and multiple ulcerations. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. He has been in respiratory failure since intubation and is currently hypotensive off pressors. He was extubated and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) was stopped yesterday. The patient had a code on [**2177-3-9**] due to hypotension, then hypoxia, followed by bradycardia. Resuscitation was successful, but the patient experienced a short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has likely volume overload, which could be the cause of his hypotension and poor renal perfusion. CVVH was previously stopped abruptly, leading to a significant volume overload.
2. Hypotension, Hypoxia, Bradycardia: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension followed by hypoxia and bradycardia. This could be due to fluid overload with poor forward flow or acute chest syndrome (ACS). The precise etiology is unclear, but it appears that"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   # Hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia: Resolved for now.
   Differentials include fluid overload with poor forward flow in the
   context of holding CVVH. ACS possible. Appears, based on telemetry,
   that hypotension came first. [**Month (only) 11**] have had sinus arrest with ventricular
   escape, but hypotension appeared first. Precise etiology unclear. Also
   CXR significant for pulmonary edema in early resolution after
   re-intubation and restoration of pressure support (cephalization not
   present, but still fluffy infiltrate). Amiodarone reloaded. Atropine
   and epinephrine also given. Unclear whether VT occurred in context of
   atropine and epinephrine.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - bactrim at 1100 mg IV Q12H
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Keep intubated for now, CPAP PRN, trial ultra-high flow nasal
   pressure support after weaning again
   # LE ulcers
   Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS)
   MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to bactrim. Vascular
   has been following, and may recommend surgical debridement in future.
   - Continue bactrim 650mg IV Q12 at CVVH doses, will need to readjust
   after CVVH completed
   - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Reconsult vascular about intervention for LE arterial insufficiency
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -continue fluconazole, now 800 mg (from 400mg yesterday)
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Likely due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient
   is presently broadly covered.
   - Check C diff - negative
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and ulcerative colitis. The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. He has been in respiratory failure requiring intubation and has hypotension off pressors. The patient had a code on [**2177-3-9**] due to hypotension, then hypoxia, and finally bradycardia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has fluid overload, which can lead to further hypotension and poor renal perfusion.
2. Hypotension, Hypoxia, Bradycardia: The patient experienced these three events, which can be related to fluid overload with poor forward flow, possibly due to the cessation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The precise etiology is unclear.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, indicating respiratory failure.
4. Yeast Fungemia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast, likely originating from a central line infection.
5. Thrombocytopenia"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash added, protonix (can DC if
   extubated)
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Try PSV and wean down PEEP to 5 with goal of possible extubation
   today
   - Readdress goals of care, if no improvement in [**12-7**] days, wife may opt
   for terminal extubation
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. Has been negative 2.4L.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. Vascular not interested in intervention.
   - Continue increased Bactrim DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for
   poor PO absorption - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and
   enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   - starting aspirin 81mg PO Daily (held due to recent severe ENT
   hemorrhage on [**2177-2-24**])
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)
   # Yeast fungemia

   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.

   - Check C diff - negative
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. He has been intubated and is currently in respiratory failure. The patient also has multiple ulcerations on his lower extremities due to PVD, which are infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Enterobacter cloacae. These bacteria are sensitive to Bactrim.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
- Daily weaning trials
- HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash added, protonix (can DC if extubated)
- Continue diuresis with CVVH
- Continue antibiotics
- Try PSV and wean down PEEP to 5 with goal of possible extubation today
- Readdress goals of care, if no improvement in 12 days, wife may opt for terminal extubation

2. Volume Overload:
- Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100 cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
- Continue ultrafiltr"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and severe peripheral vascular disease. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of a fibrillation. The patient experienced multiple code events, including one recent cardiac arrest on 3/9/2177, and is now intubated and on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including volume overload, hypotension, respiratory failure, ventricular fibrillation arrest, lower extremity ulcers, and yeast fungemia. He also has a history of chronic medications for conditions such as hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, and tophaceous gout.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient is likely experiencing volume overload, which can lead to further fluid accumulation and worsen his renal function.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may recur, potentially leading to poor organ perfusion and increased risk of further complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if he does not improve, leading to prolonged intubation and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Ventricular Fibrillation Arrest: The patient has had episodes of ventricular fibrillation arrest,"

   Imaging: CXR AP [**2177-3-11**]:
   HISTORY: CHF and status post cardiopulmonary arrest.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-10**], there is continued
   enlargement
   of the cardiac silhouette with extensive opacification in the
   retrocardiac
   region. This is most likely consistent with severe atelectasis and
   small
   effusion, though the possibility of supervening pneumonia could
   certainly not
   be excluded. The patchy opacification on the right is somewhat less.
   This
   most likely represents asymmetric pulmonary edema, though aspiration
   could
   certainly not be excluded.
   Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
   Microbiology: No new growth. Mycolytics remain negative.

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash added, protonix (can DC if
   extubated)
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Try PSV and wean down PEEP to 5 with goal of possible extubation
   today
   - Readdress goals of care, if no improvement in [**12-7**] days, wife may opt
   for terminal extubation
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. Has been negative 2.4L.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. Vascular not interested in intervention.
   - Continue increased Bactrim DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for
   poor PO absorption - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and
   enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   - starting aspirin 81mg PO Daily (held due to recent severe ENT
   hemorrhage on [**2177-2-24**])
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and multiple ulcerations. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of a fibrillating heart. The patient has been in respiratory failure since intubation and has hypotension off pressors. He was successfully resuscitated after a code on [date] in the setting of hypotension, then hypoxia, and finally bradycardia.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, volume overload, hypotension, yeast fungemia, low-grade temperature, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute-on-chronic renal failure, tophaceous gout, ulcerative colitis, and hypothyroidism. 

In terms of potential medical complications, there is a risk of further respiratory failure if the patient does not improve and requires terminal extubation. There is also a risk of worsening renal failure due to ongoing volume overload and the need for continued dialysis. The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening heart failure or arrhythmias. Infection control measures should be continued to prevent or manage any potential infections"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis. Given recent fevers however, would be
   concerned for VAP given change in sputum color
   - Pan culture, including endotracheal sputum
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash added, protonix (can DC if
   extubated)
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Try PSV and wean down PEEP to 5 with goal of possible extubation
   today
   - Try to extubate today
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. LOS balance at 1.4L positive.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - will try to wean levophed to expedite
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Concern for infection given off of CVVH. However, also possibly due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient is presently
   broadly covered.
   - Panculture blood, urine, sputum, and c diff
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. Vascular not interested in intervention.
   - Continue increased Bactrim DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for
   poor PO absorption - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and
   enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - Check vanc trough today
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   - starting aspirin 81mg PO Daily (held due to recent severe ENT
   hemorrhage on [**2177-2-24**])
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -DC Fluconazole yesterday
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and multiple ulcerations. The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. He is currently in respiratory failure post intubation and has hypotension off pressors. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, volume overload, hypotension, low-grade fever, ventricular fibrillation arrest, leg ulcers, yeast fungemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute-on-chronic renal failure, tophaceous gout, ulcerative colitis, hypothyroidism, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is currently in respiratory failure post intubation, and there is a concern for pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Daily weaning trials and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) have been recommended to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Volume overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload, which may be contributing to his hypotension and renal failure. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been initiated to manage fluid balance and renal function.

3. Hypotension: The"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis. Given recent fevers however, would be
   concerned for VAP given change in sputum color
   - Pan culture, including endotracheal sputum
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash added, protonix (can DC if
   extubated)
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Try PSV and wean down PEEP to 5 with goal of possible extubation
   today
   - Try to extubate today
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. LOS balance at 1.4L positive.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - will try to wean levophed to expedite
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Concern for infection given off of CVVH. However, also possibly due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient is presently
   broadly covered.
   - Panculture blood, urine, sputum, and c diff
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. Vascular not interested in intervention.
   - Continue increased Bactrim DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for
   poor PO absorption - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and
   enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - Check vanc trough today
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   - starting aspirin 81mg PO Daily (held due to recent severe ENT
   hemorrhage on [**2177-2-24**])
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -DC Fluconazole yesterday
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and ulcerative colitis. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient has been intubated and is currently in respiratory failure. He also has hypotension and requires vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is in respiratory failure, and there is a concern for pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to perform a panculture, including endotracheal sputum, elevate the head of bed, use chlorhexadine oral wash, and wean off sedation.
2. Volume overload: The patient has ongoing fluid overload, which may be related to poor forward flow and hypotension. CVVH will be restarted with gentle goals off, and ultrafiltration will be continued with a goal of 2-2.5L negative per day.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and it is important to continue CVVH with gentle goals for negative fluid balance. Vasopressors will be continued, and the patient's condition will be monitored.
4. Low-grade temperature: The patient has a low-grade fever, which could be due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, respiratory failure, epistaxis, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for ulcer debridement and has been intubated due to respiratory failure. He has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and medications for his other medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about his acid-base balance and fluid status. The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels and abnormal renal function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening respiratory function.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function leading to fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
3. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, indicating a systemic infection. There is a risk of developing sepsis or septic shock if the infection spreads.
4. Wound infection: The patient underwent ulcer debridement, which increases the risk of wound infection.
5. Diabetes complications: The patient has uncontrolled diabetes, which puts him at risk for"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis.
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash added, protonix (can DC if
   extubated)
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Try PSV and wean down PEEP to 5 with goal of possible extubation
   today
   - Readdress goals of care, if no improvement in 1 day, wife may opt for
   terminal extubation with focus on comfort
   - Try to extubate
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Ultrafiltration had previously been slightly
   brisk, then stopped abruptly. Brisk volume off likely contributed to
   poor renal perfusion. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. Has been negative 2.4L.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Had had better pressures in the last few days in the
   context of diuresis. Continued to maintain pressures in the context of
   rapid taper of stress-dose steroids. Improved with resolution of
   bleeding and cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Likely primarily
   cardiogenic in nature. For the last two day the patient was in AF again
   and pressures are slightly lower
 typically in 110s on average.
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. Vascular not interested in intervention.
   - Continue increased Bactrim DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for
   poor PO absorption - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and
   enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - Check vanc trough today
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   - starting aspirin 81mg PO Daily (held due to recent severe ENT
   hemorrhage on [**2177-2-24**])
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -DC Fluconazole yesterday
   -f/u ID recs
   -f/u micro data
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Likely due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient
   is presently broadly covered.
   - Check C diff - negative
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, respiratory failure, epistaxis, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic renal failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU for ulcer debridement and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has developed a rash in dependent areas, which may be a drug rash. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and fever. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. Imaging reveals increased alveolar and interstitial markings in the right lung compared to the left, with some volume loss in the left lower lobe. Blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest a possible infection. The pending blood cultures will help determine the causative organism. Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic illnesses and medications, there is an increased risk of bacterial or fungal infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the underlying cause is not identified and treated promptly.

3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, which"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis. Given recent fevers however, would be
   concerned for VAP given change in sputum color, however sputum without
   microorganisms. Blood and urine cultures remain negative. Urine c/w
   UTI, however pt on broad spectrum [**Last Name (LF) 114**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] await culture.
   - F/u urine, blood, and sputum cx
   - F/u C diff tox
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash added, protonix (can DC if
   extubated)
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Try to wean off pressors prior to extubation although I suspect the
   pressors are needed for CVVH UF and positive intrathoracic pressure.
   - SBP, goal is to extubate today
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. LOS balance at 2L negative.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - will try to wean levophed after extubation
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Combination of UF, and positive pressure
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   - Wean off pressors
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Concern for infection given off of CVVH. However, also possibly due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient is presently
   broadly covered.
   - Panculture blood, urine, sputum, and c diff
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. Vascular not interested in intervention.
   - Continue increased Bactrim DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for
   poor PO absorption - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and
   enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - Check vanc trough today
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Ask ID about course of [**Month/Day (2) **] Rx
   - continuing aspirin 81mg PO Daily
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho

   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Stop PPI once extubated
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.4. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and severe peripheral vascular disease. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient experienced a code on 3/9 due to hypotension, then hypoxia, and finally bradycardia. He was successfully resuscitated but had a short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion. 

The patient is currently hypoxemic and in respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary edema, although pneumonia is less likely. His low-grade fever may be related to the continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) he is receiving. Blood and urine cultures remain negative, but there is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's volume overload is significant, and he is oliguric, likely requiring dialysis. His hypotension has improved with ultrafiltration during CVVH. 

Other issues include a low-grade temperature possibly related to CVVH, ventricular fibrillation arrest that has resolved, lower extremity ulcers with growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Enterobacter cloacae (all sensitive to Bactrim), and a yeast fungemia likely from a central line"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis. Given recent fevers however, would be
   concerned for VAP given change in sputum color, however sputum without
   microorganisms. Blood and urine cultures remain negative. Urine c/w
   UTI, however pt on broad spectrum [**Last Name (LF) 114**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] await culture.
   - F/u urine, blood, and sputum cx
   - F/u C diff tox
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash added, protonix (can DC if
   extubated)
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Try to wean off pressors prior to extubation although I suspect the
   pressors are needed for CVVH UF and positive intrathoracic pressure.
   - SBP, try to extubate today
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. LOS balance at 1.4L positive.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - will try to wean levophed to expedite
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Combination of UF, and positive pressure
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   - Wean off pressors
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Concern for infection given off of CVVH. However, also possibly due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient is presently
   broadly covered.
   - Panculture blood, urine, sputum, and c diff
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. Vascular not interested in intervention.
   - Continue increased Bactrim DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for
   poor PO absorption - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and
   enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - Check vanc trough today
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Ask ID about course of [**Month/Day (2) **] Rx
   - starting aspirin 81mg PO Daily (held due to recent severe ENT
   hemorrhage on [**2177-2-24**])
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line

   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, and severe peripheral vascular disease. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of a fibrillating heart. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. He has also been on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for fluid overload and acute renal failure.

The patient has had multiple codes and resuscitations, including one on 3/9/2177 in the setting of hypotension, then hypoxia, and finally bradycardia. He was successfully resuscitated, but experienced a short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion.

Plan:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The most likely cause is pulmonary edema, possibly secondary to volume overload. The patient's inspiratory force and hypoxia improved with diuresis. However, recent fevers raise concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Blood and urine cultures remain negative, and the sputum gram stain showed no microorganisms. It is recommended to follow up with urine, blood, and sputum cultures. Daily weaning trials and head-of-bed elevation should be continued. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) can be discontinued if extub"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Most likely [**1-7**] pulmonary edema, less likely PNA. Inspiratory force and
   hypoxia improved with diuresis. Given recent fevers however, would be
   concerned for VAP given change in sputum color, however sputum without
   microorganisms. Blood and urine cultures remain negative. Urine c/w
   UTI, however pt on broad spectrum [**Last Name (LF) 114**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] await culture.
   - F/u urine, blood, and sputum cx
   - F/u C diff tox
   - Daily weaning trials
   - HOB elevation, chlorhexadine oral wash added, protonix (can DC if
   extubated)
   - Continue diuresis with CVVH
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Try to wean off pressors prior to extubation although I suspect the
   pressors are needed for CVVH UF and positive intrathoracic pressure.
   - SBP, try to extubate today
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. LOS balance at 1.4L positive.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - will try to wean levophed to expedite
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Combination of UF, and positive pressure
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   - Wean off pressors
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Concern for infection given off of CVVH. However, also possibly due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient is presently
   broadly covered.
   - Panculture blood, urine, sputum, and c diff
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. Vascular not interested in intervention.
   - Continue increased Bactrim DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for
   poor PO absorption - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and
   enterobacter)
   - continue Bactrim (covering staph and stenotropo)
   - Check vanc trough today
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Ask ID about course of [**Month/Day (2) **] Rx
   - starting aspirin 81mg PO Daily (held due to recent severe ENT
   hemorrhage on [**2177-2-24**])
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)
   # Yeast fungemia

   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weight risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)

   Disposition: CCU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history including systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary edema or pneumonia, volume overload, hypotension, low-grade fever, ventricular fibrillation arrest, lower extremity ulcers, yeast fungemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute-on-chronic renal failure, tophaceous gout, ulcerative colitis, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus.

The plan of care includes managing hypoxemic respiratory failure with diuresis, weaning off pressors, elevating head of bed, and chlorhexidine oral wash. For volume overload, CVVH will be restarted with gentle goals off, aiming for ultrafiltration of 2-2.5L negative per day. Hypotension will be managed by weaning off pressors and adjusting CVVH. Low-grade fever will be evaluated with panculture blood, urine, sputum, and C. diff.

The patient's lower extremity ulcers are being treated with increased Bactrim and continued vancomycin/cefep"

   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Removed 3.7 L fluid yesterday via CVVH.   He is noticeable less
   edematous and is stable following extubation.  He still requires low
   dose pressors for hemodynamic support.  He still requires a 40% FIO2
   but is not dyspneic with a PaO2 = 115.   He has ongoing osteomyelitis
   from severe PVD and he is being followed by our vascular surgery
   colleagues and wound care specialists.
   Medical Decision Making
   We have achieved our main goal of extubation and will review the
   possibility of transitioning CVVR over to hemodiialysis as a long-term
   therapy.    We are in the process of reviewing with the patient and
   family ultimate treatment goals of a rehabilitation center and regular
   dialysis as a therapeutic goal.   His antibiotics will be given for a
   total of 6 weeks.   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3139**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5279**], MD

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of multiple comorbidities including systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/Pulm HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) complicated by multiple ulcerations, and hypothyroidism. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of fibrosis. The patient underwent intubation and required respiratory support. He has been experiencing hypotension, hypoxia, bradycardia, and altered mental status. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated creatinine levels, leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Blood cultures are pending. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient remains significantly fluid overloaded, which may contribute to further hypotension and potential complications such as pulmonary edema.
2. Hypotension: Despite improvements, the patient continues to experience hypotension, which could lead to organ perfusion issues and additional complications.
3. Hypoxia: The patient requires supplemental oxygen and continues to have episodes of hypoxia, possibly due to pulmonary edema and other factors.
4. Altered Mental Status:"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. LOS balance at 4L negative. But pt still significantly fluid
   overloaded with anasarca.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - will try to wean levophed today
   - Readdress goals of care on Monday
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Combination of UF, and positive pressure
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   - Wean off pressors
   # Hypoxia: Patient s/p successful extubation. Doing well requiring only
   40% FiO2 facemask. Cause of hypoxia is likely pulmonary edema, PNA less
   likely given lack of infiltrate, lack of sputum growth, fevers, or
   white count.
   - Continue UF with CVVH
   - Discuss with renal re long term goal whether pt is dialysis candidate
   # Altered mental status: Most consistent with ICU delirium. Steroid
   doses may be contributing, d/w pharmacy if this is equivalent to his
   maintainance dose of 20mg prednisone daily. Patient without active
   signs of infection including fevers, white count, and patient
   pan-cultures have been negative.
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull unnecessary lines
   - Bowel regimen
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Concern for infection given off of CVVH. However, also possibly due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient is presently
   broadly covered.
   - Panculture blood, urine, sputum, and c diff
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. Vascular not interested in intervention.
   - Bactrim 560mg IV Q6H as pt is NPO for now (covering staph and
   stenotropo), total 6 week course, last dose [**2177-4-14**]
   - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and enterobacter) total 6
   week course, last dose [**2177-4-14**]
   - Check vanc trough today
   - f/u blood cx results
   - continuing aspirin 81mg PO Daily
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -DC
d Fluconazole [**2177-3-12**]
   -f/u micro data
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Will need to continue PPI as pt is on steroids, will switch to po
   famotidine once pt can swallow
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.2. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weigh risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -continue CVVH
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   - Readjust dose to equal patient
s chronic prednisone 20mg PO daily
   dose
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and ulcerative colitis. The patient presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure, leading to respiratory failure requiring intubation. He was also hypotensive and required norepinephrine. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hypoxia, altered mental status, fever, and low-grade temperature. He has ongoing volume overload, hypotension, and requires continued ultrafiltration with CVVH. The patient's medical team plans to wean off pressors and address goals of care on Monday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient remains significantly fluid overloaded with anasarca. This could lead to further respiratory distress, worsening renal function, and cardiovascular complications.
2. Hypotension: Despite improvements, the patient may continue to experience hypotension due to ongoing fluid overload and poor forward flow. This could result in inadequate organ perfusion and increased risk of further renal failure or cardiovascular events.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to ICU delirium, steroids, or other factors. If left untreated, it could progress"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. LOS balance at 4L negative. But pt still significantly fluid
   overloaded with anasarca.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - will try to wean levophed today
   - Readdress goals of care on Monday
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Combination of UF, and positive pressure
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   - Wean off pressors
   # Hypoxia: Patient s/p successful extubation. Doing well requiring only
   40% FiO2 facemask. Cause of hypoxia is likely pulmonary edema, PNA less
   likely given lack of infiltrate, lack of sputum growth, fevers, or
   white count.
   - Continue UF with CVVH
   - Discuss with renal re long term goal whether pt is dialysis candidate
   # Altered mental status: Most consistent with ICU delirium. Steroid
   doses may be contributing, d/w pharmacy if this is equivalent to his
   maintainance dose of 20mg prednisone daily. Patient without active
   signs of infection including fevers, white count, and patient
   pan-cultures have been negative.
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull unnecessary lines
   - Bowel regimen
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Concern for infection given off of CVVH. However, also possibly due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient is presently
   broadly covered.
   - Panculture blood, urine, sputum, and c diff
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. Vascular not interested in intervention.
   - Bactrim 560mg IV Q6H as pt is NPO for now (covering staph and
   stenotropo)
   - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and enterobacter)
   - Check vanc trough today
   - f/u blood cx results
   - Ask ID about course of ABx Rx
   - continuing aspirin 81mg PO Daily
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -DC
d Fluconazole [**2177-3-12**]
   -f/u micro data
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Will need to continue PPI as pt is on steroids, will switch to po
   famotidine once pt can swallow
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.2. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weigh risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -continue CVVH
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

   Disposition: CCU
","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and hypothyroidism. He presents with massive fluid overload, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and respiratory failure following intubation. He has undergone several interventions, including continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), antibiotic therapy, and other supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient remains significantly fluid overloaded with anasarca. There is a need to restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100 cc/hr net negative might be reasonable) and continue ultrafiltration with a goal of 2-2.5L negative per day.
2. Hypotension: Although the patient's hypotension has improved, it is important to continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative fluid balance due to extravascular volume overload. Pressors should be weaned off, and the patient should continue to receive appropriate antibiotic coverage and increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H (per ID and pharmacist).
3. Hypoxia: The patient experienced hypoxia, which is likely pulmonary edema. Continuous ultrafiltration with CV"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, renal failure (acute and chronic), respiratory failure (acute), epistaxis, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. The patient presented to the ICU with a fever and was found to have an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. The patient's condition has deteriorated, leading to a decision to transition care towards comfort and not reintubate. The patient expressed his desire to communicate with his wife and stated that he does not want any further interventions at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, potentially leading to respiratory arrest.
2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an ongoing infection, which may progress to sepsis and septic shock if not appropriately managed.
3. Renal failure: The patient has both acute and chronic renal failure, putting him at risk for worsening renal function and fluid imbalance.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of heart failure and atrial fibrillation increases the risk of cardiac events, such as arrhythmias or heart failure exacerbation.
5. Gastrointestinal issues: The presence of ulcerative colitis and impaired skin integrity may predispose the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, ulcerative colitis, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, respiratory failure, epistaxis, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for debridement of a lower extremity ulcer. The patient has been on low-dose pressors, and his vital signs have been relatively stable. However, he has experienced episodes of fever and delirium. The patient's family has been informed about transitioning care towards comfort and not reintubating him. The patient's wishes are to communicate with his wife and not receive any active treatment at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease, impaired skin integrity, and recent debridement of an ulcer increases the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and local signs of inflammation, is crucial.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and his current condition suggests ongoing respiratory compromise. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels, respiratory rate, and gas exchange through arterial blood gas analysis is essential to detect any deterioration in respiratory function.

3. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. LOS balance at 2L negative.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - will try to wean levophed today
   - Pt expressing wishes to discontinue his level of care and go in
   peace, will request a palliative care consult today
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Combination of UF, and positive pressure
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   - Wean off pressors
   # Hypoxia: Patient s/p successful extubation. Doing well requiring only
   40% FiO2 facemask. Cause of hypoxia is likely pulmonary edema, PNA less
   likely given lack of infiltrate, lack of sputum growth, fevers, or
   white count.
   - Continue UF with CVVH
   - Discuss with renal re long term goal whether pt is dialysis candidate
   # Altered mental status: Most consistent with ICU delirium. Steroid
   doses may be contributing, d/w pharmacy if this is equivalent to his
   maintainance dose of 20mg prednisone daily. Patient without active
   signs of infection including fevers, white count, and patient
   pan-cultures have been negative.
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull unnecessary lines
   - Bowel regimen
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Concern for infection given off of CVVH. However, also possibly due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient is presently
   broadly covered.
   - Panculture blood, urine, sputum, and c diff
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and altered mental status. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient had a recent code on [**2177-3-9**] due to hypotension, then hypoxia, and bradycardia. He is now in respiratory failure post-intubation, with hypotension off pressors. He has been extubated and CVVH was stopped yesterday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient remains oliguric and likely to be dialysis dependent. There is a goal to restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (about 50-100 cc/hr net negative might be reasonable) and continue ultrafiltration with a goal of 2-2.5L negative per day.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved, but he still requires some positive pressure. It is planned to continue CVVH with some gentle goals for negative fluid balance, wean off pressors, and increase Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H due to concern for poor PO absorption.
3. Hypoxia: The patient successfully underwent extubation and is doing well on 40% FiO2 facemask. The cause of hypoxia is likely pulmonary edema, and the plan is to continue UF with CVVH and discuss with renal team long-term goals.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is consistent with ICU delirium. Steroid doses may be contributing, and it is planned to pull unnecessary lines, reorient the patient frequently, and consider a palliative care consult.
5. Low-grade temperature: The patient has a low-grade temperature possibly related to CVVH or the bear-hugger. Infection is a concern, and panculture blood, urine, sputum, and C. diff will be done.
6. Ventricular fibrillation arrest: The patient experienced a resolved ventricular fibrillation arrest that was likely due to volume overload causing hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary edema and hypoxia.
7. Lower extremity ulcers: The patient has growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to Bactrim. Vascular has been following and may recommend surgical debridement in the future.
8. Yeast fungemia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast, most likely from the central line. No endophthalmitis was noted per ophthalmology.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia possibly secondary to PPI. It is planned to continue PPI as the patient is on steroids, switch to po famotidine once the patient can swallow.
10. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy has improved, with INR now 1"

   Assessment:
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan:
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. LOS balance at 2L negative.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - will try to wean levophed today
   - Pt expressing wishes to discontinue his level of care and go in
   peace, will request a palliative care consult today
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Combination of UF, and positive pressure
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   - Wean off pressors
   # Hypoxia: Patient s/p successful extubation. Doing well requiring only
   40% FiO2 facemask. Cause of hypoxia is likely pulmonary edema, PNA less
   likely given lack of infiltrate, lack of sputum growth, fevers, or
   white count.
   - Continue UF with CVVH
   - Discuss with renal re long term goal whether pt is dialysis candidate
   # Altered mental status: Most consistent with ICU delirium. Steroid
   doses may be contributing, d/w pharmacy if this is equivalent to his
   maintainance dose of 20mg prednisone daily. Patient without active
   signs of infection including fevers, white count, and patient
   pan-cultures have been negative.
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull unnecessary lines
   - Bowel regimen
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Concern for infection given off of CVVH. However, also possibly due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient is presently
   broadly covered.
   - Panculture blood, urine, sputum, and c diff
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and multiple ulcerations. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient had a recent code on [**2177-3-9**] due to hypotension, then hypoxia, and finally bradycardia. He was successfully resuscitated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient has been diagnosed with fluid overload, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema, worsening heart failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, which can result in organ hypoperfusion and potential tissue damage. It is important to closely monitor and manage blood pressure to prevent further complications.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, and ongoing fluid overload may exacerbate renal function. Adequate renal support, such as dialysis, is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Infection: The patient has a low-grade fever, and there is a concern for infection, especially given the recent discontinuation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.
5. Ulcerative Colitis: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, which may require specific management, including medication adjustments or surgical intervention if necessary.
6. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient's severe peripheral vascular disease increases the risk of complications related to poor circulation, such as limb ischemia or gangrene.
7. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed to prevent hyperglycemia and its associated complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
8. Yeast Fungemia: The patient has a positive blood culture for yeast, indicating a fungal infection. Antifungal treatment should be initiated and continued until resolution.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current acute illness pose several potential complications that need to be closely monitored and managed."

   FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior study from [**2177-3-15**].
   Bilateral central venous catheter and feeding tube are unchanged in
   position. There is mild improvement of the airspace opacities since the
   previous study as well as within the interstitial markings consistent
   with fluid overload. There are more confluent areas of opacification in
   the left retrocardiac area. These areas have also improved somewhat.
   There are bilateral pleural effusions, left side worse than right.
   Microbiology: No new. C. diff negative
   ECG: .
   Assessment
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan
   # Volume Overload
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, and possibly cause
   of hypotension again today given cessation of CVVH. Unclear that this
   is the direct cause. Pt remains oliguric, will likely be dialysis
   dependent. LOS balance at 4L negative. But pt still significantly fluid
   overloaded with anasarca.
   - Restart CVVH today with gentle goals off (per Renal, but about 50-100
   cc/hr net negative might be reasonable)
   - Continue ultrafiltration with goal 2-2.5L negative per day
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - will try to wean levophed today
   - Readdress goals of care on Monday
   # Hypotension (stable hypotension, not related to event)
   Improved, broadly. Combination of UF, and positive pressure
   - Continue CVVH with some gentle goal for negative given extravascular
   volume overload.
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   - Wean off pressors
   # Hypoxia: Patient s/p successful extubation. Doing well requiring only
   40% FiO2 facemask. Cause of hypoxia is likely pulmonary edema, PNA less
   likely given lack of infiltrate, lack of sputum growth, fevers, or
   white count.
   - Continue UF with CVVH
   - Discuss with renal re long term goal whether pt is dialysis candidate
   # Altered mental status: Most consistent with ICU delirium. Steroid
   doses may be contributing, d/w pharmacy if this is equivalent to his
   maintainance dose of 20mg prednisone daily. Patient without active
   signs of infection including fevers, white count, and patient
   pan-cultures have been negative.
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull unnecessary lines
   - Bowel regimen
   # Low grade temp: In setting of CVVH.
   Concern for infection given off of CVVH. However, also possibly due to
bear-hugger
, but will keep infection in mind. Patient is presently
   broadly covered.
   - Panculture blood, urine, sputum, and c diff
   # V fib arrest: Resolved for now. Probably [**1-7**] volume overload causing
   hypotension from poor Frank-Starling physiology leading to pulmonary
   edema, hypoxia and leading to bradycardia.
   - Continue CVVH
   - Continue amiodarone PO
   # LE ulcers
   [**1-7**] bad PVD. Now growing STAPH AUREUS COAG +, STENOTROPHOMONAS
   (XANTHOMONAS) MALTOPH, and ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE all sensitive to
   bactrim. Vascular has been following, and may recommend surgical
   debridement in future. Vascular not interested in intervention.
   - Bactrim 560mg IV Q6H as pt is NPO for now (covering staph and
   stenotropo), total 6 week course, last dose [**2177-4-14**]
   - continue vanco/cefepime (covering staph and enterobacter) total 6
   week course, last dose [**2177-4-14**]
   - Check vanc trough today
   - f/u blood cx results
   - continuing aspirin 81mg PO Daily
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)
   # Yeast fungemia
   Noted on positive blood culture. Most likely source was central line
   (now resited).  No [**Female First Name (un) 444**] endophthalmitis per optho
   -DC
d Fluconazole [**2177-3-12**]
   -f/u micro data
   # Thrombocytopenia: possibly secondary to PPI.
   - Will need to continue PPI as pt is on steroids, will switch to po
   famotidine once pt can swallow
   # Coagulopathy: Improved, with INR now 1.2. Possibly nutrition related.
   -trend CBC, INR, PTT
   -holding off on further anticoagulation, consider pt
s recent bleeding
   problems on heparin gtt, despite AF (we weigh risk of stroke as lower
   than risk of catastrophic bleed).
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Renal failure likely prerenal. Cr
   stable at 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -continue CVVH
   -f/u renal recs
   -trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Tophaceous Gout: Diffuse tophi on exam.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis: On chronic steroids.
   - Steroid dose halved again today to 12.5 from 25 hydrocort (tapering
   down from stress-dosing)
   - Readjust dose to equal patient
s chronic prednisone 20mg PO daily
   dose
   # Hypothyroidism: continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal,
   total T4 low, but pt has been on amio (unsure if level was checked
   before or after it was started)
   - continue current dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history, including systolic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus type II, severe peripheral vascular disease, and multiple ulcerations. He was admitted to the ICU for ulcer debridement and later transferred due to heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been experiencing fluid overload, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, hypotension, hypoxia, altered mental status, low-grade temperature, and ventricular fibrillation arrest. He also has lower extremity ulcers infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter cloacae, and yeast fungemia. The patient's condition requires ongoing management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: The patient remains significantly fluid overloaded with anasarca, which may lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema, worsening heart failure, and renal dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: Despite improvements, the patient's hypotension could recur, potentially causing poor perfusion and organ damage.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory failure and pulmonary edema may continue to compromise oxygenation, leading to persistent hypoxia.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status, likely due to ICU delirium, could progress if not appropriately managed, potentially leading to worsening cognitive"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of renal and respiratory failure. He was admitted for ulcer debridement but was transferred to the CCU due to heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The patient is extubated now. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart failure (CHF), diastolic, acute on chronic: The patient's current condition suggests worsening heart failure. It is important to monitor his fluid balance, blood pressure, and symptoms of congestion such as shortness of breath or peripheral edema.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, which increases the risk of stroke and other cardiac complications. Monitoring his heart rhythm and providing appropriate antiarrhythmic medication or cardioversion may be necessary.
3. Renal failure, acute (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and managing fluid and electrolyte balance are crucial.
4. Respiratory failure, acute: Although the patient is extubated, there is evidence of bilateral pleural effusions and airspace opacities on the chest X-ray, indicating potential respiratory compromise. Monitoring his oxygenation status and respiratory effort is essential.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of an ulcer suggests impaired skin integrity. Proper wound care and prevention of further skin breakdown are necessary to prevent infection or other complications.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status requires"

   Imaging: CXR [**3-15**]
   HISTORY: 66-year-old man with renal and respiratory failure. Now
   extubated.
   FINDINGS: Comparison is made to prior study from [**2177-3-15**].
   Bilateral central venous catheter and feeding tube are unchanged in
   position. There is mild improvement of the airspace opacities since the
   previous study as well as within the interstitial markings consistent
   with fluid overload. There are more confluent areas of opacification in
   the left retrocardiac area. These areas have also improved somewhat.
   There are bilateral pleural effusions, left side worse than right.
   Microbiology: No new. C. diff negative
   ECG: .
   Assessment
   66 yo M with systolic CHF, OSA/Pulm HTN, CKD, DMII, severe PVD c/b
   multiple ulcerations presenting with massive fluid overload and acute
   on chronic renal failure in setting of a fib.  Now, in respiratory
   failure s/p intubation and with hypotension off pressors. Extubated and
   CVVH stopped yesterday. Recent code on [**2177-3-9**] in setting of
   hypotension, then hypoxia, then bradycardia. Successful resuscitation
   with short interval of hypotension and hypoperfusion, perhaps limited
   to 30 seconds.
   Plan
   # Volume Overload, Congestive Heart Failure and Acute Renal Failure
   Likely related to poor forward flow and hypotension, with now little
   perfusion of the kidneys. Markedly improved with CVVH.
   - CVVH to pause for filter change today, then continue with goal to
   have to dry weight now (now is even)
   - Given no likely recovery of renal function, will discuss again with
   family
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - Start PO midodrine 5 mg TID, will try to wean Levophed
   - Family meeting on Monday
   # Hypotension
   Has been somewhat hypotensive recently. Notably worse than when last
   extubated and off pressors, with unclear cause. Depending on goals of
   care may consider repeat echo.
   - Address goals of care, then consider echo
   - Check albumin
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease, Osteomyelitis and Leg Ulcers
   - continue vanc/cefepime, plus increased fluconazole 800 mg IV Q24H
   (per ID and pharm)
   - Increasing Bactrim to DS 3.5 TAB PO/NG Q6H given concern for poor PO
   absorption
   - Discuss with vascular after discussing overall plan with family
   - continuing aspirin 81mg PO Daily
   - Consider restarting Lipitor (was on Lipitor 80mg PO Daily)  although
   now quite myopathic, so will need to discuss
   # Hypoxia
   Resolved now while on CVVH. Major contributors were edema, plugging,
   +/- aspiration.
   # Altered Mental Status
   Now quite clear and continuing to improve.
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Pull unnecessary lines
   # Thrombocytopenia
   Possibly secondary to PPI or Bactrim.
   - Will need to continue PPI as pt is on steroids, will switch to po
   famotidine once pt can swallow
   # Tophaceous Gout
   Diffuse tophi on exam, worse at extremities.
   - continue renally adjusted dose of allopurinol
   - holding home colchicine for now
   - on steroids
   # Ulcerative colitis
   On chronic steroids.
   - Adjusted to equivalent to home dose, now at 10 mg PO QD
   # Hypothyroidism
   Continuing home dose of levothyoxine, TSH normal, total T4 low, but pt
   has been on amio (unsure if level was checked before or after it was
   started). Testing at this time likely to reflect illness rather than
   appropriateness of dose.
   - continue current dose

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of renal and respiratory failure, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea/pulmonary hypertension (OSA/PHTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus type II (DMII), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and multiple ulcerations. He presented with massive fluid overload and acute-on-chronic renal failure in the setting of atrial fibrillation (A. Fib.). The patient was intubated and placed on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to hypotension, hypoxia, and bradycardia. He successfully resuscitated but had a code on 3/9/2177 in the setting of hypotension, then hypoxia, followed by bradycardia.

The patient's current plan includes continuing CVVH after pausing for filter change today, aiming for dry weight now. Given no likely recovery of renal function, the medical team will discuss further with the family and consider renal recommendations. They also plan to start oral midodrine 5 mg three times a day to wean off levophed, and schedule a family meeting on Monday.

The patient's hypotension is being addressed, with consideration for a repeat echo depending on the goals of care. The medical team is also checking albumin levels. Regarding the patient's peripheral vascular disease, osteomyel"
