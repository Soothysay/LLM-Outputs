   This is a 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   who was admitted with pneumonia and s/p 10 day course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics being transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress.
   .
   1. HYPOXIA: Likely due to recurrent pna +/- flash pulm edema in setting
   of tachycardia.
   --BIPAP for as long as pt tolerating but won't need overnight
   --repeat ABG and assess clinical status
   --treat PNA with broader abx
   --careful monitoring of fluid status
   --chest PT when more stable
   .
   2. VOLUME STATUS/HYPOVOLEMIA: Hypovolemic in setting of overly
   aggressive diuresis.
   --gentle fluid boluses
   --try to make even very slowly
   --avoid any additional lasix for the time being
   --use improvement in tachycardia as guide
   --check another set of lyts Q6hrs
   .
   3.TACHYCARDIA: Likely related to hypovolemia,hypoxemia and significant
   work of breathing. Also, patient has known atrial tachycardia that has
   been controlled on metoprolol TID.
   --given lopressor 5mg IV x 2 with minimal improvement
   --250 cc fluid bolus x 2
   --if no improvement try dilt 10mg IV x 1
   --if still no improvement start dilt gtt
   --cont current PO dose of metoprolol
   .
   4. PNA: Concern for recurrent HAP.
   --broaden with [**Last Name (un) **] and cipro and vanc
   --repeat sputum sample
   .
   5. ?HIT: Positive HIT ab with negative SRA. Per Hematology he should
   stay on Lepirudin gtt
   --DC leparudin given potential procedures tonights
   --restart leparudin after procedures or when it is clear no procedures
   being done
   .
   6. Critical AS: AVR on hold given current situation and positive HIT.
   --f/u cardiac [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   --gentle fluid hydration
   --control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   .
   7. ARF: Likely pre-renal in setting of hypovolemia. Fluid resucitation
   as per above and f/u cr.
   --f/u cr
   --check urine lytes and osm

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and completed a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was then transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory distress. 

Based on the assessment and plan, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. HYPOXIA: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to recurrent pneumonia and/or flash pulmonary edema in the setting of tachycardia. The plan includes providing BiPAP, repeating arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, treating pneumonia with broader antibiotics, carefully monitoring fluid status, and performing chest X-ray when more stable.

2. VOLUME STATUS/HYPOVOLEMIA: The patient is hypovolemic due to overly aggressive diuresis. The plan involves gentle fluid boluses, avoiding additional lasix, monitoring improvement in tachycardia, and checking another set of labs every 6 hours.

3. TACHYCARDIA: The patient's tachycardia is likely related to hypovolemia, hypoxemia, and significant work of breathing. The plan includes administering lopressor IV, fluid boluses, trying diltiazem IV, starting diltiazem gtt, continuing current PO dose of metoprolol, and controlling tachycardia as per above to improve filling time.

   This is a 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   who was admitted with pneumonia and s/p 10 day course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics being transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress.
   .
   1. HYPOXIA: Likely due to mucus plugging, possible aspiration,  or +/-
   flash pulm edema in setting of tachycardia.  Required intubation as
   patient tired out.  Patient was bronched yesterday with no clear
   evidence of mucus plugging but positive for friable tissue in the
   setting of anticoagulation.  Patient now having blood tinged sputum.
   One witness aspiration event yesterday.  Due to delay to wean off
   sedation after bronch patient remained intubated overnight.
   --treat PNA with broader abx
   --careful monitoring of fluid status
   --chest PT when more stable
   --consider extubation today

   2. FEVER: Temp 101.3 this am.  Pan cultured.  Continue broad spectrum
   antibiotics.

   3. VOLUME STATUS/HYPOVOLEMIA: Hypovolemic in setting of overly
   aggressive diuresis.  Creatinine and hct increased overnight suggesting
   dehydration.
   --gentle fluid boluses
   --try to make even very slowly
   --avoid any additional lasix for the time being
   --use improvement in tachycardia as guide

   4.TACHYCARDIA: Likely related to hypovolemia,hypoxemia and significant
   work of breathing. Also, patient has known atrial tachycardia that has
   been controlled on metoprolol TID.
   --cont current PO dose of metoprolol
   --consider diltiazem gtt if poorly controlled heart rate
   .
   5. PNA: Concern for recurrent HAP.
   --broaden with  vanc
   --repeat sputum sample
   .
   6. ?HIT: Positive HIT ab with negative SRA. Per Hematology he should
   stay on Lepirudin gtt
   --Continue  leparudin
   -- follow up hematology recs

   --f/u cardiac [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs (per resident, bypass machine needed for
   surgery requires use of heparin)
   --gentle fluid hydration
   --control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and has been on a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory distress. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the assessment and plan include:

1. HYPOXIA: The patient's hypoxia may be due to mucus plugging, possible aspiration, or flash pulmonary edema in the setting of tachycardia. The patient required intubation as he became tired. It is important to treat pneumonia with broader antibiotics, carefully monitor fluid status, consider chest physiotherapy when more stable, and consider extubation today.

2. FEVER: The patient has a fever of 101.3 degrees Celsius this morning. He has been pan-cultured, indicating an ongoing infection. Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended.

3. VOLUME STATUS/HYPOVOLEMIA: The patient is hypovolemic due to overly aggressive diuresis. This is indicated by an increase in creatinine and hematocrit overnight, suggesting dehydration. Gentle fluid boluses, careful monitoring, and avoiding additional Lasix are advised.

4. TACHYCARDIA: The patient's tachycardia is likely related to hypovolemia, hypoxemia, and significant work of"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with pneumonia and completed a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with several significant events occurring within the past 24 hours. These events include:

1. Invasive ventilation - stopped at 12:22 PM and restarted at 11:13 PM.
2. Fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit.
3. Tachypnea with respiratory rate ranging from 40-50 breaths per minute.
4. ABG results indicating respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 480, pH 7.38, and PCO2 of 62 mmHg).
5. Chest X-ray showing right middle lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates, suggestive of pneumonia.
6. The patient developed bandemia, indicating a possible infection.
7. Mild hemoptysis was reported.
8. Atrial tachycardia with a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, treated with amiodarone.
9. Hypotension requiring vasopressor support with neosynephrine.
10. Renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
11. Electrolyte and fluid disorder.
12. Impaired skin integrity.

The patient's current diagnosis includes sepsis, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension (not shock), acute renal failure, other electrolyte and fluid disorders, pneumonia (likely aspiration), and impaired skin integrity.

The potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and further deterioration of renal function.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory results. The treatment plan involves broad-spectrum antibiotics, source control measures, hemodynamic support, and renal dose adjustment of medications. Additionally, the patient's critical aortic stenosis and upcoming AVR surgery need to be addressed, taking into consideration the positive HIT and need for heparin during the procedure."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted with pneumonia and had been on a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory distress, along with a new bandemia and high fever. The patient's condition is concerning for a new infection versus HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). He was previously on vanc / zosyn but was broadened to vanc / meropenem / cipro due to suspected aspiration pneumonia, which should be treated as ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient also has stage II decubitus ulcer and is experiencing sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte & fluid disorder, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, atrial tachycardia, and possible HIT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and bandemia, indicating a possible infection. It is crucial to continue broadened antibiotics and monitor fever curve, WBC, and bandemia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was reintubated last night for respiratory distress. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), such as rebronchial patient with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) and CT chest/abdomen.
3. Renal failure: The patient has worsening creatinine levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and completed a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient's current conditions include sepsis, respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever spike to 103F and new bandemia indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and elevated respiratory rate suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and oxygen support may be required.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (84/50 mmHg) indicates hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, fluid overload, or cardiac dysfunction. Inotropic support and fluid management are necessary.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's worsening creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, possibly secondary to sepsis and renal hypoperfusion. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
5. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium, indicating an electrolyte disorder. Frequent lab monitoring and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement. He presented with pneumonia and is now experiencing respiratory failure and sepsis. He has been extubated multiple times due to somnolence and reintubated due to tachypnea. The patient has developed fever, hemoptysis, hematuria, atrial tachycardia, and has shown worsening respiratory and hemodynamic status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, bandemia, and symptoms of infection indicate sepsis. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's repeated intubations and prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. This would require adjustment of antibiotics and possibly bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage for diagnosis and treatment.
3. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient has a history of heparin exposure, and his low platelet count may suggest HIT. This condition can increase the risk of thrombosis and requires appropriate management with alternative anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement. He initially presented with pneumonia and is now experiencing respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient has been extubated multiple times due to somnolence but was reintubated due to continued tachypnea. He has developed fever, hemoptysis, and hematuria. His atrial tachycardia was successfully managed with amiodarone, but he remains on BiPAP and has required reintubation. The patient appears hypervolemic and has evidence of renal dysfunction. There are concerns about possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and occult infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and bandemia suggest an ongoing infection, which may lead to sepsis. It is crucial to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's progression of infiltrates on chest X-ray, hemoptysis, and hematuria raise concerns for VAP. Repeating bronchoscopy and changing antibiotics may be necessary.
3. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's low platelet count and history of heparin exposure raise the possibility of HIT. Further investigation, including cardiac enzymes and upper and lower extrem"

   This is a 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   who was admitted with pneumonia and s/p 10 day course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress with new bandemia and high fever, with concern for new
   infection vs HIT.
   # Sepsis: the patient respiked to 103F and has a new bandemia in the
   setting of respiratory distress and likely new RML and RLL infiltrate,
   likely an aspiration pneumonia which should be treated as ventilator
   associated pneumonia.  Also could be febrile response from HIT with
   re-exposure to heparin flush. No spike in LFTs, although bili slightly
   increased. Patient also with Stage II decubitus ulcer. The patient was
   on vanc / zosyn at this time so was broadened to vanc / [**Last Name (un) **] / cipro.
   - continue broadened antibiotics
   - CT chest/abdomen done yesterday showed worsening multifocal PNA and
   larger right pleural effusion, tap right effusion if difficulty weaning
   from vent
   - send stool for cdiff, pending
   -f/u blood / urine cultures
   -monitor fever curve / WBC and bandemia=
   -pressor switched to levophed from neosynephrine given resolution of
   atrial tachycardia, CVP is > 12, CVO2 is 59 but hct is already > 30 and
   given atrial tachycardia augmenting with dobutamine may be difficult,
   continue to wean off levophed
   -set up vigelo for better hemodynamic monitoring

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted with pneumonia and completed a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was then transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory distress, along with a new bandemia and high fever. The main medical complications that can arise based on the progress note are as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient experienced a spike in temperature and developed a new bandemia, indicating a possible new infection. This should be treated as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's immune system may be weakened due to the ongoing antibiotics and other factors, increasing the risk of sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient required reintubation for respiratory distress and has new infiltrates consistent with VAP. However, it could also be due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, abscess, or fungal infection. The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further if not properly managed.

3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient has persistent low blood pressure, which may be related to sepsis or renal failure. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.

4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible acute renal failure. Sepsis, hypotension, and other factors may contribute to renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia and subsequently transferred to the MICU due to hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing high fever and a new bandemia, suggesting a new infection or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient also has respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and bandemia indicate a possible infection. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for any worsening of symptoms.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been reintubated for respiratory distress and has new infiltrates consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Further evaluation and treatment for VAP should be initiated.
3. HIT: The patient has tested positive for HIT with negative SRA. Lepirudin gtt should be continued, and discussion with hematology should be pursued.
4. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing atrial tachycardia, which may require conversion to PO amiodarone regimen when more stable.
5. Critical AS/Systolic CHF: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and systolic CHF require evaluation by cardiac surgery. AVR may need to be postponed due to positive HIT.

   This is a 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   who was admitted with pneumonia and s/p 10 day course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress with new bandemia and high fever, with concern for new
   infection vs HIT.
   # Sepsis: the patient respiked to 103F and has a new bandemia in the
   setting of respiratory distress and likely new RML and RLL infiltrate,
   likely an aspiration pneumonia which should be treated as ventilator
   associated pneumonia.  Also could be febrile response from HIT with
   re-exposure to heparin flush. No spike in LFTs, although bili slightly
   increased. Patient also with Stage II decubitus ulcer. The patient was
   on vanc / zosyn at this time so was broadened to vanc / [**Last Name (un) **] / cipro.
   - continue broadened antibiotics
   - CT chest/abdomen done yesterday showed worsening multifocal PNA and
   larger right pleural effusion, tap right effusion if difficulty weaning
   from vent
   - send stool for cdiff, pending
   -f/u blood / urine cultures

   -pressor switched to levophed from neosynephrine given resolution of
   atrial tachycardia, CVP is > 12, CVO2 is 59 but hct is already > 30 and
   given atrial tachycardia augmenting with dobutamine may be difficult,
   continue to wean off levophed
   -set up vigelo for better hemodynamic monitoring
   # Respiratory failure: Patient reintubated last night for respiratory
   distress. Also with new infiltrate consistent with VAP but could be
   diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, other abcess/fungal infection.
   - continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro
   - rebronched yesterday with BAL sent, f/u cx data, nothing growing to
   guide abx thus far
   - continue mechanical intubation
   # ?HIT: Positive HIT ab with negative SRA. Per Hematology he should
   stay on Lepirudin gtt, need to rediscuss with heme given hemoptysis and
   hematuria.  Lepirudin had been stopped in the setting of respiratory
   compromise and hemoptysis.
   - Talk to heme regarding possibility of HIT, they will see him today
   - LENIs and upper extremity US were negative for DVT

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted with pneumonia and subsequently transferred to the MICU due to hypoxia and respiratory distress. He has been experiencing a high fever and new bandemia, raising concerns for a new infection or HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever spike and new bandemia suggest sepsis, likely caused by aspiration pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the treatment plan should be continued and adjusted based on culture results.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient required reintubation for respiratory distress, and a new infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggests VAP. Other potential causes such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, abscess, or fungal infection should also be considered. Mechanical intubation should be continued, and the current antibiotic regimen should be continued while awaiting further diagnostic information.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is a concern, particularly if it is due to septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters is necessary. Vasopressor support may be required.

4. Renal failure: The patient's worsening creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, likely related to sepsis and renal hypoperfusion. Renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be adjusted accordingly"

The patient has a high fever and bandemia, indicating a possible new infection or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of respiratory distress and likely new right middle lobe (RML) and right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrates, which could indicate aspiration pneumonia. This suggests the possibility of sepsis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been reintubated due to respiratory distress, and there is a new infiltrate consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Other possibilities include diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, abscess, or fungal infection.

3. HIT: The patient has tested positive for HIT antibodies but negative for serotonin release assay (SRA). Hematology has advised continuing Lepirudin drip, but this needs to be discussed further given the patient's hemoptysis and hematuria.

4. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of atrial tachycardia, likely triggered by hypoxia. Amiodarone drip has been initiated, and when the patient is more stable, conversion to oral amiodar"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   who was admitted with pneumonia and s/p 10 day course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress with new bandemia and high fever, with concern for new
   infection vs HIT.
   # VAP: RML and RLL infiltrate, likely an aspiration pneumonia. Consider
   fungal infection, though less likely - .  Fever curve trending down,
   WBC improved off antifungals. Other potential sources include decub,
   less likely C diff. Line has been pulled. No evidence of peripheral
   clots on recent ultrasounds.
   - continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro for now.
   - consider tapping pleural effusion
   - f/u pending micro including BAL
   - repeat blood and urine cx, stool C diff
   - consider checking glucan/galactomannan if no significant improvement
   though note pt recently on zosyn
   # Septic shock
   Suspect pulmonary source, as above.
   - Change back to neo today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS
   .
   # atrial tachycardia:
   triggered by hypoxia, > 50% of time in the ICU has been in atrial
   tachycardia, when more stable convert to PO amio regimen
   - Start PO amiodarone

   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - readdress with cardiac surgery. ?role for valvuloplasty
   - check cardiac enzymes
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   - volume goal even
   # ?HIT:
   Felt unlikely on rediscussion with heme
   - will discuss further with heme
   #. ARF:
   Cr slightly improved today
   - trend cr and monitor UOP

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia. He has been in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of bandemia, high fever, and concern for new infection or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). His recent investigations show worsening multifocal pneumonia, increased right pleural effusion, and a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has been weaned off levophed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has RML and RLL infiltrates, likely indicating aspiration pneumonia. This suggests the possibility of VAP, and further investigations are needed to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Sepsis/Septic shock: The patient is suspected to have septic shock, possibly due to a pulmonary source. Appropriate antibiotics and supportive care are necessary.
3. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has been in atrial tachycardia for more than 50% of the time in the ICU. Conversion to PO amiodarone regimen is planned.
4. Critical AS/systolic CHF: The patient's AVR has been on hold due to infection and question of HIT. Cardiac surgery will need to be re"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M critical AS, persistent R-sided pneumonia, ? HIT, now with
   hemodynamic collapse c/w sepsis
   1. Sepsis: progression of pneumonia vs occult infection
    - ct abdomen wnl
    - chest CT with progression of L-sided pneumonia
    - blood, urine, sputum cultures pending
    - will continue blood pressure support (pt with similar response to
   both neosynephrine and levophed)
    - he appears euvolemic and will therefore aim for TBB even for right
   now, IVF bolus if necessary
   2. Respiratory failure: VAP and effusion
    - will hold off on tapping effusion as this is likely not effecting
   overall respiratory status
    - continues to have hematemesis
    - will give Vit K, hold off on DIC
   3. Atrial tachycardia:
    - cont PO amiodarone to slow heart rate
   4. Critical AS:
    - will touch base with CV [**Doctor First Name 91**] regarding possibility of valvuloplasty
   as bridge towards eventual surgery when stable
   5. Coagulopathy:
    - ? dic vs nutrition vs lepirudin effects
    - vit K
    - continue to f/u with hematology regarding possibility of HIT but
   appears to be low likelihood, and therefore holding lepirudiin
   especially in setting of ongoing bleed/ooze
   6. Nutrition: will start tube feeds today

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M critical AS, persistent R-sided pneumonia, ? HIT, now with
   hemodynamic collapse c/w sepsis
   1. Sepsis: progression of pneumonia vs occult infection
    - ct abdomen wnl
    - chest CT with progression of L-sided pneumonia
    - blood, urine, sputum [**Year (4 digits) 6462**] pending
    - will continue blood pressure support (pt with similar response to
   both neosynephrine and levophed)
    - he appears euvolemic and will therefore aim for TBB even for right
   now, IVF bolus if necessary
   2. Respiratory failure: VAP and effusion
    - will hold off on tapping effusion as this is likely not effecting
   overall respiratory status
    - continues to have hematemesis
    - will give Vit K, hold off on DIC
   3. Atrial tachycardia:
    - cont PO amiodarone to slow heart rate
   4. Critical AS:
    - will touch base with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] regarding possibility of valvuloplasty
   as bridge towards eventual surgery
   5. Coagulopathy:
    - ? dic vs nutrition vs lepirudin effects
    - vit K
    - continue to f/u with hematology regarding possibility of HIT but
   appears to be low likelihood, and therefore holding lepirudiin
   especially in setting of ongoing bleed/ooze

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis (AS) and persistent right-sided pneumonia. The patient has experienced hemodynamic collapse consistent with sepsis. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's progression of pneumonia and possible occult infection may lead to sepsis. The assessment indicates ongoing blood pressure support and aiming for target blood volume (TBB) management.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and increased right-sided pleural effusion. There is a plan to hold off on tapping the effusion as it is not affecting the overall respiratory status.

3. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has an atrial tachycardia, and amiodarone is being continued to slow the heart rate.

4. Critical AS: The patient has critical AS, and there is a discussion regarding the possibility of valvuloplasty as a bridge towards eventual surgery.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient may have a coagulopathy due to various factors such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), malnutrition, or lepirudin effects. Vit K has been given, and the use of lepirudin is being reconsidered due to ongoing bleeding.

6. Nutrition: The patient will start tube feeds today to address nutritional concerns.

It is important to monitor"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   who was admitted with pneumonia and s/p 10 day course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress with new bandemia and high fever, with concern for new
   infection vs HIT.
   # VAP: RML and RLL infiltrate, likely an aspiration pneumonia. Consider
   fungal infection, though less likely - .  Fever curve trending down,
   WBC improved off antifungals. Other potential sources include decub,
   less likely C diff. Line has been pulled. No evidence of peripheral
   clots on recent ultrasounds.
   - continue vanc (d1=[**4-7**], today d6),  [**Last Name (un) **] (d1=[**4-9**], today d4), cipro
   (d1=[**4-9**], today d4)
   - consider tapping pleural effusion
   - f/u pending micro including BAL
   - repeat blood and urine cx, stool C diff
   - consider checking glucan/galactomannan if no significant improvement
   though note pt recently on zosyn so may be false po
   # Hypotension
   Likely due to sepsis with pulmonary source, as above. Lactates have
   trended down. Baseline critical AS
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - readdress with cardiac surgery. ?role for valvuloplasty
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   - volume goal -500 to 1L as tolerated by pressure
   # ?HIT:
   Felt unlikely on rediscussion with heme, though unable to completely
   rule out at this time
   - repeat PF4
   - continue to hold lepirudin
   - will discuss further with heme
   # atrial tachycardia:
   triggered by hypoxia, > 50% of time in the ICU has been in atrial
   tachycardia, when more stable convert to PO amio regimen
   - continue PO amiodarone
   #. ARF:
   Cr slightly improved today
   - trend cr and monitor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   # Coagulapathy
   DDx include DIC, antibiotics, poor nutrition. INR mildly improved after
   vitamin K.
   - hold on FFP for now.
   - check fibrinogen
   .
   # Volume status- will plan to diuresed with lasix gtt, goal 500 to
   1000cc negative

   above.
   Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 530**] continues to need low dose levophed for BP support but UO has
   been good and lactates responsive to ongoing rescucitation. He has
   excellent oxygenation despite worsening effusions on CXR. We will
   attempt diuresis with lasix infusion today ( with levophed support) and
   if possible transition to CPAP/ PSV in 48 hrs provided there is no
   further hemoptysis. If he is unable to do so, thoracentesis will be
   performed on Rt effusion. We will also address possibility of Aortic
   valvuloplasty by CV surgical team.
   HIT workup ongoing.

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and received a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with hypoxia and respiratory distress, along with a high fever and concern for a new infection or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's current conditions include pneumonia with right middle and lower lobe infiltrates, likely aspiration pneumonia; hypotension likely due to sepsis with a pulmonary source; critical aortic stenosis/systolic heart failure; possible HIT; atrial tachycardia; acute renal failure; and coagulopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of septic shock, further deterioration of renal function, progression of heart failure, and the possibility of bleeding or thrombosis related to HIT. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, oxygenation, fluid status, and laboratory values will be crucial in managing these conditions. The patient's care plan includes continuing vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem antibiotics, considering pleural effusion tapping, repeating blood and urine cultures, checking for fungal infection, and discussing the possibility of valvuloplasty with the cardiac surgery team."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and completed a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was then transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory distress, presenting with new bandemia and high fever. There is concern for a new infection or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has RML and RLL infiltrates, likely indicating aspiration pneumonia. Fungal infection is also a possibility, although less likely. The fever curve is trending down, and the WBC count has improved off antifungals. Other potential sources of infection include decubitus ulcers and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). A line has been pulled, and there is no evidence of peripheral clots on recent ultrasounds.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis with a pulmonary source, as indicated by the above information. Lactates have trended down, indicating some improvement. The patient's critical aortic stenosis may also contribute to hypotension.

3. Critical AS/systolic CHF: The patient's AVR has been on hold due to infection and the question of HIT. Readdressing cardiac surgery and considering valvuloplasty should be"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and received a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory distress, along with a new bandemia and high fever. The concern is for a new infection or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Assessment and Plan:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has right middle lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates, likely indicating aspiration pneumonia. There is a possibility of fungal infection, although less likely. The fever curve is trending down, and the white blood cell (WBC) count has improved off antifungals. Other potential sources of infection include decubitus ulcers and Clostridium difficile. The central line has been removed, and no evidence of peripheral clots was found on recent ultrasounds.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to sepsis with a pulmonary source, as mentioned earlier. Lactates have trended down, indicating some improvement.

3. Critical AS/systolic CHF: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and systolic heart failure have been on hold due to the infection and question of HIT. It is recommended to readdress with cardiac surgery, considering the role of"

   This is a 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   who was admitted with pneumonia and s/p 10 day course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress with new bandemia and high fever, with concern for new
   infection vs HIT.
   # VAP: RML and RLL infiltrate, likely an aspiration pneumonia. Consider
   fungal infection, though less likely - .  Fever curve trending down,
   WBC improved off antifungals. Other potential sources include decub,
   less likely C diff. Line has been pulled. No evidence of peripheral
   clots on recent ultrasounds.
   - continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro for now.
   - consider tapping pleural effusion
   - f/u pending micro including BAL
   - repeat blood and urine cx, stool C diff
   - consider checking glucan/galactomannan if no significant improvement
   though note pt recently on zosyn
   # Septic shock
   Suspect pulmonary source, as above.
   - Change back to neo today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS
   .
   # atrial tachycardia:
   triggered by hypoxia, > 50% of time in the ICU has been in atrial
   tachycardia, when more stable convert to PO amio regimen
   - Start PO amiodarone
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - readdress with cardiac surgery. ?role for valvuloplasty
   - check cardiac enzymes
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   - volume goal even
   # ?HIT:
   Felt unlikely on rediscussion with heme
   - will discuss further with heme
   #. ARF:
   Cr slightly improved today
   - trend cr and monitor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   # Coagulapathy
   DDx include DIC, antibiotics, poor nutrition
   - hold on FFP for now. Will give trial of vitamin K 5mg
   - check fibrinogen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient has a fever, tachycardia, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, electrolyte/fluid disorder, and impaired skin integrity.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high fever, tachycardia, and signs of infection, which suggest the possibility of sepsis. Prompt treatment is necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia. This condition requires immediate intervention to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has signs of acute renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are essential to prevent further deterioration.

4. Electrolyte/Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid balance are disturbed, as shown by the abnormal laboratory values. Correction of these imbalances is crucial to maintain proper organ function.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and other skin infections. Proper skin care and repositioning are necessary to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   who was admitted with pneumonia and s/p 10 day course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress with new bandemia and high fever, with concern for new
   infection vs HIT.
   # VAP: RML and RLL infiltrate, likely an aspiration pneumonia. Consider
   fungal infection, though less likely - .  Fever curve trending down,
   WBC improved off antifungals. Other potential sources include decub,
   less likely C diff. Line has been pulled. No evidence of peripheral
   clots on recent ultrasounds.
   - continue vanc (d1=[**4-7**], today d6),  [**Last Name (un) **] (d1=[**4-9**], today d4), cipro
   (d1=[**4-9**], today d4)
   - consider tapping pleural effusion
   - f/u pending micro including BAL
   - repeat blood and urine cx, stool C diff
   - consider checking glucan/galactomannan if no significant improvement
   though note pt recently on zosyn so may be false po
   # Septic shock
   Suspect pulmonary source, as above.
   - Change back to neo today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS
   .
   # atrial tachycardia:
   triggered by hypoxia, > 50% of time in the ICU has been in atrial
   tachycardia, when more stable convert to PO amio regimen
   - Start PO amiodarone
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - readdress with cardiac surgery. ?role for valvuloplasty
   - check cardiac enzymes
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   - volume goal even
   # ?HIT:
   Felt unlikely on rediscussion with heme
   - will discuss further with heme
   #. ARF:
   Cr slightly improved today
   - trend cr and monitor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   # Coagulapathy
   DDx include DIC, antibiotics, poor nutrition
   - hold on FFP for now. Will give trial of vitamin K 5mg
   - check fibrinogen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and underwent a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with hypoxia and respiratory distress, along with a new bandemia and high fever. There is concern for a new infection versus heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents and thrombocytopenia. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin on 04/09/2130 at 06:09 PM. The patient is currently on multiple infusions, including propofol and norepinephrine.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1 F (38.4 C), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 82/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is 72.7 kg, and height is 69 inches.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 79 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The"

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents and thrombocytopenia. 

24-hour events include fever with a temperature of 101.1Â°F, heme recommended to resend PF4 test due to low platelet count, holding valve procedure until infection and respiratory status are more stabilized, switching to PO amiodarone, administering a 250ml bolus for decreased urine output, starting tube feeds, and monitoring lactate levels which fluctuated between 1.7 and 2.1. 

Infusions include propofol at 10 mcg/kg/min and norepinephrine at 0.19 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include morphine sulfate. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82/56 mmHg to 100/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature ranging from 37.8Â°C to 100.1Â°F.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   who was admitted with pneumonia and s/p 10 day course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress with new bandemia and high fever, with concern for new
   infection vs HIT.
   # VAP: RML and RLL infiltrate, likely an aspiration pneumonia. Consider
   fungal infection, though less likely - .  Fever curve trending down,
   WBC improved off antifungals. Other potential sources include decub,
   less likely C diff. Line has been pulled. No evidence of peripheral
   clots on recent ultrasounds.
   - continue vanc (d1=[**4-7**], today d6),  [**Last Name (un) **] (d1=[**4-9**], today d4), cipro
   (d1=[**4-9**], today d4)
   - consider tapping pleural effusion
   - f/u pending micro including BAL
   - repeat blood and urine cx, stool C diff
   - consider checking glucan/galactomannan if no significant improvement
   though note pt recently on zosyn so may be false po
   # Hypotension
   Likely due to sepsis with pulmonary source, as above. Lactates have
   trended down. Baseline critical AS
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - readdress with cardiac surgery. ?role for valvuloplasty
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   - volume goal -500 to 1L as tolerated by pressure
   # ?HIT:
   Felt unlikely on rediscussion with heme, though unable to completely
   rule out at this time
   - repeat PF4
   - continue to hold lepirudin
   - will discuss further with heme
   # atrial tachycardia:
   triggered by hypoxia, > 50% of time in the ICU has been in atrial
   tachycardia, when more stable convert to PO amio regimen
   - continue PO amiodarone
   #. ARF:
   Cr slightly improved today
   - trend cr and monitor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   # Coagulapathy
   DDx include DIC, antibiotics, poor nutrition. INR mildly improved after
   vitamin K.
   - hold on FFP for now.
   - check fibrinogen
   .
   # Volume status- will plan to diuresed with lasix gtt, goal 500 to
   1000cc negative

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and completed a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was then transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory distress, along with a new bandemia and high fever, raising concerns for new infection versus heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 7 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and spontaneous respiratory efforts are absent.

2. Hemodynamic Monitoring: The patient has an arterial line in place for continuous blood pressure monitoring and central venous pressure (CVP) measurement.

3. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a total of 3,172 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 2,180 mL through the urine and 992 mL of balance.

4. Laboratory Results: The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.7 K/uL, elevated troponin-T levels, increased lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   who was admitted with pneumonia and s/p 10 day course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress still intubated, on pressors, being treated for VAP/aspiration
   PNA.
   # VAP: RML and RLL infiltrate, likely an aspiration pneumonia. Consider
   fungal infection, though less likely - .  Fever curve trending down but
   has new increased leukocytosis overnight. Other potential sources
   include decub, less likely C diff. Line has been pulled. No evidence of
   peripheral clots on recent ultrasounds. Oxygenation stable.
   - continue vanc (d1=[**4-7**], today d7),  [**Last Name (un) **] (d1=[**4-9**], today d5), cipro
   (d1=[**4-9**], today d5), complete 10 day course
   - consider tapping pleural effusion
   - f/u pending micro including BAL
   - repeat blood and urine cx, stool C diff
   - consider checking glucan/galactomannan if no significant improvement
   though note pt recently on zosyn so may be false po
   # Hypotension
   Likely due to sepsis with pulmonary source, as above. Lactates have
   trended down. Baseline critical AS. Have started gentle diuresis with
   lasix gtt overnight. Has had good UOP
   - Keep on levophed with goal diuresis 1L out/24hrs, keeping MAP>65
   - Follow urine output, MAPS
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - readdress with cardiac surgery. ?role for valvuloplasty
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   - lasix gtt with goal UOP 100cc/hr, goal -1L out overnight
   - PM lytes with diuresis
   # ?HIT:
   Felt unlikely on rediscussion with heme, though unable to completely
   rule out at this time. Repeat PF4 mildly elevated.
   - heme recs appreciated
 get thoughts on HIT in context of cardiac
   surgery
   - continue to hold lepirudin
   # atrial tachycardia:
   triggered by hypoxia, > 50% of time in the ICU has been in atrial
   tachycardia, has been converted to PO amiodarone
   - continue PO amiodarone
   - can back off on diuresis if tachycardia increased
   #. ARF:
   Cr stable
   - trend cr and monitor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   # Coagulapathy
   DDx include DIC, antibiotics, poor nutrition. INR mildly improved after
   vitamin K.
   - hold on FFP for now.
   - check fibrinogen
   .
   # Volume status- will plan to diuresed with lasix gtt, goal 500 to
   1000cc negative

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was then transferred to the MICU due to hypoxia and respiratory distress, still intubated and on pressors. The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.1Â°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 107/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a first-degree AV block.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.7 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels, elevated lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated lipase levels, and low platelet count. The patient's creatinine levels are stable.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including:
1. VAP: The patient has right middle and lower lobe infiltrates, likely due to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis with a pulmonary source. Lactate levels have trended down, but the patient remains hypotensive. Diuretics have been started to manage fluid balance.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia and is currently in the ICU. He has been intubated, on pressors, and being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has hypotension likely due to sepsis, critical AS/systolic CHF, possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), atrial tachycardia, acute renal failure (ARF), and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate management of fluid and vasopressor therapy are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
2. Critical AS/systolic CHF: The patient's critical aortic stenosis with systolic heart failure can worsen over time, leading to further cardiac dysfunction. It is important to optimize medical management and consider timing for aortic valve replacement (AVR).
3. Possible HIT: The patient has an elevated PF4 level, which raises suspicion for HIT. If confirmed, it may necessitate the use of alternative anticoagulation and potential surgical intervention adjustments.
4. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing frequent episodes of atrial tachycardia, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and other complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who presented with pneumonia and septic shock while awaiting aortic valve repair. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia and possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HITT). The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to likely hemorrhagic pneumonia, new-onset white blood cells with low-grade temperature, hypotension of unknown etiology, and atrial tachycardia. The patient's condition requires critical care support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a right-sided pleural effusion, which may impact his respiratory status.
2. Infection: The patient has new-onset white blood cells and low-grade temperature, indicating a possible infection. Further investigation and reculture of blood, urine, and sputum (bronchoalveolar lavage) are recommended.
3. Hypotension of unknown etiology (HoTN): The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation. The cause of HoTN is likely sepsis on top of poor cardiac output related to critical aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation.
4. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has developed atrial tachycardia, which needs to be closely monitored. Amiodarone will be continued, and the holding of lop"

- The patient's hospital course has been complicated by aspiration pneumonia and possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HITT).
- The patient is currently in respiratory failure due to likely hemorrhagic pneumonia on the right side. A pleural effusion is present but not impacting respiratory status.
- The patient has a new white blood cell count with low-grade temperature, and cultures have been ordered for blood, urine, sputum (bronchoalveolar lavage), and stool for Clostridium difficile.
- The patient is experiencing hypotension due to sepsis on top of poor cardiac output related to critical aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation. Levophed is being continued for blood pressure support with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of greater than 65.
- The patient also has atrial tachycardia, for which amiodarone is being continued, and lopressor is being held. Close monitoring of volume status is ongoing.
- The likelihood of HITT is low, so lepirudin is being held, and repeat platelet function testing (PF4) is negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 79 year old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR
   who was admitted with pneumonia and s/p 10 day course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress still intubated, on pressors, being treated for VAP/aspiration
   PNA.
   # VAP: RML and RLL infiltrate, likely an aspiration pneumonia. Consider
   fungal infection, though less likely - .  Fever curve trending down but
   has new increased leukocytosis overnight. Other potential sources
   include decub, less likely C diff. Line has been pulled. No evidence of
   peripheral clots on recent ultrasounds. Oxygenation stable.
   - continue vanc (d1=[**4-7**], today d7),  [**Last Name (un) **] (d1=[**4-9**], today d5), cipro
   (d1=[**4-9**], today d5), complete 10 day course
   - consider tapping pleural effusion
   - f/u pending micro including BAL
   - repeat blood and urine cx, stool C diff
   - consider checking glucan/galactomannan if no significant improvement
   though note pt recently on zosyn so may be false po
   # Hypotension
   Likely due to sepsis with pulmonary source, as above. Lactates have
   trended down. Baseline critical AS. Have started gentle diuresis with
   lasix gtt overnight. Has had good UOP
   - Keep on levophed with goal diuresis 1L out/24hrs, keeping MAP>65
   - Follow urine output, MAPS
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - readdress with cardiac surgery. ?role for valvuloplasty
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   - lasix gtt with goal UOP 100cc/hr, goal -1L out overnight
   - PM lytes with diuresis
   # ?HIT:
   Felt unlikely on rediscussion with heme, though unable to completely
   rule out at this time. Repeat PF4 mildly elevated.
   - heme recs appreciated
 get thoughts on HIT in context of cardiac
   surgery
   - continue to hold lepirudin
   # atrial tachycardia:
   triggered by hypoxia, > 50% of time in the ICU has been in atrial
   tachycardia, has been converted to PO amiodarone
   - continue PO amiodarone
   - can back off on diuresis if tachycardia increased
   #. ARF:
   Cr stable
   - trend cr and monitor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   # Coagulapathy
   DDx include DIC, antibiotics, poor nutrition. INR mildly improved after
   vitamin K.
   - hold on FFP for now.
   - check fibrinogen
   .
   # Volume status- will plan to diuresed with lasix gtt, goal 500 to
   1000cc negative

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated, on pressors, and being treated for VAP/aspiration pneumonia. The patient's recent events include bronchial secretions with minimal hemoptysis, WBC count increasing from 15 to 17, and lactate levels worsening. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:
1. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing hypotension due to sepsis with a pulmonary source. This is supported by the trend of decreasing lactate levels.
2. Critical AS/systolic CHF: The patient has critical aortic stenosis and may also have systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) due to the condition.
3.?HIT: There is a possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), although it is currently felt to be unlikely. Further evaluation and discussion with the hematology team is recommended.
4. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing frequent episodes of atrial tachycardia, which may be triggered by hypoxia.
5. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with stable creatinine levels, and monitoring of urine output and renal dosing of"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C and not tolerating
   attempts at pressure support this morning. Likely cause is HAP vs
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Continues to have generous secretions.
   - continue on current settings A/C,  recheck ABG
    - continue broad Abx: meropenem [**6-15**],  vanc [**8-15**], Cipro [**6-15**]
    - plan for pleural tap of effusion on right today
 will send fluid
   for cytology and cultures
   #Leukocytosis:  WBC on rise over past 2-3 days and is up to 16-17
   range. Source may be PNA vs. stage III ducubitus ulcer or c.difficile.
   Although infrequent bowel movements places C.diff low on differential.
   No current fevers. Lactate up to 2 from 1 range.
   -  CIS
    - cont f/u all culture data
    - cont [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro/ vanco coverage as above
   # VAP: RML &  RLL infiltrate felt to be from likely aspiration.
   Fevers better but still elevated WBCs as above.
   - continue  vanc (d1=[**4-7**], today d8),  [**Last Name (un) **] (d1=[**4-9**], today d6), cipro
   (d1=[**4-9**], today d6)
 plan is for a full 10 day course
   - tapping and culturing R sided effusion today
   - f/u pending micro/ Cx data
   - consider checking glucan/galactomannan if no significant improvement
   though note pt recently on zosyn so may be false po
   # Hypotension
   Likely due to sepsis with pulmonary source, as above. Lactates have

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (PNA). He remains intubated on assisted/controlled ventilation and is not tolerating pressure support. The patient has a left-sided PNA and pleural effusion (mostly right side). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated and not tolerating attempts at pressure support, indicating ongoing respiratory distress. This could be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration PNA. Continuous monitoring of ABG and ongoing broad antibiotic coverage are planned.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is rising, suggesting an ongoing infection. The source of leukocytosis may be PNA or a stage III decubitus ulcer. Close follow-up of culture data and continued broad antibiotic coverage are recommended.

3. VAP: The patient has right middle lobe and right lower lobe infiltrates, which are likely due to aspiration. Fevers have improved, but the patient still has elevated WBCs. Tapping and culturing the right-sided effusion today, along with a full 10-day course of antibiotics, is planned.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is"

   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C and not tolerating
   attempts at pressure support this morning. Likely cause is HAP vs
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Continues to have generous secretions.
   - continue on current settings A/C,  recheck ABG
    - continue broad Abx: meropenem [**6-15**],  vanc [**8-15**], Cipro [**6-15**]
    - plan for pleural tap of effusion on right today
 will send fluid

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's respiratory status remains unstable as he continues to have difficulty tolerating pressure support and is still intubated on assisted controlled ventilation (A/C). The presence of secretions, left-sided pneumonia, and pleural effusion suggests ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and a pleural tap will be performed to obtain fluid for cytology and cultures.

Leukocytosis is observed, with a rising white blood cell (WBC) count over the past few days. The source of leukocytosis could be pneumonia or a stage III decubitus ulcer. Although infrequent bowel movements lower the likelihood of Clostridium difficile infection, lactate levels have increased to 2, indicating possible sepsis.

The patient has right-sided pleural effusion, which will be tapped and cultured today. The effusion is likely due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis from pneumonia and critical aortic stenosis. Goal diuresis with lasix is being implemented, and levophed is being used to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of more than 65.

Aortic valve replacement has been put on hold"

   antibiotics transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory
   distress still intubated, on pressors, being treated for VAP/aspiration
   PNA.
   # VAP: RML and RLL infiltrate, likely an aspiration pneumonia. Consider
   fungal infection, though less likely - .  Fever curve trending down but
   has new increased leukocytosis overnight. Other potential sources
   include decub, less likely C diff. Line has been pulled. No evidence of
   peripheral clots on recent ultrasounds. Oxygenation stable.

   - repeat blood and urine cx, stool C diff
   - consider checking glucan/galactomannan if no significant improvement
   though note pt recently on zosyn so may be false po
   # Hypotension
   Likely due to sepsis with pulmonary source, as above. Lactates have
   trended down. Baseline critical AS. Have started gentle diuresis with
   lasix gtt overnight. Has had good UOP

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia and underwent a 10-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was then transferred to the MICU with hypoxia and respiratory distress, still intubated, on pressors, being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. VAP/aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently being treated for VAP. There are infiltrates in the right middle lobe (RML) and right lower lobe (RLL), likely indicating an aspiration pneumonia. Fungal infection is also considered, but less likely. The fever curve is trending down, but there is new increased leukocytosis overnight. Other potential sources of infection include decubitus ulcers and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). A pleural effusion should be considered for tapping, and blood, urine, and stool cultures should be repeated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis with a pulmonary source. Lactates have trended down, indicating some improvement. Diuretics have been started to manage fluid balance, and the goal is to achieve a urine output of 100 cc/hr and negative fluid balance of 1L overnight. Lev"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C and not tolerating
   attempts at pressure support this morning. Likely cause is HAP vs
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Continues to have generous secretions.
   - continue on current settings A/C,  recheck ABG
    - continue broad Abx: meropenem [**6-15**],  vanc [**8-15**], Cipro [**6-15**]
    - plan for pleural tap of effusion on right today
 will send fluid
   for cytology and cultures
   - will add back lasix drip to take off fluid overload, will hopefully
   improve weaning
   #Leukocytosis:  WBC on rise over past 2-3 days and is up to 16-17
   range. Source may be PNA vs. stage III ducubitus ulcer or c.difficile.
   Although infrequent bowel movements places C.diff low on differential.
   No current fevers. Lactate up to 2 from 1 range.

   (d1=[**4-9**], today d6)
 plan is for a full 10 day course
   - tapping and culturing R sided effusion today
   - f/u pending micro/ Cx data
   - consider re-checking glucan/galactomannan
   # Hypotension:  Improved on pressor now. Attributed to sepsis from PNA.
   Critical AS may also be contributing.
   - continue on levophed drip
   - will still continue with I/O goal diuresis with lasix gtt overnight;
   titrate UOP to neg 50cc/hr  and end goal negative 1L for the day
   - Keep on levophed with goal diuresis 1L out/24hrs, keeping MAP>65
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65

   overall unlikely true HIT.
   -cont to trend
   -stable
   -avoiding heparin products for now
   - likely ok to use in actual cards procedure ,  continue to hold
   lepirudin
   # atrial tachycardia:  flared up again this morning, probably triggered
   by recent ?infection given leukocytosis or may be from
   more  hypoxia effects
   - switch from  PO amiodarone
 IV amiodarone
   -can back off on diuresis if tachycardia increased
   #. ARF:  Cr stable and much improved from prior 1.6, now 1.1
   - trend Cr and monitor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likley from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. INR mildly improved after vitamin K.
   - hold on FFP for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated on assisted mechanical ventilation and not tolerating attempts at pressure support. The likely cause could be hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of ABG and reassessment of ventilatory support are necessary.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is rising over the past few days, reaching 16-17 range. The source may be pneumonia, stage III decubitus ulcer, or Clostridium difficile infection. No current fevers are present, but lactate levels have increased to 2 from 1 range.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has RML and RLL infiltrates, likely due to aspiration. Fevers have improved but elevated WBCs persist. The current treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem for a full 10-day course. Tapping and culturing the right-sided effusion today is planned.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved on vasopressor support. Sepsis from"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation, awaiting aortic valve replacement. He presented with pneumonia and is now experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents, thrombocytopenia, and various medical conditions.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 93/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery through an endotracheal tube.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.0 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 1.4 mmol/L, and abnormal liver function tests. His platelet count is low at 75 K/uL, and his kidney function is within normal limits with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient has several potential medical complications. Firstly, he is experiencing respiratory failure due to HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia) versus aspiration pneumonia on the left side with a large right-sided pleural effusion. The latest chest X-ray shows partial collapse of the left middle lobe but no obvious secretions.

Secondly, the patient has leukocytosis, which could be"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure: HAPvs aspiration PNA on L with large R sided
   pleural effusion, todays cxr with collapse lml but no obvious
   secretions
    - cont vanc [**8-15**], [**Last Name (un) **] [**6-15**], Cipro [**6-15**]
    - tap R sided pleural effusion to improve TLC
   2. Leukocytosis: ? ducbitus ulcer, pulmonary process, cdif (less likley
   in absence of diarrhea)
    - cont f/u cultures
    - cont abx
   3. HoTN: critical AS with EF 20%, CVP > 12, appears overall volume
   overloaded, compounded by tachycardia
    - will restart amio gtt for hr control
    - cont lasix gtt aim gentle diuresis (-25 to -50cc/hr)
    - increase levophed as necessary
    - repeat TTE if continued hemodynamic instability
    - cont trend q 8 hr lactate, CVO2

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis (AS), moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR). He is awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR) and presented with pneumonia, leading to respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 90/53 to 93/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and a temperature of 37.7Â°C. 

The patient is currently receiving several medications including norepinephrine, propofol, pantoprazole, neutraphos, B12, ASA, allopurinol, MVI, chlorhexadine, ciprofloxacin, amiodarone, and vancomycin. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of pleural rub in the left upper lobe (LUL). 

On physical examination, the patient appears thin and anxious. His breath sounds are not clear with bronchial breath sounds heard over the left lung and diminished breath sounds over the right lung. There is also evidence of right and left lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2-17.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 37.0-35.6%, platelet count of 83-"

   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA.
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C and not tolerating
   attempts at pressure support this morning. Likely cause is HAP vs
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Continues to have generous secretions.
   - continue on current settings A/C,  recheck ABG
    - continue broad Abx: meropenem [**6-15**],  vanc [**8-15**], Cipro [**6-15**]
    - plan for pleural tap of effusion on right today
 will send fluid
   for cytology and cultures
   - will add back lasix drip to take off fluid overload, will hopefully
   improve weaning
   #Leukocytosis:  WBC on rise over past 2-3 days and is up to 16-17
   range. Source may be PNA vs. stage III ducubitus ulcer or c.difficile.
   Although infrequent bowel movements places C.diff low on differential.
   No current fevers. Lactate up to 2 from 1 range.
   -  CIS
    - cont f/u all culture data , sputum Cx from [**4-13**]
    - cont [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro/ vanco coverage as above \\
   .
   # VAP: RML &  RLL infiltrate felt to be from likely aspiration.
   Fevers better but still elevated WBCs as above.
   - continue  vanc (d1=[**4-7**], today d8),  [**Last Name (un) **] (d1=[**4-9**], today d6), cipro
   (d1=[**4-9**], today d6)
 plan is for a full 10 day course
   - tapping and culturing R sided effusion today
   - f/u pending micro/ Cx data
   - consider re-checking glucan/galactomannan
   # Hypotension:  Improved on pressor now. Attributed to sepsis from PNA.
   Critical AS may also be contributing.
   - continue on levophed drip
   - will still continue with I/O goal diuresis with lasix gtt overnight;
   titrate UOP to neg 50cc/hr  and end goal negative 1L for the day
   - Keep on levophed with goal diuresis 1L out/24hrs, keeping MAP>65
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   .
   # Hyponatremia:
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - f/up any cards surgery recs
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   - lasix gtt with goal UOP 50cc/hr, goal -1L out overnight
   - PM lytes
   # thrombocytopenias:  felt to be  possible HIT.  Heme following and
   after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that
   overall unlikely true HIT.
   -cont to trend
   -stable
   -avoiding heparin products for now
   - likely ok to use in actual cards procedure ,  continue to hold
   lepirudin
   # atrial tachycardia:  flared up again this morning, probably triggered
   by recent ?infection given leukocytosis or may be from
   more  hypoxia effects
   - switch from  PO amiodarone
 IV amiodarone
   -can back off on diuresis if tachycardia increased
   #. ARF:  Cr stable and much improved from prior 1.6, now 1.1
   - trend Cr and monitor UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likley from

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated on assisted mechanical ventilation (A/C) due to respiratory failure. The cause of respiratory failure is likely hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) versus aspiration pneumonia. The patient continues to have generous secretions, and the current settings of A/C should be rechecked along with ABG analysis.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is on the rise, indicating leukocytosis. The source of leukocytosis may be pneumonia or a stage III decubitus ulcer. Although infrequent bowel movements place Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) low on the differential, it should still be considered. The patient's lactate levels are also elevated.

3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is suspected to be caused by aspiration from a left-sided pneumonia and pleural effusion (mostly right-sided). Broad antibiotics have been continued, and a pleural tap of the effusion will be performed today to send fluid"

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has multiple medical complications, including leukocytosis, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary complications: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently being treated for VAP. There is a concern for a complicated pleural effusion or fungal process. Monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory distress, such as increased secretions, hypoxia, or changes in vital signs, is essential.

2. Cardiac complications: The patient has critical aortic stenosis and may develop systolic heart failure. Close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and signs of fluid overload are necessary. The patient's AVR procedure may be delayed due to infection and the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

3. Infectious complications: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. However, there is a concern for other infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, or fungal infection. Monitoring for fever, leukocytosis, and positive cultures is important.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient has leukocytosis, indicating a possible new infectious or inflammatory process. Other potential complications include pulmonary complicated effusion, fungal process, more resistant organism, sacral decub wound, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and central line infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic vs Cardiogenic Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis or cardiogenic causes. Cool extremities suggest the latter, indicating potential cardiac involvement.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and likely has healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration PNA. Fluid overload may also contribute to respiratory failure.
3. Critical AS/Systolic CHF: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and systolic congestive heart failure require careful management, especially considering the planned AVR.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be due to possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, further evaluation is needed.
5. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has atrial t"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. Initial lab results showed leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated troponin levels. The patient underwent an ultrasound of the abdomen and renal system, as well as blood cultures. The patient also had an EKG performed.

During the course of treatment, the patient received various medications including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, fentanyl, midazolam, phenylephrine, lasix, amio, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs were monitored closely, with fluctuations in temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's fluid balance and hemodynamic status were also closely monitored.

The patient underwent drainage of a right lung pleural effusion, which was determined to be transudative in nature. The patient's renal function and liver function were assessed, with some improvement noted. The patient's electrolyte levels were monitored, showing imbalances in potassium, sodium, and chloride.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and elevated leukocyte count suggests a possible infection leading to sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Please see resident note for full details. Briefly, 79 y/o man with
   critical AS, pneumonia, with persistent hypotension and respiratory
   failure.
   Briefly, would add/emphasize:
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 multifactorial, with contributions of dense
   necrotizing LLL pneumonia, and CHF (aortic valve disease).  Plan
   continue mechanical ventilation, monitor SaO2.  No immediate plans for
   SBT, but hope to move to SBT and exbutation trial as pneumonia
   resolves.
   HYPOTENSION
  multifactorisl; difficult situation with low LV EF,
   likely low SVR, and critical aortic stenosis.  Tachycardia on levophed
 now on neosinephrine.  Would be very cautious with diuresis given
   that oxygenation is fairly stable. Changed to Propofol to
   Versed/Fentanyl, d/c b-blocker.
   FEVER
 with leukocytosis, likely attributable to dense LLL pneumonia.
   LENI's negative this week, CXR improving, pleural effusion
   transudative.  Cultures negative, including finalized blood culture so
   yeast less likely. Change central line today.
   FLUIDS
 euvolemia, but tenuous.  Aim to keep net even today.
   HIT - testing not conclusive, off heparin. Hematology consult service
   following.
   AORTIC STENOSIS
 critical .  Requires surgical repair, but on hold
   with active extensive lung infection.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, pneumonia, and hypotension. He is currently in the ICU and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.5Â°F, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 83/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has a history of allergies to heparin agents and thrombocytopenia.

The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Meropenem), analgesics (Fentanyl and Morphine), and sedatives (Midazolam). The patient's blood products and fluid balance are being closely monitored, with a total input of 3,315 mL and output of 2,658 mL.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.7 thousand cells/microliter, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 28 mEq/L, hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 182 mg/dL, and elevated lactate acid level of 1.8 mmol/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals trace lower extremity edema and cool extremities. The neurological examination shows that the patient follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and movement assessment is not available."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has leukocytosis, suggesting a new infectious/inflammatory process. Possible diagnoses include pulmonary complicated effusion, fungal process, more resistant organism not covered by the last antibiotic, sacral decub wound, Clostridium difficile infection, and line infection. Microorganisms have only been identified in the yeast from urine and sputum, but no blood cultures have grown yeast. Less likely causes include clot, acalculous cholecystitis, sinuses, and eosinophilia due to drug reaction. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, respiratory failure, critical AS/systolic CHF, thrombocytopenia, atrial tachycardia, hyponatremia, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complicated Effusion: The patient's left-sided pneumonia and pleural effusion suggest the possibility of a complicated effusion.
2. Fungal Process: Yeast has been identified in the urine and sputum cultures, indicating a potential fungal infection.
3. More Resistant Organism: The patient may be infected with a more resistant organism not covered by the current antibiotics.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting an aortic valve replacement who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and only yeast has been found in the sputum and urine cultures.

The patient's RUQ ultrasound is equivocal for cholecystitis, but the patient appears to be improving with medical management. The patient's troponin levels are within normal range, suggesting no cardiac ischemia. However, the patient has leukocytosis, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.3Â°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/52-91/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation with a PEEP of 12 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's chest X-ray shows left-sided opacities as before, with the endotracheal tube and LiJ in good position.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who is awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. He was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Infectious/inflammatory process: The patient has leukocytosis, which is a high white blood cell count, indicating a possible new infection or inflammatory process.

2. Pulmonary complications: The patient has a left-sided pneumonia and pleural effusion. These can lead to further respiratory failure and require close monitoring and management.

3. Sacral decub wound: The patient has a sacral decub (pressure ulcer), which needs to be managed to prevent infection and promote healing.

4. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient's history of antibiotic use increases the risk for C. diff infection, which needs to be considered and monitored.

5. Line infection: The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and multi-lumen central line. These lines can become infected, leading to serious complications. Regular assessment and appropriate care are necessary.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT is"

 only yeast from sputum,
   urine.
   - continue meropenem d8,  vanc d10. will dc cipro and consider stopping

   - wound care eval of decub
 if progressing consider debridement
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - hold on HIDA scan for now, though would consider if LFTs trending up,
   leukocytosis, abdominal tenderness for example
   .
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Yesterday
   appeared intravascularly dry based on small IJ, elevated bicarb. BP
   improved improved with IVF yesterday, legs warmer c/w improved

   - Volume goal net even today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   - consider adrenal insufficiency w/u, though team preferring to hold on
   this today
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment yesterday following
   line placement, better with increased PEEP
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - holding on diuresis (see above)
   - pneumonia treatment as above

   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiac surgery

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the differential diagnosis includes septic shock versus cardiogenic shock.
- Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated on assisted mechanical ventilation due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia. There is evidence of left-sided pneumonia and pleural effusion, mostly on the right side. The patient experienced derecruitment following line placement but improved with increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
- Critical AS/systolic CHF: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and systolic congestive heart failure are being managed. The aortic valve replacement has been put on hold due to infection and concerns about heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
- Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which has been evaluated by the hematology team. The platelet count is now trending stable.
- Atrial tachycardia: The patient has an atrial tachycardia, likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and volume depletion. The patient is being treated with amiodarone.
- Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, possibly due to total body volume overload and euvolemia.
- Coagulopathy: The patient had elevated prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) but has shown improvement. The coagulopathy is likely due to medications and poor nutrition rather than disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's care plan includes:
- Continue meropenem and vancomycin antibiotics.
- Evaluate and manage sacral decubitus ulcer.
- Follow up on microbiological markers.
- Hold on HIDA scan for now.
- Continue levophed infusion and wean as tolerated.
- Administer additional fluid boluses to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) above 10.
- Monitor urine output and mean arterial pressure (MAP).
- Repeat central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) and lactate levels.
- Consider adrenal insufficiency workup.
- Wean PEEP as tolerated.
- Hold on diuretics.
- Continue pneumonia treatment.
- Control tachycardia as per above.
- Follow up on cardiac surgery recommendations.
- Use heparin if needed during cardiac procedures.
- Trend platelet count.
- Continue amiodarone.
- Limit free water administration.
- Trend daily coagulation parameters.
- Consider debridement for sacral decubitus ulcer."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including heart failure, chronic aortic stenosis, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. He is in the ICU due to severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission and requires vasopressor support with norepinephrine. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has been unstable. There have been changes made to his treatment regimen, including increasing PEEP and switching back to levophed. Fungal markers were sent off for testing. The patient's right upper quadrant ultrasound showed gallbladder wall thickening, but it was considered nonspecific and further investigation with HIDA or Percutaneous Cholecystostomy was held off pending further clinical changes. 

A family meeting is scheduled for Monday at 3 pm to discuss the patient's prognosis. The patient has an allergy to heparin agents and thrombocytopenia. He has received multiple doses of antibiotics since admission. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.2 C (99Â°F), heart rate 95 bpm (84-119), blood pressure 90/52 mmHg (66/45-91/57), respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute (7-25), oxygen saturation 98% on 50% FiO2. The patient's weight has decreased from 77.4 kg at admission to 72.7 kg currently. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 23.3 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of 0.02, and slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits or show minimal abnormalities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a history of aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory failure or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction and ongoing infection. There is a risk of progression to septic shock or multiorgan failure.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, and his current condition may exacerbate this condition, leading to worsening cardiac function.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can progress and lead to a worsening infection in the lungs.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest, which can lead to pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers.
6. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
7. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which can be exacerbated by immobility and medications.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
10. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has chronic aortic stenosis, which can lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   I agree with plan as outlined in the resident note. Briefly, ongoing
   pressor reguirement and high PEEP. Peripheral perfusion seems improved
   today based on exam, I suspect we are at a good
   point with his filling pressures. Clearly responding better to levo
   than neo and no dangerous tachycardia. Would try to wean PEEP, then
   fi02 today. Wean levo as able but suspect will not be able to make much
   progress. Afebrile now and WBC coming down. LFT's trending down as
   well. Has had 10 days of [**Last Name (un) **] and 8 days of cipro. Line change
   yesterday for ?line sepsis leading to fever and still the issue
   of the scaral dcub. For those reasons I think it is reasonable to
   continue vancomycin, but could peel off cipro/[**Last Name (un) **]. Will stop cipro
   today, [**Last Name (un) **] next if stays stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and experiencing ongoing shock and respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU and require pressor support and high PEEP. The patient's peripheral perfusion has improved, and their filling pressures seem to be at an optimal level. They are responding better to levo than neo and do not have dangerous tachycardia. The plan is to wean PEEP and FiO2 today and try to wean off levo as able. The patient's fever has resolved, and their WBC count and LFTs are trending down. They have been on multiple antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, due to suspected line sepsis and the presence of scalp debris. The decision has been made to continue vancomycin but stop ciprofloxacin if the patient remains stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's history of line sepsis and persistent presence of scalp debris may indicate an ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, as evidenced by the need for mechanical ventilation and high PEEP. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
3. Hypotension: The patient continues to require pressor support, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could be due to septic shock or other underlying causes.
4. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's lab"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 79-year-old man with critical aortic stenosis, necrotic pneumonia, persistent hypotension, and respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires PEEP to maintain oxygen saturation. The pneumonia appears to be caused by a combination of community-acquired organisms and hospital-acquired organisms, including anaerobic bacteria. The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic shock from the pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including dense necrotizing left lower lobe pneumonia and congestive heart failure (tight aortic stenosis). He will need to continue mechanical ventilation and monitor his oxygen saturation levels. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the need for PEEP, which can offset his aortic stenosis.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has already been on antibiotics for 10 days but still requires additional coverage for anaerobic bacteria, which are commonly present in necrotizing pneumonia. 

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is requiring the use of levophed, a vasopressor. He has been able to wean off neo and transition to levo. 

4. Fever: The patient has been afebrile since Friday, suggesting that his fever may have been secondary to the necrotic pneumonia.

   with medical management. No new micro data
 only yeast from sputum,
   urine.
   - continue meropenem d8,  vanc d10. will dc cipro and consider stopping
   [**Last Name (un) **] tomorrow.
   - wound care eval of decub
 if progressing consider debridement
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - hold on HIDA scan for now, though would consider if LFTs trending up,
   leukocytosis, abdominal tenderness for example
   .
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Yesterday
   appeared intravascularly dry based on small IJ, elevated bicarb. BP
   improved improved with IVF yesterday, legs warmer c/w improved
   perfusion.
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Would give additional fluid boluses as need to keep CVPs >10
   - Volume goal net even today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   - consider adrenal insufficiency w/u, though team preferring to hold on
   this today
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment yesterday following
   line placement, better with increased PEEP
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - holding on diuresis (see above)
   - pneumonia treatment as above

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.8F, blood pressure ranging from 83/51mmHg to 96/55mmHg, heart rate between 107-118 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging shows a left-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray.

Plan:

1. Continue meropenem, vancomycin, and consider stopping ciprofloxacin tomorrow.
2. Evaluate wound care for sacral decubitus ulcer and consider debridement if necessary.
3. Follow up with micro and fungal markers.
4. Hold on HIDA scan for now, but consider if liver function tests (LFTs) are trending up, leukocytosis, abdominal tenderness, etc.
5. Monitor for hypotension and maintain CVPs above 10. Give additional fluid boluses as needed.
6. Wean levophed as tolerated.
7. Continue respiratory support with A/C and aim to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of septic shock, necrotizing fasciitis, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving multiple IV medications including vasopressors, antibiotics, and sedatives. His vital signs show persistent hypotension and fever. The patient's laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, and elevated liver enzymes. Chest X-ray shows left-sided infiltrate, which is consistent with previous findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite the administration of vasopressors, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may suggest inadequate tissue perfusion and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and necrotizing fasciitis suggests an ongoing infection. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection and adjustment of antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential to prevent further deterioration.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating thrombocytopenia. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications. Monitoring platelet levels and considering platelet transfusion if necessary is important.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. 

The patient has been in the ICU since April 13th and is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. The vital signs show a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 83/51 mmHg (with previous readings ranging from 79/46 to 96/55 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's recent events include sputum culture positive for yeast, a drop in blood pressure overnight, administration of 500cc normal saline IV fluid, discontinuation of Ciprofloxacin coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), initiation of Vancomycin/Vanco coverage, and addition of Flagyl for better anaerobic coverage, possibly indicating necrotizing type pneumonia. 

The patient's WBC count has decreased from 19 to 15 today, and there has been a spike in fever to 100.8Â°F with cultures sent off. A plastic [Doctor's Name] consult is being considered for sacral decubitus. 

The patient has allergies to heparin agents and thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Ciprofloxacin on April 16th at 10:01 AM, Vancomycin on April 16th at 08:00 PM, Metronidazole on April 17th at 12:01 AM, and Meropenem on April 17th at 04:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed) at 0.5 mg/hour, fentanyl (concentrate) at 25 mcg/hour, and norepinephrine at 0.16 mcg/kg/min. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

The patient's flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, PIP of 27 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O, and compliance of 28.6 cmH2O/mL. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, PaO2 of 360 mmHg, and oxygen ventilation of 10 L/min. 

The patient's physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, neurologic examination not assessed, and other findings not provided.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA.
   #Leukocytosis
   WBC now trending down.  Have been targeting suspected L sided
   pneumonia. Another source may be his sacral decub and potential osteo.
   RUQ u/s equivocal for cholescystitis, but pt appears to be improving
   with medical management. No new micro data
 only yeast from sputum,
   urine.
   - continue meropenem d9,  vanc d11
 would continue for 15d course.
   Unclear that flagyl is adding much, doubt C diff, and meropenem has
   good anaerobic coverage
   - wound care eval of decub
 will ask plastics to eval for ?debridement
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - hold on HIDA scan for now, though would consider if LFTs trending up,
   leukocytosis, abdominal tenderness for example
   .
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range.
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Would give additional fluid boluses as need to keep CVPs >10
   - Volume goal net even today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment yesterday following
   line placement, better with increased PEEP
 have now been able to come
   down on PEEP
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - holding on diuresis (see above)
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - f/up any cards surgery recs
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   # transaminitis
   Suspect shock liver, LFTs are perfusing. GB wall thickening on US
   nonspecific.
   - continue to trend
   - liver recs appreciated
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay
   Recently stable
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiac surgery
   # atrial tachycardia:
   Likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and some degree of volume
   depletion
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likley from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. INR mildly improved after vitamin K.
   - hold on FFP for now.
   - cont trend daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
- The patient has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia.
- His condition has been improving, but he still requires mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and there are concerns about septic versus cardiogenic causes.
- He is currently on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem, vancomycin, and Flagyl, which may be contributing to his thrombocytopenia.
- The patient has a left-sided pleural effusion and pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.
- His left lower extremity (LIE) is edematous, and there is a suspicion of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient has a history of atrial tachycardia and is currently on amiodarone.
- He has signs of coagulopathy, possibly due to medication or poor nutrition.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and there is evidence of gallbladder wall thickening on ultrasound.
- There are concerns about his critical aortic stenosis and the need for AVR, which has been put on hold due to infection and potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with recent increase in leukocytosis of unknown
   etiology, which is now trending downwards.
   #Leukocytosis
   WBC now trending down.  Have been targeting suspected L sided
   pneumonia. Another source may be his sacral decub and potential osteo.
   RUQ u/s equivocal for cholescystitis, but pt appears to be improving
   with medical management. No new micro data
 only yeast from sputum,
   urine.
   - continue meropenem d10,  vanc d12
 would continue for 15d course.
   Unclear that flagyl is adding much, doubt C diff, and meropenem has
   good anaerobic coverage
   - wound care eval of decub
 will ask plastics to eval for ?debridement
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - hold on HIDA scan for now, though would consider if LFTs trending up,
   leukocytosis, abdominal tenderness for example
   .
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors. CVP 15 this AM
   - Continue levophed, has been weaned down to 0.12
   - Keep CVPs 12-14
   - Volume goal net even today, follow CVP
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment over weekend following
   line placement, better with increased PEEP
 have now been able to come
   down on PEEP
   - wean PEEP as tolerated, aim for 8 today
   - holding on diuresis (see above)
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - talk to CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] today regarding whether they will do surgery,
   criteria for this. Will want these recs prior to meeting
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - f/up any cards surgery recs
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   # transaminitis
   Suspect shock liver, LFTs are perfusing. GB wall thickening on US
   nonspecific.
   - continue to trend
   - liver recs appreciated
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay
   Recently stable
   - need heme final note in chart regarding use of heparin in surgery
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiac surgery
   # atrial tachycardia:
   Likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and some degree of volume
   depletion
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likley from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. INR mildly improved after vitamin K.
   - hold on FFP for now.
   - cont trend daily

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/aspiration pneumonia with recent increase in leukocytosis of unknown etiology, which is now trending downwards. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.8Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 83/51 mmHg to 96/55 mmHg, heart rate of 107 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus tachycardia. His weight has decreased from 77.4 kg to 72.7 kg since admission. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,669 mL and output of 1,207 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,462 mL. The patient has received a total of 2,529 mL of IV fluids and given 926 mL back. Blood products totaling 1,207 mL have been transfused, and the patient has had a urine output of 1,207 mL. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 27 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O, and fraction"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He presented with pneumonia while awaiting aortic valve replacement, and his course has been complicated by possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving sedation and analgesia. He has a central venous line, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter in place. His vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with low-grade temperatures, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). Imaging shows gallbladder wall thickening, which is likely nonspecific, and there are signs of decubitus ulcers. The patient's renal function is within normal limits.

The patient's medical history is significant for critical aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and recent pneumonia. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of low-grade temperatures.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, endotracheal tube in place, right and left radial pulses present, right and left dorsalis pedis pulses present, bilateral lower extremity edema, muscle wasting, and inability to stand. Neurologic examination shows response to noxious stimuli, non-purposeful movements, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis (AS), congestive heart failure (CHF), and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). The patient presented with pneumonia while awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) and the course of treatment has been complicated by suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/56 mmHg to 79/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 88 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 1.3 to 1.1 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransfer"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with recent increase in leukocytosis of unknown
   etiology, which is now trending downwards.
   # Leukocytosis , PNA - WBC trending slightly up today and still febrile
   overnight.  CXR slightly worse at bases.
   Could have bacteremia in setting of debridement, though suspect less
   likely. Prior RUQ u/s was nondiagnostic for cholecystitis
 and LFTs
   stable today (though bili not yet back). Could necrotic focus in L lung
   where antibiotic penetration is limited. Also, today concern for LUE
   clot which could also lead to fevers .,
   - continue meropenem d11,  vanc d13
 would continue for 15d course.
   Unclear that flagyl is adding much, doubt C diff, and meropenem has
   good anaerobic coverage
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - repeat RUQ u/s
 sludging otherwise no change
   - check LUE u/s
 negative for clot
   - will check CT chest/abd
   - will consult ID
   .
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  However, now significantly positive the last few
   days
   - Continue levophed, has been weaned down to 0.12
   - Keep CVPs 12-14 --- will start lasix back today goal -1L
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment over weekend following
   line placement, better with increased PEEP
 did not tolerate PEEP
   weaning to 8 yesterday.
   - restarting diuresis as above
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - discuss ?valvuloplasty options with interventional cards, CT surgery
   previously felt role for this was limited
   - f/up any cards surgery recs
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   # transaminitis: Suspect shock liver, LFTs are stable. GB wall
   thickening on US nonspecific.
   - continue to trend
   - repeating RUQ u/s today, as above
   - liver recs appreciated
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay
   Recently stable
   - need heme final note in chart regarding use of heparin in surgery
   -adding back SC heparin for DVT as appears safe now
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiac surgery
   # atrial tachycardia:
   Likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and some degree of volume
   depletion
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likley from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. INR mildly improved after vitamin K.
   - hold on FFP for now.
   - cont trend daily

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has leukocytosis of unknown etiology, which is now trending downwards. His chest X-ray shows worsening right-sided consolidation and left-sided infiltrate persists. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

1. Leukocytosis and pneumonia: The patient has an increased white blood cell count and is still febrile overnight. The chest X-ray slightly worsened at the bases. There could be bacteremia in the setting of debridement, though it is less likely. The patient could have a necrotic focus in the left lung where antibiotic penetration is limited. There is also a concern for left upper extremity clot, which could lead to fevers.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the differential diagnosis includes septic versus cardiogenic causes. The patient appears to be perfusing better with a higher range of central venous pressure (CVP), allowing for weaning down of pressors. However, the patient is significantly positive on the last few days.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated on assisted controlled ventilation. The likely cause of respiratory failure is hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration pneumonia. The patient"

   VAP/aspiration PNA with recent increase in leukocytosis of unknown
   etiology, which is now trending downwards.
   #Leukocytosis
   WBC now trending down.  Have been targeting suspected L sided
   pneumonia. Another source may be his sacral decub and potential osteo.
   RUQ u/s equivocal for cholescystitis, but pt appears to be improving
   with medical management. No new micro data
 only yeast from sputum,
   urine.
   - continue meropenem d10,  vanc d12
 would continue for 15d course.
   Unclear that flagyl is adding much, doubt C diff, and meropenem has
   good anaerobic coverage
   - wound care eval of decub
 will ask plastics to eval for ?debridement
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - hold on HIDA scan for now, though would consider if LFTs trending up,
   leukocytosis, abdominal tenderness for example
   .
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors. CVP 15 this AM
   - Continue levophed, has been weaned down to 0.12
   - Keep CVPs 12-14
   - Volume goal net even today, follow CVP
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment over weekend following
   line placement, better with increased PEEP
 have now been able to come
   down on PEEP
   - wean PEEP as tolerated, aim for 8 today
   - holding on diuresis (see above)
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - talk to CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] today regarding whether they will do surgery,
   criteria for this. Will want these recs prior to meeting
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (APNA), and there has been an increase in leukocytosis of unknown etiology, which is now trending downwards.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension with a possible etiology of septic shock versus cardiogenic shock. The CVP has been running in the higher range, allowing for weaning down of pressors.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated on assisted mechanical ventilation due to likely hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia. There is a left-sided pneumonia and pleural effusion, mostly on the right side. The patient experienced derecruitment over the weekend following line placement but improved with increased PEEP.

3. Critical AS/systolic CHF: The patient's AVR has been on hold due to infection and a question of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). It is important to talk to the cardiovascular team regarding whether they will proceed with surgery and discuss criteria for this. It is also recommended to follow any cardiac surgery recommendations.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of chronic systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a protective lung strategy. His vital signs show a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 128/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient has a central venous pressure of 11 mmHg, cardiac output of 4.3 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation of 54-64%. Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,069 mL and output of 955 mL. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 88 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and hyperglycemia. Imaging studies reveal worsening right-sided consolidation and persistent left-sided infiltrate. Blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function remains compromised, as evidenced by the need for mechanical ventilation and persistent infiltrates on chest X-ray.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing further complications related to severe sepsis, including organ dysfunction and potential septic shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with recent increase in leukocytosis of unknown
   etiology, which is now trending downwards.
   # Leukocytosis , PNA - WBC trending slightly up today and still febrile
   overnight.  CXR slightly worse at bases.
   Could have bacteremia in setting of debridement, though suspect less
   likely. Prior RUQ u/s was nondiagnostic for cholecystitis
 and LFTs
   stable today (though bili not yet back). Could necrotic focus in L lung
   where antibiotic penetration is limited. Also, today concern for LUE
   clot which could also lead to fevers .,
   - continue meropenem d11,  vanc d13
 would continue for 15d course.
   Unclear that flagyl is adding much, doubt C diff, and meropenem has
   good anaerobic coverage
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - repeat RUQ u/s
   - check LUE u/s
   - consider repeat CT chest  and repeat brochoscopy
   .
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  CV02 suggest more cardiogenic issue.
   - Continue levophed, has been weaned down to 0.12
   - Keep CVPs 12-14
   - Volume goal net -1L today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment over weekend following
   line placement, better with increased PEEP
 did not tolerate PEEP
   weaning to 8 yesterday.
   - restarting diuresis as above
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - discuss ?valvuloplasty options with interventional cards, CT surgery
   previously felt role for this was limited
   - f/up any cards surgery recs
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   # transaminitis: Suspect shock liver, LFTs are stable. GB wall
   thickening on US nonspecific.
   - continue to trend
   - repeating RUQ u/s today, as above
   - liver recs appreciated
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay
   Recently stable
   - need heme final note in chart regarding use of heparin in surgery
   -adding back SC heparin for DVT as appears safe now
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiac surgery
   # atrial tachycardia:
   Likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and some degree of volume
   depletion
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likley from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. INR mildly improved after vitamin K.
   - hold on FFP for now.
   - cont trend daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and there is an increase in leukocytosis of unknown etiology. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing concerns about hypotension, respiratory failure, critical AS/systolic CHF, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, atrial tachycardia, and coagulopathy.

1. Bacteremia: There is a concern for bacteremia in the setting of debridement, although it is suspected to be less likely.
2. Cholecystitis: Prior RUQ u/s was nondiagnostic for cholecystitis, but the patient has GB wall thickening on US, which is nonspecific. Further evaluation is needed.
3. Left-sided lung clot: There is concern for a left upper extremity clot, which could also lead to fevers.
4. Limited antibiotic penetration: There may be a necrotic focus in the left lung where antibiotic penetration is limited.
5. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension appears to be more cardiogenic in etiology, as suggested by the CV02.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with recent increase in leukocytosis of unknown
   etiology, which is now trending downwards.
   #Leukocytosis
   WBC now trending down.  Have been targeting suspected L sided
   pneumonia. Another source may be his sacral decub and potential osteo.
   RUQ u/s equivocal for cholescystitis, but pt appears to be improving
   with medical management. No new micro data
 only yeast from sputum,
   urine.
   - continue meropenem d10,  vanc d12
 would continue for 15d course.
   Unclear that flagyl is adding much, doubt C diff, and meropenem has
   good anaerobic coverage
   - wound care eval of decub
 will ask plastics to eval for ?debridement
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - hold on HIDA scan for now, though would consider if LFTs trending up,
   leukocytosis, abdominal tenderness for example
   .
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors. CVP 15 this AM
   - Continue levophed, has been weaned down to 0.12
   - Keep CVPs 12-14
   - Volume goal net even today, follow CVP
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment over weekend following
   line placement, better with increased PEEP
 have now been able to come
   down on PEEP
   - wean PEEP as tolerated, aim for 8 today
   - holding on diuresis (see above)
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   .
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - talk to CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] today regarding whether they will do surgery,
   criteria for this. Will want these recs prior to meeting
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - f/up any cards surgery recs
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   # transaminitis
   Suspect shock liver, LFTs are perfusing. GB wall thickening on US
   nonspecific.
   - continue to trend
   - liver recs appreciated
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay
   Recently stable
   - need heme final note in chart regarding use of heparin in surgery
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiac surgery
   # atrial tachycardia:
   Likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and some degree of volume
   depletion
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likley from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. INR mildly improved after vitamin K.
   - hold on FFP for now.
   - cont trend daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's leukocytosis is trending downwards. There is uncertainty about the source of the infection, with potential causes including left-sided pneumonia, sacral decubitus ulcer, and osteomyelitis. The patient's right-sided consolidation on chest X-ray is worsening, while the left-sided infiltrate persists. He has a history of worsening RUQ pain, but his condition appears to be improving with medical management. The patient has critical AS/systolic CHF and is awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR). There is a discussion regarding the timing of surgery due to the patient's infection and concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's thrombocytopenia is stable, and it is unclear if he has true HIT. Other medical complications include hypotension, respiratory failure, transaminitis, atrial tachycardia, and coagulopathy. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy. His blood cultures are pending, and he has positive yeast growth in his sputum and urine cultures. There is a need for wound care evaluation and debridement of the sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation and has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient also has leukocytosis of unknown etiology, which is trending downwards. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation in the body. It is important to monitor the patient's fever and continue appropriate antibiotic treatment.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has worsening right-sided consolidation and left-sided infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating a possible worsening of pneumonia. Continued treatment with antibiotics and monitoring for any signs of clinical improvement is necessary.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the cause could be sepsis or cardiogenic. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is on the higher range, which allows for weaning down on vasopressors. Monitoring urine output, maintaining a MAP above 65, and repeating central venous O2 and lactate levels are important.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated on assisted controlled ventilation (A/C) due to likely hospital-acquired pneumonia/aspiration PNA. The patient's"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and sepsis. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 bpm and hypotension with blood pressure readings ranging from 82/58 mmHg to 128/98 mmHg. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia or a new effusion, as evidenced by the need for prolonged ventilation and the decision to proceed with a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.0 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 80 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.6 mmol/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with low potassium at 3.1 mEq/L, low chloride at 98 mEq/L, and normal sodium at 137 mEq/L. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications include hypotension, respiratory failure, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. The potential medical complications that can"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated temperature. Their respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 238.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis and new fever overnight: The patient may have an infection, possibly due to a response to the debridement of a pressure ulcer, pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, or bacteremia. Further evaluation is needed, including a chest CT scan and bronchoscopy to assess secretions and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
2. Hypotension: The patient's poor forward flow in the setting of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation may contribute to their hypotension. Measures such as diuresis and optimization of cardiac output are being taken.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to pneumonia or a new effusion."

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and biliary sludge. The patient has been febrile and has shown signs of consolidation on a CT scan of the torso, along with a large right-sided effusion. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, furosemide, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.3Â°C (99.2Â°F), heart rate 103 bpm, blood pressure 82/51 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for RUQ pain. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated sodium, decreased potassium, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including constipation, leukocytosis, heart failure, pleural effusion, sepsis, tachycardia, respiratory failure, hypotension, aortic stenosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, acute pain, pneumonia, and aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and consolidation on the CT scan suggest the possibility of pneumonia. If left untreated, pneumonia can lead to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who is awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (APNA), and plans for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and valvuloplasty have been made.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated on assisted mechanical ventilation (A/C) due to respiratory failure, likely caused by HAP/aspiration PNA. The patient has a left-sided PNA and pleural effusion (mostly right side). There is evidence of derecruitment over the weekend following line placement, but improvement has been seen with increased PEEP. The plan is to continue diuresis, pneumonia treatment, wean PEEP as tolerated, and consider tracheostomy/PEG for long-term ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to septic versus cardiogenic causes. The patient appears to be perfusing better with a higher range of central venous pressure (CVP), which has allowed for weaning down on pressors. After valvuloplasty, the patient will have a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter in place. The plan is to continue levophed at 0.14 mcg/kg/min, keep CVP"

   VAP/aspiration PNA with recent increase in leukocytosis of unknown
   etiology, which is now trending downwards.
   # Leukocytosis , PNA - WBC trending slightly up today and still febrile
   overnight.  CXR slightly worse at bases.
   Could have bacteremia in setting of debridement, though suspect less
   likely. Prior RUQ u/s was nondiagnostic for cholecystitis
 and LFTs
   stable today (though bili not yet back). Could necrotic focus in L lung
   where antibiotic penetration is limited. Also, today concern for LUE
   clot which could also lead to fevers .,
   - continue meropenem d11,  vanc d13
 would continue for 15d course.
   Unclear that flagyl is adding much, doubt C diff, and meropenem has
   good anaerobic coverage
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - repeat RUQ u/s
 sludging otherwise no change
   - check LUE u/s
 negative for clot
   - will check CT chest/abd

   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  However, now significantly positive the last few
   days
   - Continue levophed, has been weaned down to 0.12
   - Keep CVPs 12-14 --- will start lasix back today goal -1L
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion (
   mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment over weekend following
   line placement, better with increased PEEP
 did not tolerate PEEP
   weaning to 8 yesterday.
   - restarting diuresis as above
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG

   AVR had been on hold given infection and question of HIT
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - discuss ?valvuloplasty options with interventional cards, CT surgery
   previously felt role for this was limited
   - f/up any cards surgery recs

   - liver recs appreciated
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay
   Recently stable
   - need heme final note in chart regarding use of heparin in surgery
   -adding back SC heparin for DVT as appears safe now

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
- The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (PNA), with a recent increase in leukocytosis of unknown etiology that is now trending downwards.
- The patient has stable left hepatic function tests, but biliary sludge was observed.
- The patient has right-sided consolidation and a large right effusion, leading to concerns about a left upper extremity (LUE) clot and potential bacteremia.
- The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, with ongoing hypotension.
- The patient is still intubated and on assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by HAP/aspiration PNA.
- The patient's critical aortic stenosis and systolic heart failure have led to a hold on aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.
- The patient is experiencing transaminitis, likely due to shock liver, and there is nonspecific GB wall thickening on ultrasound.
- The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but further evaluation is needed.
- The patient has an atrial tachycardia likely exacerbated by pressors, infection"

   # Leukocytosis , PNA
 WBC trending downwards, 12 today, no fever
   spikes overnight.  Nothing on repeat RUQ US or CT torso indicating
   locus of untreated infection. ID involved yesterday. Continues on broad

   - ID consulted yesterday: recs:
Suggest:
1)                 would do TEE with valvuloplasty: r/o vegs
2)                 repeat urine legionella
3)                 sputum for legionella
4)                 ANCA
5)                 ESR; CRP
6)                 Beta glucan and galactomannan
7)                 Continue IV vanco and meropenem for empiric broad coverage at
this point
8)                 d/c flagyl
9)                 c diff
10)               consider VAT after valvular repair
11)               Repeat BC for fever spikes
   - continue meropenem d12,  vanc d14

   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   Plan for valvuloplasty by interventional cards today
 with TEE and PA
   cath placement
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   .
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  Hope that hemodynamics will improve after
   valvuloplasty, will also have PA catheter in place after
   - Continue levophed, at 0.14 this AM
   - Keep CVPs 12-14 --- will start lasix back today goal -1L
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion
   (mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment over weekend following
   line placement, better with increased PEEP
 continues at PEEP 10
   - continue diuresis as above
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG given longterm vent
   # transaminitis: Suspect shock liver, LFTs are stable. GB wall
   thickening on US nonspecific.
   - continue to trend
   - f/u final read RUQ US but no significant change
   - liver recs appreciated
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay. Platelets trending upwards.
   Final heme note in chart.
   - continue SC heparin for ppx
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiology procedures
   # atrial tachycardia:
   Likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and some degree of volume
   depletion
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likely from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. Slightly increased to 1.9 this AM
   - hold on FFP for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who is awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia with a plan for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and valvuloplasty today. 

The patient has been febrile and has shown signs of worsening respiratory distress, with an increase in bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is on norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. 

His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.0 x 10^9/L and a left shift. He also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 80 x 10^9/L. Other lab abnormalities include elevated lactate levels and elevated liver enzymes. 

The patient's medical team is concerned about potential complications such as septic shock, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, atrial tachycardia, and coagulopathy. They are planning to perform"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/aspiration pneumonia with plans for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)/valvuloplasty today. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically VAP and aspiration pneumonia. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, and there are ongoing efforts to identify the specific causative organism (e.g., urine and sputum cultures for Legionella).
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for derecruitment and ongoing pleural effusion.
3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, and the differential diagnosis includes septic versus cardiogenic causes. The plan is to optimize hemodynamics after valvuloplasty with the placement of a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, but further evaluation did not confirm heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Monitoring of platelet counts is ongoing.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, but it is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia, and a plan for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and valvuloplasty has been made. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 82/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is intubated on assisted ventilation mode and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently being treated for VAP. There is also a concern for possible fungal or Legionella infection, so further testing is recommended.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has critical aortic stenosis and may develop systolic heart failure. A plan for valvuloplasty is in place, but there are concerns about the patient's hemodynamics, especially hypotension that could be due to septic or cardiogenic causes.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure likely caused by HAP/aspiration PNA. There is a left-sided pleural effusion, and the patient requires careful monitoring and management of their respiratory status"

Suggest:
1)                 would do TEE with valvuloplasty: r/o vegs
2)                 repeat urine legionella
3)                 sputum for legionella

   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   Plan for valvuloplasty by interventional cards today
 with TEE and PA

   - monitor CVPs and swan numbers post procedure
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   .
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  Hope that hemodynamics will improve after
   valvuloplasty, will also have PA catheter in place after
   - Continue levophed, at 0.14 this AM
   - Keep CVPs 12-14 --- will start lasix back today goal -1L
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion
   (mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment over weekend following
   line placement, better with increased PEEP
 continues at PEEP 10
   - continue diuresis as above
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG given longterm vent

   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay. Platelets trending upwards.
   Final heme note in chart.
   - continue SC heparin for ppx
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiology procedures
   # atrial tachycardia:
   Likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and some degree of volume
   depletion
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likely from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. Slightly increased to 1.9 this AM

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/aspiration pneumonia and is planned for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)/valvuloplasty today. The patient has been febrile, with a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.2Â°F), and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications, including leukocytosis, pneumonia, hypotension, respiratory failure, transaminitis, elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, atrial tachycardia, coagulopathy, and a sacral decubitus sore.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is causing respiratory distress and hypoxia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating possible septic shock or cardiogenic shock.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely caused by HAP/aspiration PNA.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who presented with pneumonia and is now experiencing cardiogenic and septic shock. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with bilateral airspace opacities on chest X-ray indicating pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure remains low, and they require vasopressor support. They also have thrombocytopenia, which is improving after restarting heparin. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, but the exact cause cannot be determined in the setting of ongoing sepsis physiology. The patient is at risk for developing complications such as respiratory failure due to pneumonia and volume overload, hoTN (hypotension of unknown origin), and decubitus ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and volume overload may lead to further respiratory failure.
2. HoTN: The patient's hypotension could be due to cardiogenic causes related to critical AS (aortic stenosis) and low EF (ejection fraction). It is important to monitor hemodynamics post-valvuloplasty.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is improving with the restart of heparin.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, possibly due to poor liver function and ongoing sepsis physiology. Monitoring DIC (disseminated intr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who presented with pneumonia and is now experiencing cardiogenic and septic shock. He is currently intubated and sedated, and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and elevated heart rate. He is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The patient has bilateral airspace opacities on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. He is awaiting a balloon valvuloplasty procedure today and will undergo a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out endocarditis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has leukocytosis and bilateral airspace opacities on chest X-ray, indicating a possible pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and low ejection fraction could contribute to cardiogenic shock, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and hypotension.
3. Septic shock: The patient's sepsis may progress to septic shock, characterized by persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation and the need for vasopressors.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet"

   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   TEE yesterday with AI in addition to AS. Also notable for PFO
   - dobutamine echo today to assess flow across PFO, may consider PFO
   closure in addition to valvuloplasty subsequently
   - swan placement
   - wean levophed as tolerated to minimize tachycardia
   .
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  Hope that hemodynamics will improve after
   valvuloplasty, will also have PA catheter in place after
   - Continue levophed, at 0.14 this AM
   - Keep CVPs 12-14
 goal net even today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (APNA). The plan for today includes a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and valvuloplasty, as well as a dobutamine stress echo to assess flow across the patient's patent foramen ovale (PFO), with potential closure of the PFO in addition to valvuloplasty.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical AS/systolic CHF: The patient has critical aortic stenosis, which is causing systolic heart failure. The planned valvuloplasty aims to improve blood flow across the aortic valve and potentially improve cardiac output.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis or cardiogenic shock. The medical team is monitoring the patient's hemodynamics closely and adjusting pressor support as needed.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated on assisted/critical care (A/C) mode due to respiratory failure, likely caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia. The medical team is managing the pneumonia with appropriate antibiotics and planning for weaning off the ventilator.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia with a plan for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and valvuloplasty today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis and pneumonia: The patient has leukocytosis and a decreasing white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been administered, and further monitoring and treatment are needed.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to sepsis or cardiogenic causes. Efforts are being made to optimize hemodynamics, including running central venous pressure (CVP) on a higher range, weaning down on pressors, and planning for valvuloplasty to improve filling time.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated on assisted controlled ventilation (A/C) due to respiratory failure likely caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia. Continued diuresis, pneumonia treatment, and gradual weaning of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) are planned.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be attributed to shock liver. Liver function tests (LFTs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, bicuspid aortic valve, and bidirectional PFO. The patient presented with acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, pneumonia due to aspiration, and acute pleural effusion. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 82/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may lead to further respiratory compromise if not adequately managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic inflammatory response due to infection. If not treated promptly and effectively, sepsis can progress to septic shock, leading to organ failure and potentially death.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, which may worsen due to the current illness and associated fluid shifts. Adequate management of heart failure is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia secondary to aspiration, which can be a life-threatening condition if not treated appropriately.
5. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an acute pleural effusion, which can"

   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  Hope that hemodynamics will improve after
   valvuloplasty, will also have PA catheter in place after
   - Continue levophed, at 0.14 this AM
   - Keep CVPs 12-14 --- will start lasix back today goal -1L
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion
   (mostly right side).  Patient with derecruitment over weekend following

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia. The plan is to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and valvuloplasty today. The patient has various medical complications including leukocytosis, hypotension, respiratory failure, transaminitis, elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, atrial tachycardia, coagulopathy, and sacral decubitus sore.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an infection or inflammatory response.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis or cardiogenic shock. It is important to monitor CVPs and swan numbers post-procedure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated on assisted mechanical ventilation. The likely cause of respiratory failure is hospital-acquired pneumonia/aspiration pneumonia. Pneumonia treatment should continue, and weaning of PEEP should be done as tolerated.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, suggesting liver dysfunction or shock liver. Further evaluation of liver function and guidance from hepatology is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (APN), and is planned for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and valvuloplasty today. The patient has thrombocytopenia, no known drug allergies, and is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, diuretics, and vasopressors. His vital signs show low blood pressure, increased heart rate, decreased oxygen saturation, and slightly elevated body temperature. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals low central venous pressure (CVP), decreased cardiac output (CO), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) within normal range. Fluid balance shows positive net fluid intake, with higher total input exceeding total output. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode, using a low tidal volume (Vt) and assisted spontaneous breathing. Oxygenation parameters indicate good oxygen delivery but slightly reduced respiratory system compliance. Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's sedation and inability to assess certain vital signs. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly reduced hemoglobin, normal electrolyte levels, and various other lab values within normal range or slightly abnormal. Radiology images are not provided in the given information."

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Aortic stenosis and possible aortic regurgitation:
    - f/u dobutamine stress test, may be candidate for PFO closure vs
   valvuloplasty
    - appreciate interventional cardiology input
   2. HAP:
    - day 15/15 vanc, day 13/15 [**Last Name (un) **]
    - will continue meropenem for now, check vancoymcin level, woudl
   consider d/c vancomycin given prolonged course but concern for occult
   infection
   3. HoTN: likely cardiogenic, complicated by AS, MR, AR as well as
   sedating medications, increased pressor requirement this am in setting
   of increasing his fentanyl
    - will continue to proceed with gentle diuresis and aim tbb - 500 cc
   today with lasix gtt
   4. Respiratory failure: likely [**2-7**] pna, volume overload and possible
   shunt physiology
    - cont diuresis which may help both volume overload and shunt
    - cont abx as above
   5. Atrial tachycardia: pts hemodynamics are best when HR < 100, however
   he remains with pressor dependent
   6. HIT: no evidence of this and receiving subq heparin
   7. Elevated INR: cont vit K x 3days

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of a bicuspid aortic valve, who is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is also being treated for respiratory failure, likely resulting from a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of atrial tachycardia, which is not currently present. There are concerns about the patient's hypotension, which is likely cardiogenic in origin, complicated by aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), and aortic regurgitation (AR). The patient is receiving sedating medications, which may contribute to the hypotension. There are also concerns about potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and sacral decubitus. The patient's vital signs and lab results are provided, showing abnormal values in several parameters, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, total CO2, glucose, and others. The patient's condition is described as critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic stenosis and possible aortic regurgitation: The patient has a bicuspid aortic valve, which increases the risk of developing aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation. Further evaluation with a"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Aortic stenosis and possible aortic regurgitation:
    - f/u dobutamine stress test, may be candidate for PFO closure vs
   valvuloplasty
    - appreciate interventional cardiology input
   2. HAP:
    - day 15/15 vanc, day 13/15 [**Last Name (un) **]
    - will continue meropenem for now, check vancoymcin level, woudl
   consider d/c vancomycin given prolonged course but concern for occult
   infection
   3. HoTN: likely cardiogenic, complicated by AS, MR, AR as well as
   sedating medications, increased pressor requirement this am in setting
   of increasing his fentanyl
    - will continue to proceed with gentle diuresis and aim tbb - 500 cc
   today with lasix gtt
   4. Respiratory failure: likely [**2-7**] pna, volume overload and possible
   shunt physiology
    - cont diuresis which may help both volume overload and shunt
    - cont abx as above
   5. Atrial tachycardia: pts hemodynamics are best when HR < 100, however
   he remains with pressor dependent
   6. HIT: no evidence of this and receiving subq heparin
   7. Elevated INR: cont vit K x 3days

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of a bicuspid aortic valve and possible aortic regurgitation. He was admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), septic shock, and has developed atrial tachycardia. He also has evidence of volume overload, hoarseness of voice (possibly due to vocal cord edema), and a sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient's condition is complicated by his underlying aortic stenosis and regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic stenosis and possible aortic regurgitation: The patient's cardiac condition may lead to complications such as syncope, heart failure, arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac arrest.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient is at risk of developing further infections or complications related to his respiratory system.
3. HoTN (hypotension): The patient's low blood pressure could lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential multiorgan dysfunction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's reliance on mechanical ventilation indicates a severe impairment of his respiratory function, which may result in prolonged ventilatory support or the development of ventilator-associated complications.
5. Sacral decubitus ulcer: This pressure injury can worsen and potentially lead to cellulitis, infection, or other complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with plan for dobutamine stress test in setting of
   PFO found on TEE yesterday.
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   bidirectional PFO on TEE--pulm HTN, EF 20% range, bicuspid valve
   --discussion w/cards and want to get dobutamine stress echo study and
   if stenosis gradient worse- may benefit from valvuloplasty  with +/-
   PFO correction as he may be having poor CO from shunt/PFO
   - f/u dobutamine stress test today
   - f/u interventional cards recs post stress test, ask regarding any
   benefit to adding beta blocker
   --will keep NPO after MN in case procedure tomorrow .
    - monitor CVPs and swan numbers post procedure
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   # Leukocytosis , PNA
 WBC trending downwards, no fever spikes on
   current abx regimen. ID involved. No vegetations on TEE yesterday
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomanna, ANCA, CRP, cultures
- consider VAT after valvular repair
   - continue meropenem d13,  vanc d15
 Plan for additional 2 days of
   antibiotics (2 days post procedure per ID recs)
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  Hope that hemodynamics will improve after
   valvuloplasty, will also have PA catheter in place after
   - Continue levophed, at 0.16 this AM
   - Keep CVPs 12-14 --- will start lasix back today goal -500ml, keep
   negative for now
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion
   (mostly right side).  Were able to weaned down for PEEP to 5
   - continue diuresis as above
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG given longterm vent
   # transaminitis: Suspect shock liver, LFTs are stable. GB wall
   thickening on US nonspecific.
   - continue to trend
   - f/u final read RUQ US but no significant change
   - liver recs appreciated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient has a bidirectional patent foramen ovale (PFO) on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), pulmonary hypertension, an ejection fraction of 20%, and a bicuspid aortic valve. The patient may benefit from a dobutamine stress test and possibly valvuloplasty with PFO correction. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a left-sided PNA and pleural effusion. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia. He has been started on antibiotics, and his WBC count is trending downwards. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, respiratory failure, transaminitis, elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, atrial tachycardia, coagulopathy, and a sacral decubitus sore. The plan is to continue antibiotics for an additional 2 days, perform a dobutamine stress test, and consider a valvular repair with VATS after the procedure."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with plan for dobutamine stress test in setting of
   PFO found on TEE. Plan for valvuloplasty today.
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   bidirectional PFO on TEE--pulm HTN, EF 20% range, bicuspid valve
plan
   for valvuloplasty at 3-4pm today by interventional cardiology
   - f/u dobutamine stress test today
   - consider beta blocker to control tachycardia after procedure, if can
   wean
   --will keep NPO after MN in case procedure tomorrow .
    - monitor CVPs and swan numbers post procedure
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   # Leukocytosis , PNA
 WBC trending downwards, no fever spikes on
   current abx regimen. ID involved. No vegetations on TEE yesterday.
   Other possible etiology is Amiodarone induced organizing PNA -
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomanna, ANCA, CRP, cultures
- consider VAT after valvular repair
   - continue meropenem d14,  vanc d16
 Plan for additional 1 day of
   antibiotics (2 days post procedure per ID recs)
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - can consider stopping Amiodarone after procedure if not needed
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  Hope that hemodynamics will improve after
   valvuloplasty, will also have PA catheter in place after.
   - Continue levophed, at 0.16 this AM
   - Run patient even today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion
   (mostly right side).  Has been stable on PEEP to 5
   - continue diuresis as above
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG given longterm vent
   # transaminitis: Suspect shock liver, LFTs are stable. GB wall
   thickening on US nonspecific.
   - continue to trend
   - f/u final read RUQ US but no significant change
   - liver recs appreciated

   #elevated INR: Still 1.9
   - additional dose vit K today
   - trend coags
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay. Platelets trending upwards.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (APNA), and a plan for valvuloplasty is scheduled today.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has critical aortic stenosis and systolic heart failure, which increases the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart attack, or worsening heart failure.

2. Respiratory complications: The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by HAP/aspiration PNA. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or development of other lung infections.

3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has been hypotensive, and the differential diagnosis includes septic versus cardiogenic causes. After the valvuloplasty procedure, there may be hemodynamic changes that require close monitoring and management.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, but it is improving. There is a risk of bleeding complications if the platelet count drops further.

5. Coagulation abnormalities: The patient has elevated INR, but it is being managed with vitamin K supplementation. There is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, aortic stenosis, and impaired skin integrity. On admission, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits, but he was tachycardic with a heart rate of 114 bpm. The patient's blood pressure was 87/55 mmHg, respiratory rate was 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 96%. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute. The patient received antibiotics (metronidazole, vancomycin, and meropenem) for suspected sepsis with organ dysfunction.

The patient's laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 117 mg/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, elevated lactate level, and low albumin level. The patient's platelet count was also low at 86 K/uL. Imaging studies showed an acute pleural effusion.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several medical complications including constipation, leukocytosis, chronic heart failure, acute pleural effusion, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, tachycardia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension, aortic stenosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, acute pain, and possible aspiration pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications. These include:
1. Organ dysfunction: The patient's low blood pressure, elevated lactate level, and abnormal laboratory results indicate possible organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) if not managed appropriately.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and low platelet count suggest an ongoing infection. Additionally, the patient received antibiotics for suspected sepsis.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating potential dehydration or ongoing fluid losses.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's sodium level is low, indicating possible electrolyte imbalances.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's history of impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers or infections.
7. Aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis can lead to symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath.
8. Constipation: The patient's constipation can increase the risk of impaction and further complications.
9. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of aspiration leading to pneumonia.

These potential medical complications should be closely monitored and managed to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with plan for dobutamine stress test in setting of
   PFO found on TEE yesterday.
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   bidirectional PFO on TEE--pulm HTN, EF 20% range, bicuspid valve
   --discussion w/cards and want to get dobutamine stress echo study and
   if stenosis gradient worse- may benefit from valvuloplasty  with +/-
   PFO correction as he may be having poor CO from shunt/PFO
   - f/u dobutamine stress test today
   - f/u interventional cards recs post stress test, ask regarding any
   benefit to adding beta blocker
   --will keep NPO after MN in case procedure tomorrow .
    - monitor CVPs and swan numbers post procedure
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   # Leukocytosis , PNA
 WBC trending downwards, no fever spikes on
   current abx regimen. ID involved. No vegetations on TEE yesterday
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomanna, ANCA, CRP, cultures
- consider VAT after valvular repair
   - continue meropenem d13,  vanc d15
 Plan for additional 2 days of
   antibiotics (2 days post procedure per ID recs)
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  Hope that hemodynamics will improve after
   valvuloplasty, will also have PA catheter in place after
   - Continue levophed, at 0.16 this AM
   - Keep CVPs 12-14 --- will start lasix back today goal -500ml, keep
   negative for now
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion
   (mostly right side).  Were able to weaned down for PEEP to 5
   - continue diuresis as above
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG given longterm vent
   # transaminitis: Suspect shock liver, LFTs are stable. GB wall
   thickening on US nonspecific.
   - continue to trend
   - f/u final read RUQ US but no significant change
   - liver recs appreciated
   .
   #elevated INR: Still 1.9
   - additional dose vit K today
   - trend coags
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay. Platelets trending upwards.
   Final heme note in chart.
   - continue SC heparin for ppx
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiology procedures
   # atrial tachycardia:
   Likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and some degree of volume
   depletion
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likely from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. Slightly increased to 1.9 this AM
   - hold on FFP for now.
   - cont trend daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and recurrent hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions, including an arterial line placement, multi-lumen line placement, and dobutamine stress test. He is currently on multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, heparin, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/54 to 96/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, decreased muscle tone, and attention with non-purposeful movement. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, decreased platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is complicated by left ventricular dysfunction, respiratory failure, and possible septic shock. The plan includes completing a 15-day course of antibiotics, performing valvuloplasty this afternoon with a pulmonary artery line, holding off on percutaneous fossa ovalis repair, and considering tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on Monday after the procedure. The patient's code status is full code, and his current ICU disposition is unchanged. The patient is critically ill.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and recurrent hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and renal insufficiency. He is scheduled for a valvuloplasty procedure this afternoon, after which a pulmonary artery (PA) line will be placed for hemodynamic monitoring. The plan is to wean off amiodarone and decrease sedation if the patient responds well to the valvuloplasty. Tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) are planned for next Monday after the procedure, with the family aware of the plans.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AS (Aortic Stenosis): The patient's critical AS poses a risk for complications during and after the valvuloplasty procedure. Possible complications include perioperative bleeding, infection, cardiac arrhythmias, and adverse reactions to anesthesia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia increases the risk of respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and sepsis. These can lead to worsening hypoxia, increased oxygen requirements, and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. HAP: The recurrent HAP indicates an ongoing infection, which may require adjustment of antibiotic therapy and increases the risk of antibiotic resistance. It also increases"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with plan for dobutamine stress test in setting of
   PFO found on TEE. Plan for valvuloplasty today.
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   Now s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on valve area. CO appears
   adequate currently
 warm, appears to be perfusing
   - check PCWP
   - f/u cards recs
   - limit tachycardia to extent possible
   # Hypotension: Warm, lower SVR more c/w distributive picture today
   sepsis. Increased sputum production, slightly increased pressor
   requirement, but no leukocytosis or fevers. Concern for possible
   worsening pna, though uncertain
   Less c/w cardiogenic etiology currently.
   - check sputum, blood, urine cx. Had [**Female First Name (un) **] previously, negative.
   - continuing on [**Last Name (un) **] and vanco today, adding back flagyl and cipro
   today
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - I/o goal even today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. L sided consolidation
   ?pna versus organizing process, unclear. Amio stopped due to concern
   for underlying pulmonary fibrosis
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - keep PEEP at current level
   - needs repeat ABG
   - will rediscuss amiodarone tx with team
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG given longterm vent
   .
   #elevated INR:
   Elevated today in setting of heparin in cath lab. Trend coags daily.
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay. Platelets trending upwards.
   Final heme note in chart.
   - continue SC heparin for ppx
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiology procedures
   # atrial tachycardia:
   HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   levophed and volume related
   - discussing restarting amio as above
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore
   - f/up local wound care recs

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He underwent a valvuloplasty and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 87/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient has multiple medical complications. He has a history of pulmonary fibrosis and is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia. His lung function is compromised, as evidenced by worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and impaired gas exchange. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's renal function is also impaired, with an elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). His liver function tests are within normal limits, but he has elevated levels of lactate and lactic acid.

The patient's coagulation profile shows an elevated prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR), indicating a prolonged clotting time. He has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 109,000/mm3, which is likely due to sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction.

Other potential medical complications include atrial tachycardia, hypot"

   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with plan for dobutamine stress test in setting of
   PFO found on TEE. Plan for valvuloplasty today.
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   bidirectional PFO on TEE--pulm HTN, EF 20% range, bicuspid valve
plan
   for valvuloplasty at 3-4pm today by interventional cardiology
   - f/u dobutamine stress test today
   - consider beta blocker to control tachycardia after procedure, if can
   wean
   --will keep NPO after MN in case procedure tomorrow .
    - monitor CVPs and swan numbers post procedure
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   # Leukocytosis , PNA
 WBC trending downwards, no fever spikes on
   current abx regimen. ID involved. No vegetations on TEE yesterday.
   Other possible etiology is Amiodarone induced organizing PNA -
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomanna, ANCA, CRP, cultures
- consider VAT after valvular repair
   - continue meropenem d14,  vanc d16
 Plan for additional 1 day of
   antibiotics (2 days post procedure per ID recs)
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - can consider stopping Amiodarone after procedure if not needed
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  Hope that hemodynamics will improve after
   valvuloplasty, will also have PA catheter in place after.
   - Continue levophed, at 0.16 this AM
   - Run patient even today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion
   (mostly right side).  Has been stable on PEEP to 5
   - continue diuresis as above
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG given longterm vent
   # transaminitis: Suspect shock liver, LFTs are stable. GB wall
   thickening on US nonspecific.

   Final heme note in chart.
   - continue SC heparin for ppx
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiology procedures
   # atrial tachycardia:
   Likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and some degree of volume
   depletion
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likely from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. Slightly increased to 1.9 this AM
   - give 10mg vitamin K today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia (AP). A plan for valvuloplasty was made today, and the patient underwent the procedure. 

The patient has a history of pulmonary fibrosis and stopped taking amiodarone due to this concern. The patient also has a bicuspid valve and has been experiencing symptoms of heart failure. The patient's ejection fraction is 20%, indicating severe left ventricular dysfunction. 

During the procedure, there were some complications such as hypotension and leukocytosis. The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but the white blood cell count is trending downwards. There is no fever spike, and the patient's current antibiotic regimen is being continued. 

The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and he is still intubated on assisted/controlled ventilation. The likely cause of respiratory failure is hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia. 

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, possibly due to shock liver or non-specific findings. The patient's INR is elevated at 1.9, but it is being monitored and additional doses of vitamin K are being given. 

Thrombocytopenia has been present, but the serotonin release"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He underwent a valvuloplasty and is currently being treated for VAP/aspiration PNA. The patient has a history of pulmonary fibrosis and is on amiodarone, which may contribute to lung issues. His vital signs are stable, but he remains intubated on assisted ventilation. The patient has leukocytosis and evidence of pneumonia, and there are no vegetations on TEE. There is a plan for additional antibiotics, consideration of VAT after valvular repair, and stopping amiodarone after the procedure if not needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient still requires assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely caused by HAP/aspiration PNA. The plan is to continue diuresis, pneumonia treatment, and wean PEEP as tolerated.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to septic or cardiogenic causes. After the valvuloplasty, there is hope that hemodynamics will improve. The patient will continue on levophed and be monitored closely.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, the serotonin lab f/up was negative, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with plan for dobutamine stress test in setting of
   PFO found on TEE. Plan for valvuloplasty today.
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   bidirectional PFO on TEE--pulm HTN, EF 20% range, bicuspid valve
plan
   for valvuloplasty at 3-4pm today by interventional cardiology
   - f/u dobutamine stress test today
   - consider beta blocker to control tachycardia after procedure, if can
   wean
   --will keep NPO after MN in case procedure tomorrow .
    - monitor CVPs and swan numbers post procedure
   - per  heme, ok to use heparin if needed to in cards procedure as [**Male First Name (un) **]
   feel true HIT
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   # Leukocytosis , PNA
 WBC trending downwards, no fever spikes on
   current abx regimen. ID involved. No vegetations on TEE yesterday.
   Other possible etiology is Amiodarone induced organizing PNA -
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - f/u beta glucan, galactomanna, ANCA, CRP, cultures
- consider VAT after valvular repair
   - continue meropenem d14,  vanc d16
 Plan for additional 1 day of
   antibiotics (2 days post procedure per ID recs)
   - CIS, f/u micro and fungal markers
   - can consider stopping Amiodarone after procedure if not needed
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  Hope that hemodynamics will improve after
   valvuloplasty, will also have PA catheter in place after.
   - Continue levophed, at 0.16 this AM
   - Run patient even today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion
   (mostly right side).  Has been stable on PEEP to 5
   - continue diuresis as above
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG given longterm vent
   # transaminitis: Suspect shock liver, LFTs are stable. GB wall
   thickening on US nonspecific.
   - continue to trend
   - f/u final read RUQ US but no significant change
   - liver recs appreciated

   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay. Platelets trending upwards.
   Final heme note in chart.
   - continue SC heparin for ppx
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiology procedures
   # atrial tachycardia:
   Likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and some degree of volume
   depletion
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likely from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. Slightly increased to 1.9 this AM

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He underwent valvuloplasty and is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated on assisted ventilation due to likely HAP/aspiration PNA. There is a need for continued diuresis, pneumonia treatment, and weaning of PEEP as tolerated.
2. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, and the differential diagnosis includes septic vs cardiogenic causes. After valvuloplasty, there is hope for improved hemodynamics.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, but further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause. It is important to monitor platelet counts and consider SC heparin prophylaxis.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated INR, but it has improved recently. There is a need for continued monitoring and consideration of vitamin K administration.
5. Sacral decubitus sore: The patient has developed a pressure sore, which requires local wound care and enzymatic debridement.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with the healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and management plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with plan for dobutamine stress test in setting of
   PFO found on TEE. Plan for valvuloplasty today.
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   Now s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on valve area. CO not much
   improved however.
   -
   - check PCWP
   - control tachycardia as per above to improve filling time
   # Leukocytosis , PNA
 WBC trending downwards, no fever spikes on
   current abx regimen. ID involved. No vegetations on TEE yesterday.
   Other possible etiology is Amiodarone induced organizing PNA -
   - continue meropenem d15,  vanc d17
 last day today
   - CIS, f/u remaining cultures
- consider VAT after valvular repair
   # Hypotension: DDX septic vs cardiogenic in etiology.  Appears to be
   perfusing better running CVP on higher range, which has allowed weaning
   down on pressors.  Hope that hemodynamics will improve after
   valvuloplasty, will also have PA catheter in place after.
   - Continue levophed, at 0.16 this AM
   - Run patient even today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. Likely cause is HAP/
   aspiration PNA. Patient has a left sided PNA and pleural effusion
   (mostly right side).  Has been stable on PEEP to 5
   - continue diuresis as above
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean PEEP as tolerated
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG given longterm vent
   # transaminitis: Suspect shock liver, LFTs are stable. GB wall
   thickening on US nonspecific.
   - continue to trend
   - f/u final read RUQ US but no significant change
   - liver recs appreciated
   .
   #elevated INR: Still 1.9
   - additional dose vit K today
   - trend coags
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay. Platelets trending upwards.
   Final heme note in chart.
   - continue SC heparin for ppx
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiology procedures
   # atrial tachycardia:
   Likely exacerbated by pressors, infection, and some degree of volume
   depletion
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   # Coagulapathy: PT , PTT and INR all better now so DIC picture less
   likely.  Likely from
   Medications vs.  poor nutrition. Slightly increased to 1.9 this AM
   - give 10mg vitamin K today
   - cont trend daily
   .
   #sacral decubitus sore
   - f/up local wound care recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He underwent valvuloplasty and is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of pulmonary fibrosis and has been on amiodarone, which may contribute to lung changes. There are concerns about potential complications such as septic shock, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, transaminitis, elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, atrial tachycardia, coagulopathy, and sacral decubitus sore.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis suggest a possible septic response. Close monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and central venous oxygen saturation is necessary.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: With the patient's critical aortic stenosis and recent valvuloplasty, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock. Hemodynamic monitoring, including the use of a pulmonary artery catheter, is essential to assess cardiac function.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure, likely caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. Weaning off mechanical ventilation and planning for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) should be considered.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction. Monitoring liver function tests and assessing potential causes, such as shock liver or drug-induced liver injury, is crucial.
5. Elevated INR: The patient's prolonged INR indicates a bleeding risk. Vitamin K administration and close monitoring of coagulation parameters are necessary.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. Monitoring platelet levels and considering the use of platelet transfusion if necessary is important.
7. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient's atrial tachycardia may be exacerbated by infection, volume depletion, and medication effects. Close monitoring and adjustment of the medication regimen, particularly amiodarone, are recommended.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation parameters have improved, suggesting a decreased likelihood of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). However, continued monitoring of coagulation status is necessary.
9. Sacral Decubitus Sore: The patient has a sacral decubitus sore, which requires local wound care and enzymatic debridement."

   79 yo M critical AS, admitted to ICU with pneumonia, course complicated
   by recurrent HAP
    1.) Shock:  Likely combination of cardiogenic and distributive (likely
   from sepsis).  Warm extremities  and adequate CO suggests that
   distributive process dominates.
   -Will hold off on inotrope trial given CO and warm periphery
   -Will still try to target some diureses with lasix gtt but will try to
   keep CVP at 12.
   -Will broaden abx coverage by adding cipro vanc given increasing
   pressors this AM and increased sputum
   -Pan culture
   -Send LFT's, amylase/lipase.
   -Repeat PCWP today.  Send mVO2
   2.)  AS:
   -Valve area increased post valvuloplasty, however, hemodynamics not
   significantly improved thus far.
   3.) Repiratory Failure: Secondary to pneumonia and large effusion.
   -Will continue with A/C for now until ? new PNA is resolved.
   4.) Atrial tachycardia:  Currently off all rate control agents.
   Amiodarone if needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and a course complicated by recurrent hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently in shock, likely due to a combination of cardiogenic and distributive causes, with the latter being more prominent. The patient's warm extremities and adequate cardiac output suggest that the distributive process is dominant. The patient is being managed with aggressive diuresis, broadened antibiotic coverage, and monitoring for sepsis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock, possibly due to sepsis. The plan is to hold off on inotropic support, target some diuresis with Lasix, keep CVP at 12, broaden antibiotic coverage, and perform cultures.
2. Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient underwent valvuloplasty, but hemodynamics have not significantly improved. Further evaluation and management are needed.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has secondary respiratory failure due to pneumonia and a large effusion. The plan is to continue assisted ventilation until the new pneumonia is resolved.
4. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient is currently off rate control agents, and amiodarone will be used if needed. The rest of the plan is per resident note.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient is receiving a pulmonary diet.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M critical AS, admitted to ICU with pneumonia, course complicated
   by recurrent HAP
    1.) Shock:  Likely combination of cardiogenic and distributive (likely
   from sepsis).  Warm extremities  and adequate CO suggests that
   distributive process dominates.
   -Will hold off on inotrope trial given CO and warm periphery
   -Will still try to target some diureses with lasix gtt but will try to
   keep CVP at 12.
   -Will broaden abx coverage by adding cipro vanc given increasing
   pressors this AM and increased sputum
   -Pan culture
   -Send LFT's, amylase/lipase.
   -Repeat PCWP today.  Send mVO2
   2.)  AS:
   -Valve area increased post valvuloplasty, however, hemodynamics not
   significantly improved thus far.
   3.) Repiratory Failure: Secondary to pneumonia and large effusion.
   -Will continue with A/C for now until ? new PNA is resolved.
   4.) Atrial tachycardia:  Currently off all rate control agents.
   Amiodarone if needed.
   Rest of plan per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia. The patient's condition has been complicated by recurrent hospital-acquired pneumonia. 

The patient is currently experiencing shock, likely due to a combination of cardiogenic and distributive causes, with the latter possibly being from sepsis. The warm extremities and adequate cardiac output suggest that the distributive process is dominant. The plan is to hold off on inotropic support, target diuresis with Lasix, maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12, broaden antibiotic coverage by adding ciprofloxacin and vancomycin, obtain sputum cultures, repeat pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), send mixed venous oxygen (mVO2), and continue airway and respiratory support.

The patient also has aortic stenosis, for which a valvuloplasty was performed. However, there has not been significant improvement in hemodynamics post-procedure. The plan is to continue with noninvasive ventilation for now until the new pneumonia resolves.

Additionally, the patient has an atrial tachycardia, which is currently not being controlled by rate-controlling agents. Amiodarone may be used if needed.

The patient's ICU care includes nutritional support with a pulmonary formula, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, arterial and multi-lumen lines, a pulmonary artery catheter"

   Assessment and Plan:
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis awaiting AVR who was admitted
   with pneumonia, hypoxia and respiratory distress. Being treated for
   VAP/aspiration PNA with plan for dobutamine stress test in setting of
   PFO found on TEE. Plan for valvuloplasty today.
   # Critical AS/systolic CHF:
   Now s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on valve area. CO appears
   adequate currently
 warm, appears to be perfusing
   - check PCWP
   - f/u cards recs
   - limit tachycardia to extent possible
   # Hypotension: Warm, lower SVR more c/w distributive picture today
   sepsis. Increased sputum production, slightly increased pressor
   requirement, but no leukocytosis or fevers. Concern for possible
   worsening pna, though uncertain
   Less c/w cardiogenic etiology currently.
   - check sputum, blood, urine cx. Had [**Female First Name (un) **] previously, negative.
   - continuing on [**Last Name (un) **] and vanco today, adding back flagyl and cipro
   today
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - I/o goal even today
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. L sided consolidation
   ?pna versus organizing process, unclear. Amio stopped due to concern
   for underlying pulmonary fibrosis
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - keep PEEP at current level
   - needs repeat ABG
   - will rediscuss amiodarone tx with team
   - family agrees to tracheostomy / PEG given longterm vent
   .
   #elevated INR:
   Elevated today in setting of heparin in cath lab. Trend coags daily.
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay. Platelets trending upwards.
   Final heme note in chart.
   - continue SC heparin for ppx
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiology procedures
   # atrial tachycardia:
   HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   levophed and volume related
   - discussing restarting amio as above
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient underwent a valvuloplasty and is currently in the ICU for further management.

24-hour events include sending off pan cultures, adjusting vancomycin dose due to elevated trough levels, trending pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), holding PM dose of antibiotics, and conducting a family meeting.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.1 C (97%), heart rate 97 bpm, blood pressure 87/52 mmHg, respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 97%, and sinus rhythm.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.8 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 54 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include critical aortic stenosis, hypotension, respiratory failure, elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, and atrial tachycardia. The patient is currently on multiple medications including midazolam, norepinephrine, fentanyl, furosemide, pantoprazole, and heparin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia and has recently undergone valvuloplasty. The patient's blood cultures were sent off, and his vancomycin dose was adjusted due to elevated trough levels. Trending PCWP showed improvement from 25 to 20 mmHg. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 87/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 72.7 kg, and his height is 69 inches. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of (60/31) mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 20 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 5.43 L/min, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of 766 dynes*sec/cm5, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 358 dynes*sec/cm5, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 57%, stroke volume (SV) of 55 mL, stroke volume index (SVI) of 28 mL/m2, and total fluid input/output balance of 2642/2061 mL. 

The patient is receiving midazolam, norepinephrine, fentanyl, and furosemide infusions. He is also on pantoprazole and heparin sodium prophylaxis. 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.8-10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 31.1-30.9%, platelet count (Plt) of 128-84 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 32-34 mmHg, glucose of 122-205 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's assessment includes shock, sepsis, coagulopathy, leukocytosis, heart failure (CHF), chronic systolic, pleural effusion, acute, tachycardia, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hypotension (not in shock), aortic stenosis, electrolyte & fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, acute pain, pneumonia, aspiration, and others.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. On admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure. Since then, the patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, vasopressors, and other supportive medications.

The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure (87/52 mmHg), elevated heart rate (97 bpm), and normal body temperature (36.1 C). The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 97% with supplemental oxygen. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range (14 mmHg), but there are signs of fluid overload with a positive fluid balance of 922 mL since 32 AM. The patient's pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) is elevated, indicating pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.5 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels (ranging from 120 to 205 mg/dL), and elevated lactate levels (1.2 mmol/L). The patient's renal function is impaired with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The liver enzymes are within normal limits, and the electroly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who was admitted with pneumonia, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. He is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and aspiration pneumonia. The patient recently underwent valvuloplasty and is showing good effects on valve area with adequate cardiac output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has ongoing low blood pressures despite being on norepinephrine. There is concern for possible worsening pneumonia or sepsis. It is important to monitor the patient's sputum, blood, and urine cultures, and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is consolidation on the left side of the lung, which could indicate pneumonia or an organizing process. The patient's ABG results should be repeated, and pneumonia treatment should continue as previously described.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, but it is unlikely to be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Platelet counts are trending upwards, and heparin can be safely used in cardiology procedures.
4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, which is likely due to heparin therapy during the valvuloplasty. Coagulation trends should be monitored daily.

   Assessment and Plan:
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area. CO appears adequate currently  in the 5 range
 warm,
   appears to be perfusing peripherally.
   - check PCWPs q 8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 18 )
   - f/up any interventional cardiology recommendations
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O near negative~ 500cc to -1L
   , mainly keep CVP 10-12
   # Hypotension: Warm, lower SVR more c/w distributive picture such as
   infection / sepsis. Increased sputum production, slightly increased
   pressor requirement, but no leukocytosis or fevers. Concern for
   possible worsening PNA, though uncertain. Will continue on very broad
   coverage with [**Last Name (un) **]/ vanco & cipro / flagyl until cultures return and
   can decrease coverage.
   Less c/w cardiogenic etiology currently but central venous O2 sat in 57
   range does still suggest element of cardiogenic depression.
   - f/up sputum, blood, urine cx.
   - continuing on meropenem, vanco, and will peel back flagyl and cipro
   if cultures unrevealing
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - I/O  goal slightly negative (~500 to negative 1L) today  / but main
   goal is to keep CVP goal ~10
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Still intubated on A/C. L sided consolidation
   concerning for worse PNA versus organizing process, unclear. Amiodarone
    stopped due to concern for underlying pulmonary fibrosis
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean  PEEP as tolerates
   - needs repeat ABG this afternoon
   - will rediscuss amiodarone tx with team tomorrow
   - family seems to agree with possible tracheostomy / PEG given likely
   long term vent at this time
   .
   #elevated INR:
   Elevated today in setting of heparin in cath lab. Trend coags daily.
   # thrombocytopenias:  Heme following and after [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2 positive but
   serotonin lab f/up negative, felt that overall unlikely true HIT
   was significantly lower on 2^nd PF4 assay. Platelets trending upwards.
   Final heme note in chart.
   - continue SC heparin for ppx
   - cont to trend, recently ~stable
   - likely ok to use in cardiology procedures
   # atrial tachycardia:
   HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   levophed and volume related
   - discussing restarting amio as above
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore
   - f/up local wound care recs
   - continue enzymatic debridement

   79 yo M critical AS, admitted to ICU with pneumonia, course complicated
   by recurrent HAP
    1.) Shock:  Likely combination of cardiogenic and distributive (likely
   from sepsis).  Warm extremities  and adequate CO suggests that
   distributive process dominates but low mVO2 suggests cardiogenic
   component still present.
   -Will hold off on inotrope trial given CO and warm periphery and his
   recent increase in urine output without inotropes.
   -Will still try to target some diureses with lasix gtt but will try to
   keep CVP at 12.
   -Will follow up on cultures and leave on broadend abx for now
   -LFTs, amylase/lipase not suggestive of an abdominal process.
   -Continue to trend PCWP today.
    2.)  AS:
   -Valve area increased post valvuloplasty, however, not clear that this
   is the cause of the hemodynamic improvement seen this AM (36-48 hours
   after valvuloplasty)
    3.) Repiratory Failure: Secondary to pneumonia and large effusion.
   -PSV trial today
   -Will wean PEEP as able.
    4.) Atrial tachycardia:  Currently off all rate control agents.
   Amiodarone if needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, complicated by recurrent healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with shock, likely a combination of cardiogenic and distributive (possibly due to sepsis). His vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and inadequate oxygenation. He is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient has undergone valvuloplasty, but the cause of the hemodynamic improvement is unclear. He also has respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and a large effusion. An atrial tachycardia has been identified and is currently off all rate control agents.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and cultures are pending. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient's kidney function appears to be normal, but liver enzymes are slightly elevated.

The patient's management plan includes holding off on inotropic therapy due to warm extremities and adequate cardiac output, targeting some diuresis with Lasix, and closely monitoring fluid balance. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued until cultures return. Further assessments will be done to evaluate the need for rate control agents for the atrial tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient's combination of cardiogenic and distributive shock increases the risk of organ dysfunction and failure, particularly in vital organs such as the"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M critical AS, admitted to ICU with pneumonia, course complicated
   by recurrent HAP
    1.) Shock:  Likely combination of cardiogenic and distributive (likely
   from sepsis).  Warm extremities  and adequate CO suggests that
   distributive process dominates but low mVO2 suggests cardiogenic
   component still present.
   -Will hold off on inotrope trial given CO and warm periphery and his
   recent increase in urine output without inotropes.
   -Will still try to target some diureses with lasix gtt but will try to
   keep CVP at 12.
   -Will follow up on cultures and leave on broadend abx for now
   -LFTs, amylase/lipase not suggestive of an abdominal process.
   -Continue to trend PCWP today.
    2.)  AS:
   -Valve area increased post valvuloplasty, however, not clear that this
   is the cause of the hemodynamic improvement seen this AM (36-48 hours
   after valvuloplasty)
    3.) Repiratory Failure: Secondary to pneumonia and large effusion.
   -PSV trial today
   -Will wean PEEP as able.
    4.) Atrial tachycardia:  Currently off all rate control agents.
   Amiodarone if needed.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a critical acute condition, admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and a course complicated by recurrent hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

Assessment and plan:
1.) Shock: The patient is likely experiencing a combination of cardiogenic and distributive shock, possibly due to sepsis. Warm extremities and adequate cardiac output suggest that the distributive process is dominant, but low mixed venous oxygen saturation indicates a cardiogenic component still present.
- The physician will hold off on initiating an inotropic trial, considering the patient's recent increase in urine output without inotropes.
- Lasix gtt will be continued, aiming to keep central venous pressure (CVP) at 12.
- Cultures will be followed up, and broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued for now.
- Liver function tests (LFTs) and amylase/lipase levels do not suggest an abdominal process.
- The physician will trend pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) today.

2.) Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient underwent valvuloplasty, resulting in an increased valve area. However, it is unclear if this procedure caused the hemodynamic improvement observed this morning (36-48 hours after valvuloplasty).

3.) Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pneumonia and a large effusion.
- Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) trial will be conducted today.

    1.) Shock:  Likely combination of cardiogenic and distributive (likely
   from sepsis).  Warm extremities  and adequate CO suggests that
   distributive process dominates but low mVO2 suggests cardiogenic
   component still present.
   -Will hold off on inotrope trial given CO and warm periphery and his
   recent increase in urine output without inotropes.
   -Will still try to target some diureses with lasix gtt but will try to
   keep CVP at 12.
   -Will follow up on cultures and leave on broadend abx for now
   -LFTs, amylase/lipase not suggestive of an abdominal process.
   -Continue to trend PCWP today.
    2.)  AS:
   -Valve area increased post valvuloplasty, however, not clear that this
   is the cause of the hemodynamic improvement seen this AM (36-48 hours
   after valvuloplasty)
    3.) Repiratory Failure: Secondary to pneumonia and large effusion.
   -PSV trial today
   -Will wean PEEP as able.
    4.) Atrial tachycardia:  Currently off all rate control agents.
   Amiodarone if needed.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   This afternoon
s wedge is 18 and lasix appropriately held for now as
   this is great filling pressure given that he
s still on pressors. His
   PAP is still high, likely due to pulm vasc remodeling and
   vasoconstriction in areas of lungs affected by his considerable
   pneumonia. Given his age, aortic stenosis, cardiac function, and
   severely abnl lungs, I suspect if plan is to pursue aggressive care
   that he will need trache.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, complicated by recurrent hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- The patient is currently in shock, likely due to a combination of cardiogenic and distributive causes, with warm extremities and adequate cardiac output suggesting a dominant distributive process possibly from sepsis.
- The patient underwent valvuloplasty, which increased valve area but the cause of hemodynamic improvement is unclear.
- The patient has respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and large effusion.
- The patient is experiencing atrial tachycardia, currently off all rate control agents.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock due to a combination of cardiogenic and distributive causes. Immediate medical intervention is required to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics.
2. Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has critical AS, which can lead to further complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias if not managed properly.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pneumonia and large effusion. This may require mechanical ventilation support and careful management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters.
4. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing atrial tachycardia, which can increase the workload on"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area. CO appears adequate currently  in the 5 range
 warm,
   appears to be perfusing peripherally.
   - check PCWPs q 8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 18 )
   - f/up any interventional cardiology recommendations
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O near negative~ 500cc to -1L
   , mainly keep CVP 10-12
   # Hypotension:
   Pressor requirements are decreased today
 increased slightly yesterday
   in setting of lower wedges, remains preload sensitive given his AS.
   Warm legs and lower SVRs more consistent with distributive etiology
   (sepsis), though lower CVO2 suggests cardiogenic component. Evidence
   for infection is fairly limited
 no fever, leukocytosis, or recent
   positive cultures
 though he has had more airway secretions over the
   weekend raising possibility of tracheobronchitis versus pna. L sacral
   wound does not appear infected.
   - Continue Meropenem (currently d16),  . Would favor DCing vancomycin
   Staph should have grown if present. Would also DC metronidazole, and if
   remains afebrile/no leukocytosis would also DC ciprofloxacin tomorrow.
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Decreased O2 requirements, now on PSV trial.
   Has persistent pulm edema, improved today
    L sided consolidation concerning for PNA versus organizing process,
   unclear.
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean  PEEP as tolerates
   - diuresis as above
   - family seems to agree with possible tracheostomy / PEG given likely
   long term vent at this time
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts down again significantly over the weekend in the setting of recent
   large heparin load for valvuloplasty and recently starting
   ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Previous work up for HIT thought false
   + PF4 antibody (decreased titer on repeat, negative serotonin release
   assay). DDX antibiotics, heparin, infection
   - hold heparin
   - streamlining antibiotics as above
   - follow daily CBC
   .
   #elevated INR:
   Elevated today in setting of heparin in cath lab. Trend coags daily.
   # atrial tachycardia:
   HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   levophed and volume related
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently intubated for respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and systolic congestive heart failure. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's pressor requirements have increased, indicating possible hypotension. This may be due to preload sensitivity related to his aortic stenosis or a distributive etiology such as sepsis.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be caused by heparin therapy, antibiotics, or infection. Further investigation for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is necessary.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent pulmonary edema and L-sided consolidation, raising concerns for pneumonia or an organizing process. Treatment for pneumonia should be continued, and weaning of PEEP should be done as tolerated.
4. Sacral Decubitus Sore: The patient has developed a sacral decubitus ulcer, which requires local wound care and evaluation by a plastic surgeon.
5. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated due to heparin therapy. Coagulation trends should be monitored daily.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is still intubated due to VAP, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes systolic CHF, hypotension, and potential worsening PNA. The medical team is monitoring the patient's central venous O2 saturation, urine output, and blood cultures. They are also managing the patient's respiratory failure, elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, and atrial tachycardia. The patient has a sacral decubitus sore and requires local wound care recommendations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening PNA (pneumonia): The patient's sputum production has increased, and there is concern for possible worsening of the pneumonia. Monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing warm, lower SVR, and distributive picture suggestive of infection or sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is crucial.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and requires weaning off mechanical ventilation. Monitoring of ABGs and adjusting PEEP as tolerated is important.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, and platelet counts are trending upwards. Continued monitoring of platelet levels and heparin therapy is necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is still intubated due to VAP, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes systolic CHF, hypotension, possible worsening pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and various pressors to maintain hemodynamics. There are concerns regarding the patient's elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, atrial tachycardia, and a sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient's overall prognosis remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's increased sputum production, slightly increased pressor requirement, and lack of leukocytosis or fevers suggest a possible worsening pneumonia. This could progress to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated and on assisted ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging, and there is a risk of prolonged ventilation or tracheostomy.
3. Cardiogenic Shock: With the patient's critical aortic stenosis and evidence of systolic CHF, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock, which can lead to inadequate cardiac output and organ perfusion.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area. CO appears adequate currently in the 5 range
 warm, appears
   to be perfusing peripherally.
   - checking  PCWPs q8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 20 now )
   - f/up any interventional cardiology recommendations
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O near negative~ 500cc to -1L
   , mainly keep CVP 10-12
   # Hypotension:
   Pressor requirements are decreased today
 increased slightly yesterday
   in setting of lower wedges, remains preload sensitive given his AS.
   Warm legs and lower SVRs more consistent with distributive etiology
   (sepsis), though lower CVO2 suggests cardiogenic component. Evidence
   for infection is fairly limited
 no fever, leukocytosis, or recent
   positive cultures
 though he has had more airway secretions over the
   weekend raising possibility of tracheobronchitis versus pna. L sacral
   wound does not appear infected.
   - Continue Meropenem (currently d16),  . Would favor DCing vancomycin
   Staph should have grown if present. Would also DC metronidazole, and if
   remains afebrile/no leukocytosis would also DC ciprofloxacin tomorrow.
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Decreased O2 requirements, now on PSV trial.
   Has persistent pulm edema, improved today
    L sided consolidation concerning for PNA versus organizing process,
   unclear.
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean  PEEP as tolerates , now at 8 from 10
   - diuresis as above
   - family seems to agree with possible tracheostomy / PEG given likely
   long term vent at this time
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts down again significantly over the weekend in the setting of recent
   large heparin load for valvuloplasty and recently starting
   ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Previous work up for HIT thought false
   + PF4 antibody (decreased titer on repeat, negative serotonin release
   assay). DDX antibiotics, heparin, infection. Restarted SQ heparin on
   4.13 (6d ago)
 4T score ~5, intermediate prob. No clinical evidence
   for new clot
   - discuss resending PF4 with heme
   - hold heparin
   - streamlining antibiotics as above
   - follow daily CBC
   .
   #Elevated INR:  Chronic issue.  Large heparin bolus with recent
   procedure which elevated coags recently.
   # atrial tachycardia:
   HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   levophed and volume related
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently intubated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's hemodynamics are stable with a decreasing central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), indicating improved cardiac function. The patient's blood pressure is still dependent on vasopressor support, but the dose has been decreased.

The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which may be related to recent large-dose heparin therapy for valvuloplasty and concurrent use of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. The platelet count is currently low, and there is concern for potential bleeding complications. The patient also has elevated INR due to chronic anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, with decreased oxygen requirements and successful trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV). However, there is persistent pulmonary edema and left-sided consolidation, which could be due to pneumonia or an organizing process. 

The patient's overall condition remains unstable, and the medical team is considering the possibility of tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to the likelihood of long-term ventilation."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area. CO appears adequate currently in the 5 range
 warm, appears
   to be perfusing peripherally.
   - checking  PCWPs q8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 20 now )
   - f/up any interventional cardiology recommendations
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O near negative~ 500cc to -1L
   , mainly keep CVP 10-12
   # Hypotension:
   Pressor requirements are decreased today
 increased slightly yesterday
   in setting of lower wedges, remains preload sensitive given his AS.
   Warm legs and lower SVRs more consistent with distributive etiology
   (sepsis), though lower CVO2 suggests cardiogenic component. Evidence
   for infection is fairly limited
 no fever, leukocytosis, or recent
   positive cultures
 though he has had more airway secretions over the
   weekend raising possibility of tracheobronchitis versus pna. L sacral
   wound does not appear infected.
   - conservative diuresis, keeping CVPs 10-12
   - Continue Meropenem (currently d16),  Will  d/c cipro and d/c
   vancomycin
 Staph should have grown if present. Would also DC
   metronidazole, and if remains afebrile/no leukocytosis would also DC
   [**Last Name (un) **] in [**1-7**] days.
   - send off repeat sputum Cx  today given some sputum discolorations
   overnight
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Decreased O2 requirements, now on PSV trial.
   Has persistent pulm edema, improved today
    L sided consolidation concerning for PNA versus organizing process,
   unclear.
   - pneumonia treatment as above / tapering now to just meropenem
   coverage
   - wean  PEEP as tolerates , now at 8 from 10
   - diuresis as above
   - family seems to agree with possible tracheostomy / PEG given likely
   long term vent at this time
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts down again significantly over the weekend in the setting of recent
   large heparin load for valvuloplasty and recently starting
   ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Previous work up for HIT thought false
   + PF4 antibody (decreased titer on repeat, negative serotonin release
   assay). DDX antibiotics, heparin, infection. Restarted SQ heparin on
   4.13 (6d ago)
 4T score ~5, intermediate prob. No clinical evidence
   for new clot
   - discuss resending PF4 with heme
   - holding heparin for now, using only pneumoboots for PPX for now
   - streamlining antibiotics as above
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC
   .
   #Elevated INR:  Chronic issue.  Large heparin bolus with recent
   procedure which elevated coags recently.
   - hold off on additional Vit K for now
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:
   HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   levophed and volume related
   - holding Amiodarone Rx for now given concern for underlying fibrosis
   changes
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement
   .
   #hemodynamic monitoring:
   - will plan to replace A-line today as current line not working
   appropriately

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently intubated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's hemodynamics are being closely monitored, with a focus on maintaining a CVP of 10-12 and PCWP of 16-20. The patient's pressor requirements have decreased, indicating some improvement. However, the patient still requires norepinephrine support.

The patient's respiratory status is being managed with a low tidal volume strategy and PEEP weaning as tolerated. The presence of pulmonary edema and left-sided consolidation raises concerns for pneumonia versus organizing process. Antibiotic coverage is being continued with meropenem, and other antibiotics are being discontinued based on the absence of growth in cultures.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to recent large heparin load for valvuloplasty and the initiation of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. There is no evidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), so heparin is being restarted.

The patient's elevated INR is a chronic issue and is likely due to chronic warfarin use. No additional vitamin K is being given at this time.

The patient's atrial tachycardia is being managed with a focus on weaning off levophed and potentially holding amiodarone.

The patient has a sacral decubitus sore, which is being managed with local wound care and enzymatic debridement.

Overall, the patient's medical complications include VAP, hypoxia, respiratory distress, potential pneumonia, thrombocytopenia, elevated INR, atrial tachycardia, and sacral decubitus sore. The patient remains critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area. CO appears adequate currently in the 5 range
 warm, appears
   to be perfusing peripherally.
   - checking  PCWPs q8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 20 now )
   - f/up any interventional cardiology recommendations
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O near negative~ 500cc to -1L
   , mainly keep CVP 10-12
   # Hypotension:
   Pressor requirements are decreased today
 increased slightly yesterday
   in setting of lower wedges, remains preload sensitive given his AS.
   Warm legs and lower SVRs more consistent with distributive etiology
   (sepsis), though lower CVO2 suggests cardiogenic component. Evidence
   for infection is fairly limited
 no fever, leukocytosis, or recent
   positive cultures
 though he has had more airway secretions over the
   weekend raising possibility of tracheobronchitis versus pna. L sacral
   wound does not appear infected.
   - conservative diuresis, keeping CVPs 10-12
   - Continue Meropenem (currently d16),  Will  d/c cipro and d/c
   vancomycin
 Staph should have grown if present. Would also DC
   metronidazole, and if remains afebrile/no leukocytosis would also DC
   [**Last Name (un) **] in [**1-7**] days.
   - send off repeat sputum Cx  today given some sputum discolorations
   overnight
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Decreased O2 requirements, now on PSV trial.
   Has persistent pulm edema, improved today
    L sided consolidation concerning for PNA versus organizing process,
   unclear.
   - pneumonia treatment as above / tapering now to just meropenem
   coverage
   - wean  PEEP as tolerates , now at 8 from 10
   - diuresis as above
   - family seems to agree with possible tracheostomy / PEG given likely
   long term vent at this time
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts down again significantly over the weekend in the setting of recent
   large heparin load for valvuloplasty and recently starting
   ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Previous work up for HIT thought false
   + PF4 antibody (decreased titer on repeat, negative serotonin release
   assay). DDX antibiotics, heparin, infection. Restarted SQ heparin on
   4.13 (6d ago)
 4T score ~5, intermediate prob. No clinical evidence
   for new clot
   - discuss resending PF4 with heme
   - holding heparin for now, using only pneumoboots for PPX for now
   - streamlining antibiotics as above
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC
   .
   #Elevated INR:  Chronic issue.  Large heparin bolus with recent
   procedure which elevated coags recently.
   - hold off on additional Vit K for now
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:
   HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   levophed and volume related
   - holding Amiodarone Rx for now given concern for underlying fibrosis
   changes
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and remains intubated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's hemodynamics have improved, with decreasing central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). The patient's systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) remains high, and cardiac output (CO) is maintained at around 5 liters per minute. The patient's urine output is good, with an average of 200 hours, but the platelet count has decreased significantly over the weekend.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. Pressor requirements have increased slightly recently.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent pulmonary edema and concerns for pneumonia versus organizing process. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to ongoing hypoxia and respiratory distress.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased again, which could be related to recent large heparin load for valvuloplasty and antibiotic use (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole). Further evaluation for HIT should be considered, and alternative methods for anticoagulation should be explored.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated due to chronic"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area. CO appears adequate currently  in the 5 range
 warm,
   appears to be perfusing peripherally.
   - check PCWPs q 8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 18 )
   - f/up any interventional cardiology recommendations
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O near negative~ 500cc to -1L
   , mainly keep CVP 10-12
   # Hypotension:
   Pressor requirements are decreased today
 increased slightly yesterday
   in setting of lower wedges, remains preload sensitive given his AS.
   Warm legs and lower SVRs more consistent with distributive etiology
   (sepsis), though lower CVO2 suggests cardiogenic component. Evidence
   for infection is fairly limited
 no fever, leukocytosis, or recent
   positive cultures
 though he has had more airway secretions over the
   weekend raising possibility of tracheobronchitis versus pna. L sacral
   wound does not appear infected.
   - Continue Meropenem (currently d16),  . Would favor DCing vancomycin
   Staph should have grown if present. Would also DC metronidazole, and if
   remains afebrile/no leukocytosis would also DC ciprofloxacin tomorrow.
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Decreased O2 requirements, now on PSV trial.
   Has persistent pulm edema, improved today
    L sided consolidation concerning for PNA versus organizing process,
   unclear.
   - pneumonia treatment as above
   - wean  PEEP as tolerates
   - diuresis as above
   - family seems to agree with possible tracheostomy / PEG given likely
   long term vent at this time
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts down again significantly over the weekend in the setting of recent
   large heparin load for valvuloplasty and recently starting
   ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Previous work up for HIT thought false
   + PF4 antibody (decreased titer on repeat, negative serotonin release
   assay). DDX antibiotics, heparin, infection. Restarted SQ heparin on
   4.13 (6d ago)
 4T score ~5, intermediate prob. No clinical evidence
   for new clot
   - discuss resending PF4 with heme
   - hold heparin
   - streamlining antibiotics as above
   - follow daily CBC
   .
   #elevated INR:
   Elevated today in setting of heparin in cath lab. Trend coags daily.
   # atrial tachycardia:
   HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   levophed and volume related
   - continue amio
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently intubated for respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Critical AS/Systolic CHF: The patient has undergone valvuloplasty, which appears to have had a good effect on the valve area. The patient's cardiac output seems adequate at around 5 liters per minute. The goal is to keep the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) around 18 mmHg, limit tachycardia if possible, and continue the furosemide drip to maintain a negative fluid balance of around -500 to -1000 cc.

2. Hypotension: The patient's pressor requirements have increased slightly recently, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may be due to preload sensitivity caused by his aortic stenosis. The lower central venous oxygen saturation (CVO2) suggests a cardiogenic component, but the warm legs and lower systemic vascular resistance (SVR) suggest a distributive etiology, such as sepsis. There is limited evidence of infection, so it is important to continue meropenem and discontinue vancomycin, metronidazole, and ciprofloxacin if the patient remains afebrile and without leukocytosis.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen requirements have decreased, and they are currently on pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently intubated due to VAP, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition has improved with the valvuloplasty, and cardiac output appears adequate. However, there are several ongoing concerns including hypotension, pneumonia, respiratory failure, elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, and atrial tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis or infection, as evidenced by increased sputum production and slightly increased pressor requirement. Close monitoring of vital signs and ongoing assessment of infection markers are necessary.

2. Pneumonia: The patient shows signs of consolidation on the left side, which could indicate pneumonia. This should be treated with appropriate antibiotics and respiratory support.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator should be done cautiously, considering the risk of further respiratory failure. Repeated ABGs and assessment of lung function are crucial.

4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, which may be due to heparin therapy. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary to avoid bleeding complications.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which could be caused"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and pulmonary fibrosis who initially presented with pneumonia. He now has a prolonged hospital stay due to septic and cardiogenic shock. The patient is intubated and sedated, and his vital signs are unstable with low blood pressure, tachycardia, and tachypnea. He is receiving multiple medications including vasopressor, sedatives, pain medication, diuretics, and antibiotics. The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies show evidence of fluid overload. The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of his cardiogenic shock, infection, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial tachycardia, and sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated PCWP indicate possible cardiogenic shock. This condition can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure if not properly managed.
2. Septic shock: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and negative sputum cultures suggest a possible ongoing infection leading to septic shock. This can result in systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support and abnormal ABG values indicate respiratory failure. This can lead to hypoxemia and hypercapnia if not adequately managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with history of AS, pulmonary fibrosis who initially presented
   with pneumonia, now with prolonged hospital stay c/b septic and
   cardiogenic shock
   1. HoTN: likely mixed cardiogenic and septic picture, currently most
   likely cardiogenic with low EF, AS, preload dependence.  Elevated PCWP
   with volume overload and he may be overdistended impairing EF.
    - Will diurese and aim for CVP 10-12, PCWP 18
   2. ? infection: sputum culture remains negative todate
    - will d/c vancomycin, flagyl and cipro
    - day 16 meropenem
    - will obtain repeat sputum cultures today, if negative will d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   tomorrow
   3. Respiratory failure: likely related to volume overload but has
   underlying recovering pneumonia as well as possible history of
   pulmonary fibrosis
    - cont diuresis for now
    - cont PSV and attempt to wean vent as tolerated
   4. Thrombocytopenia: likely medication related, but will cont to
   follow, now stopping vancomycin
   5. Atrial tachycardia:
   - cont lopressor
    - holding amiodarone given possible underlying lung disease
   6. Sacral decubitus ulcer: per nursing care appears more inflammed,
   will have plastic surgery attempt

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis and pulmonary fibrosis who initially presented with pneumonia. He has now developed septic and cardiogenic shock due to a prolonged hospital stay. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, tachypnea, and respiratory failure. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient has thrombocytopenia and an atrial tachycardia. He also has a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates potential inadequate tissue perfusion, which can lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Tachypnea: The patient's rapid breathing rate suggests respiratory distress or inadequate oxygenation. It may be due to underlying pneumonia or pulmonary fibrosis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition indicates possible respiratory failure, which could be caused by volume overload, underlying pneumonia, or pulmonary fibrosis. Continuous diuresis and weaning off mechanical ventilation will be attempted.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be medication-related. Monitoring and discontinuing potential causative agents will be necessary.
5. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may indicate an atrial tachycardia. Continuing"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with history of AS, pulmonary fibrosis who initially presented
   with pneumonia, now with prolonged hospital stay c/b septic and
   cardiogenic shock
   1. HoTN: likely mixed cardiogenic and septic picture, currently most
   likely cardiogenic with low EF, AS, preload dependence.  Elevated PCWP
   with volume overload and he may be overdistended impairing EF.
    - Will diurese and aim for CVP 10-12, PCWP 18
   2. ? infection: sputum culture remains negative todate
    - will d/c vancomycin, flagyl and cipro
    - day 16 meropenem
    - will obtain repeat sputum cultures today, if negative will d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   tomorrow
   3. Respiratory failure: likely related to volume overload but has
   underlying recovering pneumonia as well as possible history of
   pulmonary fibrosis
    - cont diuresis for now
    - cont PSV and attempt to wean vent as tolerated
   4. Thrombocytopenia: likely medication related, but will cont to
   follow, now stopping vancomycin
   5. Atrial tachycardia:
   - cont lopressor
    - holding amiodarone given possible underlying lung disease
   6. Sacral decubitus ulcer: per nursing care appears more inflammed,
   will have plastic surgery attempt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and remains intubated due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's platelet count dropped to 47,000/mL, and heparin was discontinued. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K were administered. The patient will have his Swan-Ganz catheter removed today and will be transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for placement of a percutaneous endotracheal tube (PEG) and tracheostomy (trach).

24-hour events:
- A new arterial line was inserted over a wire.
- The patient's platelet count dropped significantly, leading to the discontinuation of heparin.
- FFP and vitamin K were given due to recent drops in coagulation parameters.
- The patient's Swan-Ganz catheter will be removed today.
- The patient will undergo a trach and PEG placement in the ICU.

Allergies:
No known drug allergies.

Medical History:
The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, for which he underwent valvuloplasty.

Current Medications:
- Fentanyl (concentrate) infusion at 40 mcg/hour.
- Midazolam (Versed) infusion at 1 mg/hour.
- Furosemide (Lasix) infusion"

   Assessment and Plan:
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area (.4
.9cm2). CO appears adequate currently in the 5 range
   warm, appears to be perfusing peripherally.  Overnight he had improved
   MAPs. PCWP still averaging 20 now.
   - checking  PCWPs q8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 20 now )
   - f/up any interventional cardiology recommendations
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O -1L which he achieved
   overnight , keeping  CVP goal near [**10-17**]
   # Hypotension: Pressor requirements increased today slightly in setting
   of needing more sedation overnight. Wedges remain in 20 range, he still
   remains quite preload sensitive given his AS. Warm legs and lower SVRs
   more consistent with distributive etiology (sepsis), though lower CVO2
   suggests cardiogenic component.  Currently, his evidence for infection
   is fairly limited
with no new fevers, leukocytosis, or recent positive
   cultures
 though he has had more airway secretions over the weekend
   raising possibility of tracheobronchitis versus PNA so some antibiotics
   were continued. L sacral wound does not appear infected.
   .
   - conservative diuresis, keeping CVPs 10-12  ( goal I/o neg 500 to neg
   1L if tolerates)
   - Continue Meropenem (currently d17),  yesterday team  d/c cipro, d/c
   Flagyl & d/c vancomycin  (as staph should have grown if present).
   - consider  d/c Meropenem if remains afebrile and with no e/o
   leukocytosis
   - f/up recent sputum Cx
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Decreasing O2 requirements, now on PSV trial.
   Has persistent pulm edema, improved today
    L sided consolidation concerning for PNA versus organizing process,
   unclear.
   - pneumonia treatment as above / tapering now to just meropenem
   coverage
   - wean  PEEP as tolerates , now at 8 from 10
   - diuresis as above
   - family seems to agree with possible tracheostomy / PEG given likely
   long term vent at this time
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts down again significantly over the weekend in the setting of recent
   large heparin load for valvuloplasty and recently starting
   ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Previous work up for HIT thought false
   + PF4 antibody (decreased titer on repeat, negative serotonin release
   assay). DDX antibiotics, heparin, infection. Restarted SQ heparin on
   4.13 (6d ago)
 4T score ~5, intermediate prob. No clinical evidence
   for new clots.
   .
   - discussed w/heme and plan was to resend PF4
f/up results
   - holding heparin for now, using only pneumoboots for PPX for now
   - will get Vit K and FFP before PEG and trach today
   - streamlining antibiotics as above
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC
   .
   #Elevated INR /coags :  Chronic issue.  Large heparin bolus with recent
   procedure which elevated coags recently.
   - will give additional Vit K  and FFP today before procedures
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:
   - HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   Levophed and volume related
   - holding Amiodarone Rx for now given concern for underlying fibrosis
   changes
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently intubated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing hypotension and the need for vasopressor support. There are concerns about infection, including possible tracheobronchitis or pneumonia, as well as thrombocytopenia due to recent heparin exposure. The patient has an elevated INR and coagulopathy requiring correction before procedures. Additionally, the patient has atrial tachycardia, a sacral decubitus ulcer, and requires nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia indicate a high risk of worsening respiratory failure, which could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's symptoms suggest the possibility of tracheobronchitis or pneumonia. Continued antibiotic coverage is necessary, and close monitoring for signs of infection is important.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to recent heparin exposure. Further investigation and management are required to address this issue and prevent bleeding complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and coagulopathy need to be corrected before any procedures to minimize the risk of bleeding.
5. Atrial tachycardia: The patient's heart rate may continue to be uncontrolled, potentially leading to further cardiac complications.
6. Sacral decubitus sore: The presence of a sacral decubitus ulcer requires ongoing wound care and attention to prevent infection and promote healing.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information and clinical findings may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment and accurate prediction of potential complications."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. They have a history of thrombocytopenia and have received blood transfusions. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. They are on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and have a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 210. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding or bruising.
2. Infection: The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and the presence of a tracheostomy increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney dysfunction.
4. Liver dysfunction: The abnormal liver enzyme levels indicate possible liver dysfunction.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor organ perfusion and increased risk of organ damage.
6. Thromboembolism: The patient's immobility due to mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
7. Stress ulcers: Prolonged critical illness"

   Assessment and Plan:
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress  with plan for
   trach/PEG today and awaiting AVR.
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area (.4
.9cm2). CO appears adequate currently in the 5 range
   warm, appears to be perfusing peripherally.  Overnight he had improved
   MAPs. PCWP still averaging 20 now.
   - checking  PCWPs q8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 20 now )
   - pull swan today
   - f/up CT surgery regarding possible date for AVR
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O -1L which he achieved
   overnight , keeping  CVP goal near [**10-17**]
   # Hypotension: Pressor requirements increased today slightly in setting
   of needing more sedation overnight. Wedges remain in 20 range, he still
   remains quite preload sensitive given his AS. Warm legs and lower SVRs
   more consistent with distributive etiology (sepsis), though lower CVO2
   suggests cardiogenic component.  No evidence of  new septic physiology.
   No fevers off other antbiotics
   - conservative diuresis, keeping CVPs 10-12  ( goal I/o neg 500 to neg
   1L if tolerates)
   - DC meropenem today
   - consider  d/c Meropenem if remains afebrile and with no e/o
   leukocytosis
   - f/up recent sputum Cx
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Decreasing O2 requirements, now on PSV trial.
   Has persistent pulm edema, improved today
    L sided consolidation concerning for PNA versus organizing process,
   unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 6**] been tolerating PEEP of 8
   - getting trach/PEG today, will continue to wean while on trach
   - diuresis as above with goal 1L out
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts down again significantly over the weekend in the setting of recent
   large heparin load for valvuloplasty and recently starting
   ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Previous work up for HIT thought false
   + PF4 antibody (decreased titer on repeat, negative serotonin release
   assay). DDX antibiotics, heparin, infection. Restarted SQ heparin on
   4.13 (6d ago)
 4T score ~5, intermediate prob. No clinical evidence
   for new clots.
   - heme following
   - f/u resent PF4
   - holding heparin for now, using only pneumoboots for PPX for now
   - will get Vit K and FFP before PEG and trach today
   - streamlining antibiotics as above
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC
   .
   #Elevated INR /coags :  Chronic issue.  Large heparin bolus with recent
   procedure which elevated coags recently.
   - will give additional Vit K  and FFP today before procedures
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:  No tachycardia off of amiodarone
   - HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   Levophed and volume related
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore : looking slightly worse per nursing
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement
   - call plastics for reeval today

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently intubated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is scheduled for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today and is awaiting an aortic valve replacement (AVR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension despite pressor support. This could be due to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or preload sensitivity.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent pulmonary edema and is at risk for further respiratory failure. There is also a concern for pneumonia or an organizing process in the left lung.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly, possibly due to heparin usage and antibiotics.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and abnormal coagulation profile, likely due to the large heparin bolus given during the procedure.
5. Sacral Decubitus Sore: The patient has developed a sacral decubitus sore, which requires wound care and may require evaluation by plastics.
6. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing atrial tachycardia, which may be related to Levophed and volume status.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is still intubated due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's platelet count dropped to 47, and he received a transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. The patient will have his Swan-Ganz catheter removed today and will be taken to the interventional radiology (IR) department for placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube and tracheostomy (trach). The patient has no known drug allergies.

   Assessment and Plan:
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area. CO appears adequate currently in the 5 range
 warm, appears
   to be perfusing peripherally.
   - checking  PCWPs q8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 20 now )
   - f/up any interventional cardiology recommendations
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O near negative~ 500cc to -1L
   , mainly keep CVP 10-12
   # Hypotension:
   Pressor requirements are decreased today
 increased slightly yesterday
   in setting of lower wedges, remains preload sensitive given his AS.
   Warm legs and lower SVRs more consistent with distributive etiology
   (sepsis), though lower CVO2 suggests cardiogenic component. Evidence
   for infection is fairly limited
 no fever, leukocytosis, or recent
   positive cultures
 though he has had more airway secretions over the
   weekend raising possibility of tracheobronchitis versus pna. L sacral
   wound does not appear infected.
   - conservative diuresis, keeping CVPs 10-12
   - Continue Meropenem (currently d16),  Will  d/c cipro and d/c
   vancomycin
 Staph should have grown if present. Would also DC
   metronidazole, and if remains afebrile/no leukocytosis would also DC
   [**Last Name (un) **] in [**1-7**] days.
   - send off repeat sputum Cx  today given some sputum discolorations
   overnight
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Decreased O2 requirements, now on PSV trial.
   Has persistent pulm edema, improved today
    L sided consolidation concerning for PNA versus organizing process,
   unclear.
   - pneumonia treatment as above / tapering now to just meropenem
   coverage
   - wean  PEEP as tolerates , now at 8 from 10
   - diuresis as above
   - family seems to agree with possible tracheostomy / PEG given likely
   long term vent at this time
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts down again significantly over the weekend in the setting of recent
   large heparin load for valvuloplasty and recently starting
   ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Previous work up for HIT thought false
   + PF4 antibody (decreased titer on repeat, negative serotonin release
   assay). DDX antibiotics, heparin, infection. Restarted SQ heparin on
   4.13 (6d ago)
 4T score ~5, intermediate prob. No clinical evidence
   for new clot
   - discuss resending PF4 with heme
   - holding heparin for now, using only pneumoboots for PPX for now
   - streamlining antibiotics as above
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC
   .
   #Elevated INR:  Chronic issue.  Large heparin bolus with recent
   procedure which elevated coags recently.
   - hold off on additional Vit K for now
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:
   HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   levophed and volume related
   - holding Amiodarone Rx for now given concern for underlying fibrosis
   changes
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement
   .
   #hemodynamic monitoring:
   - will plan to replace A-line today as current line not working
   appropriately

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is still intubated due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and persistent pulmonary edema indicate ongoing respiratory failure. There is a concern for pneumonia versus organizing process on the left side. The plan includes weaning PEEP, diuresis, and continued coverage with meropenem.

2. Hypotension: The patient has required increased pressor support, which suggests hypotension. The cause could be septic shock, cardiogenic shock due to aortic stenosis, or both. Conservative diuresis and continued use of vasopressors are planned.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly over the weekend, possibly due to recent large heparin load for valvuloplasty and antibiotic use. HIT has been considered but is now thought to be negative. The patient will be monitored for signs of new clot formation.

4. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated INR, likely due to chronic heparin use. Vitamin K administration is being"

   Assessment and Plan:
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area (.4
.9cm2). CO appears adequate currently in the 5 range
   warm, appears to be perfusing peripherally.  Overnight he had improved
   MAPs. PCWP still averaging 20 now.
   - checking  PCWPs q8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 20 now )
   - f/up any interventional cardiology recommendations
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O -1L which he achieved
   overnight , keeping  CVP goal near [**10-17**]
   # Hypotension: Pressor requirements increased today slightly in setting
   of needing more sedation overnight. Wedges remain in 20 range, he still
   remains quite preload sensitive given his AS. Warm legs and lower SVRs
   more consistent with distributive etiology (sepsis), though lower CVO2
   suggests cardiogenic component.  Currently, his evidence for infection
   is fairly limited
with no new fevers, leukocytosis, or recent positive
   cultures
 though he has had more airway secretions over the weekend
   raising possibility of tracheobronchitis versus PNA so some antibiotics
   were continued. L sacral wound does not appear infected.
   .
   - conservative diuresis, keeping CVPs 10-12  ( goal I/o neg 500 to neg
   1L if tolerates)
   - Continue Meropenem (currently d17),  yesterday team  d/c cipro, d/c
   Flagyl & d/c vancomycin  (as staph should have grown if present).
   - consider  d/c Meropenem if remains afebrile and with no e/o
   leukocytosis
   - f/up recent sputum Cx
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  Decreasing O2 requirements, now on PSV trial.
   Has persistent pulm edema, improved today
    L sided consolidation concerning for PNA versus organizing process,
   unclear.
   - pneumonia treatment as above / tapering now to just meropenem
   coverage
   - wean  PEEP as tolerates , now at 8 from 10
   - diuresis as above
   - family seems to agree with possible tracheostomy / PEG given likely
   long term vent at this time
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts down again significantly over the weekend in the setting of recent
   large heparin load for valvuloplasty and recently starting
   ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Previous work up for HIT thought false
   + PF4 antibody (decreased titer on repeat, negative serotonin release
   assay). DDX antibiotics, heparin, infection. Restarted SQ heparin on
   4.13 (6d ago)
 4T score ~5, intermediate prob. No clinical evidence
   for new clots.
   .
   - discussed w/heme and plan was to resend PF4
f/up results
   - holding heparin for now, using only pneumoboots for PPX for now
   - will get Vit K and FFP before PEG and trach today
   - streamlining antibiotics as above
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC
   .
   #Elevated INR /coags :  Chronic issue.  Large heparin bolus with recent
   procedure which elevated coags recently.
   - will give additional Vit K  and FFP today before procedures
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:
   - HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   Levophed and volume related
   - holding Amiodarone Rx for now given concern for underlying fibrosis
   changes
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and remains intubated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been unstable with episodes of hypotension and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). He also has thrombocytopenia, elevated INR/coagulopathy, and an atrial tachycardia. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, suggesting an ongoing infection. The patient's family has agreed to a possible tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) given the likely long-term mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to experience respiratory distress despite being on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for persistent pulmonary edema and the possibility of pneumonia versus organizing process on the left side.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and there has been an increase in the need for vasopressors. The patient's preload sensitivity and lower systemic vascular resistance suggest a cardiogenic component to the hypotension, possibly due to the critical aortic stenosis.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly, likely due to the large heparin load for the valvuloplast"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis and pulmonary fibrosis who presented initially with pneumonia. He now has a prolonged hospital stay complicated by septic and cardiogenic shock. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial tachycardia, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to mixed cardiogenic and septic shock. This could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying recovering pneumonia along with possible pulmonary fibrosis, which could contribute to his respiratory failure. This could worsen if not managed properly and may result in further lung complications.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count is likely medication-related, specifically related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). This condition needs to be monitored closely as it increases the risk of bleeding.

4. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing an atrial tachycardia, which may be related to his critical illness. It is important to continue managing this arrhythmia to prevent complications such as heart rhythm disturbances or cardiac strain.

5. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has developed a sacral dec"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with history of AS, pulmonary fibrosis who initially presented
   with pneumonia, now with prolonged hospital stay c/b septic and
   cardiogenic shock.
    #. HoTN: likely mixed cardiogenic and septic picture, currently most
   likely cardiogenic with low EF, AS, preload dependence.  Elevated PCWP
   with volume overload and he may be overdistended impairing EF.
   Increased pressor requirement overnight in setting of increased
   sedation.
   - Will diurese and aim for CVP 10-12, on lasix gtt
   - D/c PA line today
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   #. ID: sputum culture remains negative todate
    - D/c vancomycin, flagyl and cipro [**4-24**]
    - D/c meropenem today (completed 17 day course)
    - Yeast in sputum / urine. S/p foley change. Glucan 49. No plans to
   treat for now.
   #. Respiratory failure: likely related to volume overload but has
   underlying recovering pneumonia as well as possible history of
   pulmonary fibrosis
    - Cont diuresis for now
    - Trach today with FFP and Vit K
    - Cont PSV trials and attempt to wean vent as tolerated after trach
   #. Thrombocytopenia: likely medication related, but will cont to
   follow, now off vancomycin
   - F/U PF4, hold heparin until back
   - Trend platelet counts [**Hospital1 **]
   #. Atrial tachycardia: Stable
    - No BB given pressor requirement
    - Holding amiodarone given possible underlying lung disease
   #. Sacral decubitus ulcer: per nursing care appears more inflammed,
   will have plastic surgery attempt debridement, wound care recs
   #. Critical AS: S/p valvuloplasty [**4-21**]. No immediate plan for AVR. CT
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] following.
   #. FEN: PEG today.
   #. GOC: Full code, but family aware of poor prognosis.

   with pneumonia, now with prolonged hospital stay c/b septic and
   cardiogenic shock.
    #. HoTN: likely mixed cardiogenic and septic picture, currently most
   likely cardiogenic with low EF, AS, preload dependence.  Elevated PCWP
   with volume overload and he may be overdistended impairing EF.
   Increased pressor requirement overnight in setting of increased
   sedation.

    - Yeast in sputum / urine. S/p foley change. Glucan 49. No plans to
   treat for now.
   #. Respiratory failure: likely related to volume overload but has
   underlying recovering pneumonia as well as possible history of
   pulmonary fibrosis
    - Cont diuresis for now

   trach/PEG today and awaiting AVR.
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area (.4
.9cm2). CO appears adequate currently in the 5 range
   warm, appears to be perfusing peripherally.  Overnight he had improved
   MAPs. PCWP still averaging 20 now.
   - checking  PCWPs q8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 20 now )
   - pull swan today
   - f/up CT surgery regarding possible date for AVR
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O -1L which he achieved
   overnight , keeping  CVP goal near [**10-17**]
   # Hypotension: Pressor requirements increased today slightly in setting
   of needing more sedation overnight. Wedges remain in 20 range, he still
   remains quite preload sensitive given his AS. Warm legs and lower SVRs
   more consistent with distributive etiology (sepsis), though lower CVO2
   suggests cardiogenic component.  No evidence of  new septic physiology.
   No fevers off other antbiotics
   - conservative diuresis, keeping CVPs 10-12  ( goal I/o neg 500 to neg
   1L if tolerates)
   - DC meropenem today
   - consider  d/c Meropenem if remains afebrile and with no e/o
   leukocytosis
   - f/up recent sputum Cx
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p trach/PEG yesterday
   - continue to wean while on trach
   - diuresis as above with goal 1L out
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts down again significantly over the weekend in the setting of recent
   large heparin load for valvuloplasty and recently starting
   ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Previous work up for HIT thought false
   + PF4 antibody (decreased titer on repeat, negative serotonin release
   assay). DDX antibiotics, heparin, infection. Restarted SQ heparin on
   4.13 (6d ago)
 4T score ~5, intermediate prob. No clinical evidence
   for new clots.
   - heme following
   - f/u resent PF4
   - holding heparin for now, using only pneumoboots for PPX for now
   - will get Vit K and FFP before PEG and trach today
   - streamlining antibiotics as above
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC
   .
   #Elevated INR /coags :  Chronic issue.  Large heparin bolus with recent
   procedure which elevated coags recently.
   - will give additional Vit K  and FFP today before procedures
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:  No tachycardia off of amiodarone
   - HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   Levophed and volume related
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore : looking slightly worse per nursing
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement
   - call plastics for reeval today

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is still intubated due to VAP, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient is planned for tracheostomy and PEG tube placement today and is awaiting an upcoming AVR surgery. The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, elevated INR/coagulopathy, and atrial tachycardia. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, argatroban, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, vecuronium, midazolam, and lasix. The patient's recent lab results show hypernatremia, leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the pressor requirements have increased. There is a concern for cardiogenic shock due to critical aortic stenosis and possible septic shock. The CVP is within the desired range, but the patient remains preload sensitive.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to VAP, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. Weaning off the ventilator while on tracheostomy will be considered.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, possibly due to a large"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress  with plan for
   trach/PEG today and awaiting AVR.
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area (.4
.9cm2). CO appears adequate currently in the 5 range
   warm, appears to be perfusing peripherally.  Overnight he had improved
   MAPs. PCWP still averaging 20 now.
   - checking  PCWPs q8 hours ( coming down from 24 to 20 now )
   - pull swan today
   - f/up CT surgery regarding possible date for AVR
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O -1L which he achieved
   overnight , keeping  CVP goal near [**10-17**]
   # Hypotension: Pressor requirements increased today slightly in setting
   of needing more sedation overnight. Wedges remain in 20 range, he still
   remains quite preload sensitive given his AS. Warm legs and lower SVRs
   more consistent with distributive etiology (sepsis), though lower CVO2
   suggests cardiogenic component.  No evidence of  new septic physiology.
   No fevers off other antbiotics
   - conservative diuresis, keeping CVPs 10-12  ( goal I/o neg 500 to neg
   1L if tolerates)
   - DC meropenem today
   - consider  d/c Meropenem if remains afebrile and with no e/o
   leukocytosis
   - f/up recent sputum Cx
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
 check PM levels
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p trach/PEG yesterday
   - continue to wean while on trach
   - diuresis as above with goal 1L out
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts down again significantly over the weekend in the setting of recent
   large heparin load for valvuloplasty and recently starting
   ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. Previous work up for HIT thought false
   + PF4 antibody (decreased titer on repeat, negative serotonin release
   assay). DDX antibiotics, heparin, infection. Restarted SQ heparin on
   4.13 (6d ago)
 4T score ~5, intermediate prob. No clinical evidence
   for new clots.
   - heme following
   - f/u resent PF4
   - holding heparin for now, using only pneumoboots for PPX for now
   - will get Vit K and FFP before PEG and trach today
   - streamlining antibiotics as above
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC
   .
   #Elevated INR /coags :  Chronic issue.  Large heparin bolus with recent
   procedure which elevated coags recently.
   - will give additional Vit K  and FFP today before procedures
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:  No tachycardia off of amiodarone
   - HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   Levophed and volume related
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore : looking slightly worse per nursing
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement
   - call plastics for reeval today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently intubated. He has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hypoxia. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, argatroban, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, vecuronium, midazolam, and lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's pressor requirements have increased slightly, indicating ongoing hypotension. It is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust the pressor medications as needed to maintain adequate perfusion.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to recent large heparin load for valvuloplasty, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. HIT should be ruled out, and further evaluation by hematology is recommended.

3. Elevated INR/coags: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, possibly due to the recent heparin bolus. Additional vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be administered before any procedures.

4. Sacral decubitus sore: The patient has developed a pressure ulcer on the sacrum. Local wound care recommendations and evaluation by plastics are advised.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require ventilatory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently intubated in the ICU. He has a history of respiratory failure, hypoxia, and respiratory distress, as well as hypotension, thrombocytopenia, elevated INR/coagulopathy, atrial tachycardia, and a sacral decubitus sore. The patient is also experiencing hypoxia and has been placed on a ventilator. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures are being taken to prevent this, including the implementation of a VAP bundle and restraints while intubated.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to recent large heparin load for valvuloplasty and antibiotic use (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole). Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of thrombocytopenia, and appropriate measures will be taken to address it.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he requires pressor support. The cause of hypotension is multifactorial, including cardiogenic and distributive causes. Conservative diuresis and careful monitoring of fluid balance will be continued to manage this condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress  with plan for
   trach/PEG today and awaiting AVR.
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area (.4
.9cm2). Appears to be perfusing well at this time.
   - f/up CT surgery regarding possible date for AVR; awaiting heme recs.
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O -1L, CVP 10-12
   # Hypotension:
   Likely related to critical AS, no evidence of active infection
   currently. [**Month (only) 8**] be a contribution from sedatives.
   - Diuresis as above
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   - check AM cortisol
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p trach/PEG yesterday
   - continue to wean while on trach
   - diuresis as above with goal 1L out
   - PSV trial
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts stable. Repeat PF4 positive but titer and serotonin release assay
   are pending.
   - heme following
   - continue argatroban
   - f/u resent PF4 titer, serotonin release assay
   - holding heparin
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:
   Likely related to pressors, also consider anxiety and pain contribution
   - HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   Levophed and volume related
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   - ativan prn, morphine prn
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore : looking slightly worse per nursing
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement
   - call plastics for reeval today
   # Hypernatremia
   - D5W while tube feeds on hold

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently intubated. The patient has a history of VAP, hypoxia, respiratory distress, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and an atrial tachycardia. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, argatroban, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, vecuronium, midazolam, and lasix. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. The patient's laboratory results indicate hypernatremia, anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer and is awaiting an aortic valve replacement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to prolonged intubation and ventilation.
2. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is already present.
3. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and anticoagulation therapy with argatroban.
4. Renal failure due to hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion.
5. Hepatic dysfunction indicated by elevated liver enzymes.
6. Poor glycemic control, as evidenced by previous high blood glucose levels.
7. Pressure ulcers, particularly the sacral decubitus ulcer that is worsening.
8. Cardiac complications related to critical aortic st"

    - Yeast in sputum / urine. S/p foley change. Glucan 49. No plans to
   treat for now.
   #. Respiratory failure: likely related to volume overload but has
   underlying recovering pneumonia as well as possible history of
   pulmonary fibrosis
    - Cont diuresis for now
    - Trach today with FFP and Vit K
    - Cont PSV trials and attempt to wean vent as tolerated after trach
   #. Thrombocytopenia: likely medication related, but will cont to
   follow, now off vancomycin
   - F/U PF4, hold heparin until HIT Ab is back
   - Trend platelet counts [**Hospital1 **]
   #. Atrial tachycardia: Stable
    - No BB given pressor requirement
    - Holding amiodarone given possible underlying lung disease
   #. Sacral decubitus ulcer: per nursing care appears more inflammed,
   will have plastic surgery attempt debridement, wound care recs
   #. Critical AS: S/p valvuloplasty [**4-21**]. No immediate plan for AVR. CT

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and pulmonary fibrosis who initially presented with pneumonia. He now has a prolonged hospital stay due to septic and cardiogenic shock.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:

1. Hypotension (HoTN): The patient has low blood pressure, which may be due to a mixed cardiogenic and septic picture. The elevated PCWP indicates volume overload, and the patient may be overdistended, impairing his left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). Increased pressor requirement overnight suggests that he may be experiencing increased sedation.

2. Infection (ID): Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's sputum culture remains negative to date. The yeast in sputum/urine and elevated glucan level indicate possible fungal infection, but no plans to treat for now.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has underlying recovering pneumonia, along with possible pulmonary fibrosis, contributing to respiratory failure. Diuretic therapy and tracheostomy have been planned to manage this condition.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is likely medication-related. It is important to monitor platelet counts and consider alternative anticoagulation options until HIT antibodies are ruled out.

5. Atrial tachycardia: The patient is stable with an atrial"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis and pulmonary fibrosis who initially presented with pneumonia. He now has a prolonged hospital stay due to septic and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent valvuloplasty and has improved diuresis, as well as having a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension (HoTN): The patient initially had a mixed cardiogenic and septic picture, which is now most likely cardiogenic in nature. The plan is to diurese and aim for central venous pressure (CVP) of 10-12, titrate lasix gtt, wean levophed as tolerated, and obtain AM cortisol.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has underlying recovering pneumonia, along with possible pulmonary fibrosis. The plan includes continuing diuresis, transitioning to pressure support ventilation (PSV), attempting to wean from the ventilator/spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) as tolerated, and completing the course of antibiotics.

3. Critical aortic stenosis: The patient underwent valvuloplasty on [**4-21**], with no immediate plan for aortic valve replacement (AVR). A CT scan has been ordered, and [**Doctor First Name 91**] will sign off until after"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and pulmonary fibrosis.
- Initially presented with pneumonia and now has prolonged hospital stay due to septic and cardiogenic shock.
- Underwent valvuloplasty and improved diuresis.
- Tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedation.
- Has a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) with positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibodies.
- Argatroban, a medication, has been started.
- The patient's blood pressure is low, and they are dependent on norepinephrine for hemodynamic support.
- There are concerns about fluid overload and respiratory failure.
- Hypernatremia is present, and the patient's sodium level needs to be managed.
- The patient has a history of atrial tachycardia.
- Code status is full code, but the family is aware of the poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation included cardiogenic shock, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Septic shock: The patient also has a history of septic shock, which can cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiple organ dysfunction"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty but remains intubated due to recent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient has also undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is planned but is on hold until the respiratory status improves.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, as evidenced by ongoing hypoxia and the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential respiratory failure.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to platelet consumption or sepsis. This can lead to increased bleeding risk during procedures or while taking anticoagulants.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high serum sodium levels, indicating possible dehydration or inadequate fluid replacement. This can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, and seizures.

4. Sacral Decubitus Sore: The patient has developed a pressure ulcer on the sacrum, likely due to prolonged immobility. Proper wound care and pressure relief measures should be implemented to prevent further deterioration.

5. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, which may be related to the use of pressors or anxiety"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty but remains intubated due to recent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient has also undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is planned but on hold until the patient's respiratory status improves.

24-hour events:
- Started on morphine and ativan for pain management.
- Awaiting pathology results for platelet factor 4 (PF4) titer, which was 0.8. There is uncertainty about whether the patient had heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and argatroban was discontinued.
- PEG gastrograffin study showed that contrast emptied into the stomach, allowing for total parenteral nutrition (TF) to be resumed.
- Patient's pressor requirement increased to 0.3, and the patient is still net +700ml positive. Lasix infusion was stopped.
- Met with the family who are considering comfort care due to the prolonged course and concerns about the risks associated with cardiac surgery.
- The patient is very tachypneic with pressure support (PS) trial this morning, and arterial blood gas (ABG) with low pO2 of 56. FiO2 was increased to 50.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress  with plan for
   trach/PEG today and awaiting AVR.
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area (.4
.9cm2). Appears to be perfusing well at this time.
   - f/up CT surgery regarding possible date for AVR; awaiting heme recs.
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O -1L, CVP 10-12
   # Hypotension:
   Likely related to critical AS, no evidence of active infection
   currently. [**Month (only) 8**] be a contribution from sedatives.
   - Diuresis as above
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   - check AM cortisol
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p trach/PEG yesterday
   - continue to wean while on trach
   - diuresis as above with goal 1L out
   - PSV trial
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts stable. Repeat PF4 positive but titer and serotonin release assay
   are pending.
   - heme following
   - continue argatroban
   - f/u resent PF4 titer, serotonin release assay
   - holding heparin
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:
   Likely related to pressors, also consider anxiety and pain contribution
   - HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   Levophed and volume related
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   - ativan prn, morphine prn

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes a recent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), as well as a planned aortic valve replacement (AVR). 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial tachycardia, sacral decubitus sore, and hypernatremia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. It is important to monitor the patient closely and adjust diuretic therapy and vasopressor support as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or if the tracheostomy becomes obstructed. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and daily assessment for VAP is necessary. 

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications. Monitoring of platelet count and coagulation parameters is necessary, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent bleeding events.

4. Atrial tachycardia: The patient's atr"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with critical aortic stenosis now s/p valvuloplasty and still
   intubated with VAP, hypoxia and respiratory distress  with plan for
   trach/PEG today and awaiting AVR.
   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area (.4
.9cm2). Appears to be perfusing well at this time.
   - f/up CT surgery regarding possible date for AVR; awaiting heme recs.
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   -continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O -1L, CVP 10-12
   # Hypotension:
   Likely related to critical AS, no evidence of active infection
   currently. [**Month (only) 8**] be a contribution from sedatives.
   - Diuresis as above
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerated
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   - check AM cortisol
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p trach/PEG yesterday
   - continue to wean while on trach
   - diuresis as above with goal 1L out
   - PSV trial
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts stable. Repeat PF4 positive but titer and serotonin release assay
   are pending.
   - heme following
   - continue argatroban
   - f/u resent PF4 titer, serotonin release assay
   - holding heparin
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:
   Likely related to pressors, also consider anxiety and pain contribution
   - HR recently under better control, though tachycardia at times likely
   Levophed and volume related
   - try to wean levophed as possible
   - ativan prn, morphine prn
   .
   # sacral decubitus sore : looking slightly worse per nursing
   - f/up local wound care recs, plastics eval appreciated
   - continue enzymatic debridement
   - call plastics for reeval today
   # Hypernatremia
   - D5W while tube feeds on hold
   - check PM Na

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is currently intubated due to VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today and await an upcoming aortic valve replacement (AVR).

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 77/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg. The patient is receiving norepinephrine at a dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 87 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 36 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 242 mg/dL, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) pH of 7.48. The PT/PTT/INR values are 24.0/56.0/2.3, respectively, and the troponin-T level is 0.02 mg/dL.

   # Critical AS / systolic CHF:  s/p valvuloplasty with good effect on
   valve area (.4
.9cm2). Appears to be perfusing well at this time but
   did have some low BPs overnight requiring increase of pressors and
   lasix stopped.
   - lasix drip goal even to -500cc negative
   - f/up CT surgery recs, plan is on hold for any AVR until respiratory
   status improves
   - limit tachycardia if possible
   # Hypotension: Likely related to critical AS, no evidence of active
   infection currently as still no fevers or leukocytosis now . [**Month (only) 8**] be a
   contribution from sedatives. Overnight he had some low BPs with need to
   increase pressor dose and lasix drip was shut off
   - diuresis goals as above
   - Continue levophed, wean as tolerates
   - Follow urine output, MAPS goal >65
   - repeat central venous O2 and lactate
   - AM cortisol pending today
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p trach placement 2 days ago, tachypneic on
   prior PSV trials
   - reattempt PSV with higher pressures
   - continue diuresis as tolerated as above
   # thrombocytopenias:
   Plts stable in the 80s range now . Repeat PF4 positive (titer .8)  and
   serotonin release assay are pending. Hematology following again and
   felt argatroban was not warranted so it was d/c last night .  No
   definitive HIT diagnosis yet per hematology.
   - heme following, f/up recs
   - holding any argatroban for now
   - f/u serotonin release assay
   - holding heparin / pneumoboots only for PPx
   - follow [**Hospital1 **] CBC/Plts & coags
   .
   #Atrial tachycardia:  Likely related to pressors, also consider anxiety
   and pain contribution. Once levophed increased seems patient was more
   tachycardic, in ST and not afib now.
   - wean pressor as tolerates
   - ativan prn, morphine prn for agitation component
   -telemetry
   -holding off on any BB in setting of pressors

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is still intubated. He has recent VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient recently had tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is planned once the patient's respiratory status improves.

The patient started on morphine and lorazepam for pain management. There is uncertainty about whether the patient had heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), but argatroban was discontinued. A gastrograffin study showed that contrast emptied into the stomach, allowing for tube feeding (TF) to be resumed.

The patient's pressor requirement increased, and the patient remains net positive with a lasix infusion stopped at 5 pm. The family is considering comfort care due to the prolonged course and high risk of surgery. The plan is to reassess the patient's trajectory in the next 48 hours and address goals on Friday.

The patient is tachypneic during pressure support trials and has a low pO2 of 56, so the FiO2 was increased to 50. The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, and platelet levels are stable in the 80s range. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis who underwent valvuloplasty and is still intubated. He has recently developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient has also undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) is pending until the patient's respiratory status improves.

The patient's pressor requirement has increased, and he is experiencing hypotension. His respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube and controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist and autoflow. The patient's oxygen saturation is 91%, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 53, PaO2 of 140, and HCO3- of 36.

Physical examination reveals a loud 4/6 systolic murmur over the left upper sternal border, mild rhonchi over the right and left lung apices, and crackles over the left lateral base. The patient has pale skin, scattered ecchymoses over the knees bilaterally, and a small bruised area around the tracheostomy tube.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL, elevated troponin-T at 20, and elevated lactate levels at 1.9 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Critical AS/systolic CHF: The patient underwent valvuloplasty with good effect on valve area. He appears to be perfusing well at this time.
- Follow-up with cardiac surgery regarding possible date for AVR; awaiting hematology recommendations.
- Limit tachycardia if possible.
- Continue current Lasix drip with goal I/O -1L, CVP 10-12.

2. Hypotension:
- Diuresis as above.
- Continue levophed, wean as tolerated.
- Follow urine output, mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal >65.
- Repeat central venous O2 and lactate.
- Check AM cortisol.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient recently underwent tracheostomy and PEG.
- Continue to wean while on tracheostomy.
- Diuresis as above with goal 1L out.
- Pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial.

4. Thrombocytopenia:
- Platelets stable. Repeat PF4 positive but titer and serotonin release assay are pending.
- Hematology following.
- Continue argatroban.

   with pneumonia, now with prolonged hospital stay c/b septic and
   cardiogenic shock. Now s/p valvuloplasty with improved diuresis and s/p
   trach/Peg. Current active issues include persistent respiratory failure
   and worsening HoTN.
   #. HoTN: Initially mixed cardiogenic and septic picture, currently most
   likely cardiogenic.
   - Will diurese and aim for CVP 10-12, titrate lasix gtt.
   - Wean levophed as tolerated.
   - AM cortisol
   #. Respiratory failure: Likely related to volume overload but has
   underlying recovering pneumonia as well as possible history of
   pulmonary fibrosis. S/p trach.
   - Cont diuresis for now.
   - Off sedation. Transition to PSV. Attempt to wean vent/SBT as
   tolerated.
   - Completed course of antibiotics.
   #. Critical AS: S/p valvuloplasty [**4-21**]. No immediate plan for AVR. CT
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] has signed off until after patient off vent.
   #. Thrombocytopenia: HIT +. [**Month (only) 8**] be medication related as well.
   - Awaiting further studies. Heme following. Continue argatroban for
   now.
   #. Atrial tachycardia: Increased in setting of aggressive diuresis and
   being off sedation.
   - No BB given pressor requirement.
   - Holding amiodarone given possible underlying lung disease.
   - PRN pain control and ativan for anxiety/benzo withdrawal.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, pulmonary fibrosis who initially presented with pneumonia and now has a prolonged hospital stay due to septic and cardiogenic shock. The patient has undergone valvuloplasty with improved diuresis and tracheostomy/PEG placement. 

The patient currently faces several active issues, including persistent respiratory failure and worsening hypotension (HoTN). The HoTN initially had a mixed cardiogenic and septic origin but is now most likely cardiogenic in nature. The plan includes diuresis to aim for a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10-12, titrating lasix gtt, weaning levophed as tolerated, and conducting AM cortisol. 

For the respiratory failure, continuing diuresis is planned, along with transitioning to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and attempting to wean off the ventilator/spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) as tolerated. The antibiotics have been completed. 

Regarding critical aortic stenosis, the patient has undergone valvuloplasty but no immediate plan for aortic valve replacement (AVR) has been made. The CT doctor will sign off after the patient is off the ventilator. 

Thrombocytopenia is present, and the patient has been diagnosed with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT +). Medications related to this condition are being considered. 

An atrial tachycardia has increased in the setting of aggressive diuresis and being off sedation. No beta-blocker has been given due to pressor requirements. Amiodarone is being withheld due to possible underlying lung disease. 

Hypernatremia is also noted, and the plan is to change to free water flush when the PEG tube can be used. 

The patient's code status is full code, although the family is aware of the poor prognosis. Ongoing discussions regarding this matter are being held. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) through the PEG tube, and regular insulin sliding scale is being used for glycemic control. The patient has arterial and multi-lumen lines in place, as well as a Cordis/introducer line. Prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention with boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, daily wake-up, and respiratory system compliance monitoring (RSBI). 

Overall, the patient remains critically ill."

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, pulmonary fibrosis, who initially presented with pneumonia and is now experiencing prolonged hospital stay due to septic and cardiogenic shock. He has undergone valvuloplasty and tracheostomy placement. The patient's current active issues include persistent respiratory failure and worsening hypertensive oliguria (HoTN).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. HoTN (hypertensive oliguria): This condition is likely cardiogenic with contributing factors from sedation. The patient's blood pressures are being weaned off pressors and lasix gtt has been restarted for the goal of treating blood volume below 500 mL.

2. Respiratory failure: This may be related to volume overload, underlying recovering pneumonia, and possible history of pulmonary fibrosis. Diuresis is being continued, and the patient is transitioning from mechanical ventilation to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The plan is to wean off the vent and perform spontaneous breathing trials as tolerated.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has been diagnosed with HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). Further studies are awaiting, and heme follow-up has asked to discontinue argatroban.

4. Critical aortic stenosis: The patient underwent valvuloplasty on [**4-21**]. No immediate plan for aortic valve replacement (AVR) is"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo M with history of AS, pulmonary fibrosis who initially presented
   with pneumonia, now with prolonged hospital stay c/b septic and
   cardiogenic shock. Now s/p valvuloplasty with improved diuresis and s/p
   trach/Peg. Current active issues include persistent respiratory failure
   and worsening HoTN.
   #. HoTN: Initially mixed cardiogenic and septic picture, currently most
   likely cardiogenic with contributing factor from sedation.
   - Off lasix gtt for worsening HoTN with improvement in BPs. Now weaning
   pressors and restarting lasix gtt for goal TBB -500.
   - Wean  pressors consider changing to neo..
   - AM cortisol pending
   #. Respiratory failure: Likely related to volume overload but has
   underlying recovering pneumonia as well as possible history of
   pulmonary fibrosis. S/p trach.
   - Cont diuresis for now given increased O2requirement overnight.
   - Off sedation gtt. Transition to PSV. Attempt to wean vent/SBT as
   tolerated.
   - Completed course of antibiotics.
   #. Critical AS: S/p valvuloplasty [**4-21**]. No immediate plan for AVR. CT
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] has signed off until after patient off vent and stronger.
   #. Thrombocytopenia: HIT +. [**Month (only) 8**] be medication related as well.
   - Awaiting further studies. Heme following and asked us to d/c
   argatroban.
   #. Atrial tachycardia:
   - No BB given pressor requirement.
   - Holding amiodarone given possible underlying lung disease.
   - PRN pain control and ativan for anxiety/benzo withdrawal.
   #. GOC: Full code, but family aware of poor prognosis. Ongoing
   discussions with plans to make CMO tomorrow if no improvement.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, pulmonary fibrosis, and previous pneumonia. He initially presented with pneumonia and later developed septic and cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent valvuloplasty and tracheostomy placement. Currently, the patient is experiencing persistent respiratory failure and worsening hypotension (HoTN).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. HoTN: The patient's hypotension may be cardiogenic in nature, potentially due to underlying heart failure. Contributing factors could include sedation and volume overload. The plan is to wean off pressors and restart lasix gtt for goal TBB -500.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be related to volume overload, underlying recovering pneumonia, and possible history of pulmonary fibrosis. The plan is to continue diuresis, transition from sedation gtt to pressure support ventilation (PSV), attempt to wean vent/SBT as tolerated, and complete the course of antibiotics.

3. Critical AS: The patient had a valvuloplasty for critical aortic stenosis but does not have an immediate plan for aortic valve replacement (AVR). The cardiologist has signed off until after the patient is off the ventilator and stronger.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a positive heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (H"
