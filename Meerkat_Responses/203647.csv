","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and diabetes mellitus. He presented to the ICU with new onset of motor aphasia. Neurological imaging revealed minimal changes, indicating a good prognostic factor for recovery from an embolic stroke. 

The patient underwent stenting of the left carotid artery due to a 95% lesion. Blood pressure goals have been set at 140-180 mmHg, and he is currently on neoephrine and nitroprusside as needed. Neuro exams are being monitored every 2 hours. 

There is no evidence of active ischemia related to coronary artery disease, and the patient is continuing on aspirin, statin, zetia, and plavix. Beta-blockers have been held, and it is planned to restart them in 3 days. 

The patient also has sinus bradycardia, which may be a result of carotid stimulation. Ionotropes will be used if necessary. 

Other medical issues include diabetes mellitus, for which oral hypoglycemics have been held, and the patient is now NPO (nothing by mouth). He will be started on a heart-healthy, diabetic diet. 

Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is being given with subcutaneous heparin. Pain management and bowel regimen are as needed. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/90 mmHg to 150/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals alertness and orientation, normal cardiac examination, clear lung sounds without wheezes or crackles, soft abdomen without tenderness, and equal pulses in both extremities. Neurological examination shows persistent anomia, somewhat improved from the previous day, with intact cranial nerves, normal motor strength, sensation, coordination, and reflexes. 

Laboratory results indicate normal electrolyte levels, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and total bilirubin levels. Coagulation studies show normal prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR). 

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including acetaminophen, lorazepam, aspirin, atropine, clopidogrel, ezetimibe, simvastatin, heparin, and morphine sulfate. 

Overall, the patient's medical complications and conditions include hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, recent carotid artery stenting, presumed embolic stroke, and sinus bradycardia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and recent left carotid artery stenting. He presented with new-onset motor aphasia and has been diagnosed with a likely embolic stroke from the left carotid artery. The MRI/MRA imaging shows minimal change, indicating a good prognostic factor for recovery.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 133/90 mmHg, heart rate of 56 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. He is receiving phenylephrine infusion to maintain blood pressure between 140-160 mmHg. His neurological examination reveals motor aphasia, with intact cranial nerves and normal muscle strength, sensation, and coordination. His reflexes are 0-1+ bilaterally, and toes downgoing.

The patient has several medical conditions, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes. He is currently on various medications such as aspirin, statins, metformin, glyburide, clopidogrel, ezetimibe, simvastatin, and heparin.

Plan:
The patient's plan includes maintaining blood pressure between 140-180 mmHg, serial neuro exams, and appreciation of neuro recommendations. He will continue on ASA, statin, zetia, and plavix. The pump medication, Novas,"

   55 M with HTN, CAD s/p RCA stent, now s/p stenting of left carotid
   artery.
   NEUROLOGIC DEFICIT - Word finding difficulty developed after procedure,
   resolved in less than 24hrs.
   - DDx embolic stroke from left carotid artery vs migraine per neuro.
   MRI/MRA imaging shows minimal change which is good prognostic factor
   for recovery. Also speech center with good collaterals.
   - F/U final MRI/MRA read not available.
   - Maintain SBP 130-180
   - Serial neuro exams
   STATUS-POST LEFT CAROTID ARTERY STENT - Left 95% lesion stented
   - Blood pressure goal 140-180, using IVF to get off Neo (holding home
   Norvasc and atenolol)

   CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE - no evidence of active ischemia
   - Continue on ASA, Statin, zetia, plavix
   - Hold beta-[**Last Name (LF) 867**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] restart once BP higher.
   RHYTHM:  Sinus bradycardia (likely from carotid stimulation) resolved.
   AUTODIURESIS: Etiology likely vagal response. Will need replacement IVF
   to keep up with BP.
   - Hopefully will break vagal cycle with catecholamine release of
   ambulation.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, who underwent stenting of the left carotid artery. The patient experienced transient neurological changes post-procedure, which were initially thought to be secondary to a migraine but have now completely resolved. The patient's blood pressure remains low (goal >130), and they have been ambulated with IV fluids given to increase blood pressure. However, the patient is urinating a lot. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/75 to 155/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has normal cardiac examination findings. Lung examination reveals clear to auscultate bilaterally, and the abdomen is soft with no tenderness or masses. The patient has weak peripheral pulses but no edema, and distal pulses are intact. Neurological examination shows intact cranial nerves II and XII, with no word finding difficulties, pronator drift, or other deficits. 

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 14.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 14.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 42.2%, platelet count of 187 K/uL, blood glucose of 187 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, and sodium of 141 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,106 mL and total output of 4,450 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,344 mL. 

The patient's plan includes maintaining systolic blood pressure between 130-180, serial neuro exams, and holding certain medications such as beta blockers until blood pressure improves. The patient is on aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, ezetimibe, insulin, and phenylephrine infusions. The patient's contact information is provided."
