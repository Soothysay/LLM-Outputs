","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), who underwent alcohol ablation for ethanol, atrial fibrillation on dofetilide, and received a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ICD shock. The patient's VT was likely secondary to prolonged QT interval caused by multiple QT-prolonging medications (dofetilide and levaquin) and hypokalemia. The patient received 4g magnesium and the ICD functioned appropriately. 

The patient has clean coronary arteries on catheterization 6 months ago, with no history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Dofetilide is being held for now, and an endocrine consultation is requested regarding the possible initiation of amiodarone. The ICD is to be reprogrammed for a faster heart rate (85 beats per minute). Continuous beta-blocker therapy is recommended. Warfarin is being held due to an INR of 3.1, and will be restarted tomorrow. Potassium and magnesium levels need to be repleted to > 4.5 and > 2.5 respectively. Spironolactone is considered as well. The patient is being monitored on telemetry.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), who underwent alcohol ablation for ethanol septal ablation. She also has atrial fibrillation and is on dofetilide. The patient previously received a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) that required an ICD shock.

Assessment and Plan:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), post ethanol ablation, atrial fibrillation on dofetilide, and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) that required an ICD shock. The patient's VT is likely secondary to medications (dofetilide vs levaquin) or hypokalemia. The EKG shows a ventricular paced rhythm with QTc prolongation to approximately 500.

The patient has acute on chronic diastolic heart failure with evidence of volume overload, as indicated by bibasilar crackles on examination. She received 20mg IV lasix this morning for SOB and bibasilar crackles. No EKG changes were noted. The etiology of her pulmonary edema is unclear, but it could be related to her HOCM.

There is no history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and her coronary catheterization six months ago revealed clean coronaries.

The patient's blood pressure is currently 100/50, and her cardiac medications include metoprolol 37.5mg TID, lipitor, and tricor. She is also on warfarin and has a code status of full code.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), atrial fibrillation (AF), and previous ethanol ablation. She is on dofetilide for AF and has a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ICD shock. She was given intravenous magnesium, and her ICD interrogation showed appropriate function. The VT is likely due to medications (dofetilide or levoquin) or hypokalemia. There is no evidence of ischemia as her coronary arteries are clean from a catheterization 6 months ago, and she has no history of coronary artery disease (CAD).

The patient's acute SOB is attributed to acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. She has a history of moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with preserved ejection fraction (>70%). Evidence of volume overload is noted on the physical examination. The patient received 20mg intravenous lasix for SOB and bibasilar crackles. No EKG changes were observed, and the etiology of the pulmonary edema is unclear. It could be related to her HOCM.

Other assessments and plans include:

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), alcohol ablation, atrial fibrillation on dofetilide, and biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) that required ICD shock. The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure and evidence of volume overload. She also has a history of hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's recent episode of polymorphic VT indicates an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Close monitoring and adjustment of antiarrhythmic medications may be necessary.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's acute on chronic diastolic heart failure and bibasilar crackles suggest an exacerbation of her heart failure. Monitoring fluid status, optimizing cardiac support, and adjusting diuretic therapy may be required.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels need to be addressed, as hypokalemia can contribute to arrhythmias. Repletion of potassium is recommended.
4. Medication interactions: The patient's use of dofetilide and levaquin may have contributed to the polymorphic VT episode. Holding dofetilide and closely monitoring for any further episodes of VT is advised"

   TTE ([**12-30**]): The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The diameters of
   aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2097-3-4**], a resting LVOT gradient is no longer detected.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old F withHOCM s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV
   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.
   - hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute renal failure
   - decrease BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF if continues to be hypotensive this PM, cr does
   not improve and if lung exam shows no crackles
   - monitor respiratory sx
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 24 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.  A
   sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's
   polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT in the setting of
   getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in
   ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries on cath 6 months
   ago, and no history of CAD.  Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but
   was held last night due to acute renal failure.
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - continue to Hold Warfarin today for INR 3.4
   - Replete K > 4.5, Mg > 2.5
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and was started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV
   Lasix to which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg
   x 1.  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s when
   sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**].  Unfortunately, in the setting of relative hypotension and
   receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg + 80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off
   to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were low, Cr bumped to 2.2, urine lytes
   showed Feurea of 13.
   - hold off on lasix for now
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - hold valsartan and spironolactone given acute renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - get pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF (250cc bolus)
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal fnx
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD.  Cath [**6-12**] reveals clean coronaries.
   .
   # HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION:  Currently hypotensive in the 70s-80s with
   acute renal failure.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] and lasix for now.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) who presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). She has undergone ethanol ablation for HOCM, atrial fibrillation on dofetilide, and has a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

The patient's current condition includes acute diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 70-80% as shown on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). She also has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL and urine output nearly zero. Her blood pressures are in the 70s-80s, and she is hypotensive.

The patient's medication regimen includes several cardiac medications such as dofetilide, metoprolol, dronedarone, valsartan, spironolactone, lasix, and others. However, due to her acute renal failure, some medications have been held, including lasix, valsartan, and spironolactone.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine level indicate acute renal failure. It is important to monitor her renal function and"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old F withHOCM s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV
   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.
   - hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute renal failure
   - decrease BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF if continues to be hypotensive this PM, cr does
   not improve and if lung exam shows no crackles
   - monitor respiratory sx
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 24 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.  A
   sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's
   polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT in the setting of
   getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in
   ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries on cath 6 months
   ago, and no history of CAD.  Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but
   was held last night due to acute renal failure.
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - continue to Hold Warfarin today for INR 3.4
   - Replete K > 4.5, Mg > 2.5
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**],
   and was started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV
   Lasix to which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg
   x 1.  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s when
   sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**].  Unfortunately, in the setting of relative hypotension and
   receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg + 80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off
   to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were low, Cr bumped to 2.2, urine lytes
   showed Feurea of 13.
   - hold off on lasix for now
   - hold dronedarone today, will restart tomorrow
   - hold valsartan and spironolactone given acute renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - get pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF (250cc bolus)
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal fnx
   .
   # CORONARIES: No history of CAD.  Cath [**6-12**] reveals clean coronaries.
   .
   # HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION:  Currently hypotensive in the 70s-80s with
   acute renal failure.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] and lasix for now.
   - decrease BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), previous alcohol ablation, atrial fibrillation on dofetilide, and biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and a episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ICD shock.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. Her transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on [**12-30**] showed diastolic dysfunction and an ejection fraction (EF) of 70-80%. She was given two doses of intravenous (IV) lasix yesterday due to her lungs sounding wet, but did not produce much urine. Currently, lasix is on hold since the patient has developed acute renal failure.

The patient's rhythm is stable without further VT episodes for over 24 hours. Her ICD was reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase the rate from 70 to 80 beats per minute (bpm), and the initial detection for ventricular fibrillation (VF) was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.

   TTE ([**12-30**]): The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The diameters of
   aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
   valve is not well seen. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2097-3-4**], a resting LVOT gradient is no longer detected.
   Assessment and Plan
   81 year old F withHOCM s/p EtOH ablation, AF on dofetilide, s/p BiV
   ICD, presenting with acute onset SOB and episode of polymorphic VT
   requiring ICD shock.
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.
   - hold lasix and valsartan given acute renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF
   - monitor respiratory sx
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 24 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.  A
   sense V paced rhythm, with QTc prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's
   polymorphic VT likely secondary to prolonged QT in the setting of
   getting multiple QT-prolonging medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in
   ED) and being hypokalemic (K 3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely
   related to ischemia as patient has clean coronaries on cath 6 months
   ago, and no history of CAD.  Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but
   was held last night due to acute renal failure.
   - continue dronedarone, which was restarted on [**12-30**]

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), alcohol ablation, atrial fibrillation on dofetilide, and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).
- She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) that required an ICD shock.
- Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) on December 30th showed diastolic dysfunction and an ejection fraction (EF) of 70-80%.
- The patient was given two doses of intravenous furosemide (Lasix) yesterday due to sounds of fluid overload, but did not produce much urine.
- Currently, Lasix is on hold since the patient developed acute renal failure.
- Blood pressure has been fluctuating, ranging from 83/49 mmHg to 129/72 mmHg.
- Heart rate is stable within the range of 71-92 beats per minute.
- Respiratory rate is normal at 15-22 inspirations per minute.
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 95% through nasal cannula oxygen delivery.
- The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.2°C (98.9°F).
- Physical examination reveals no abnormal findings, except for a systolic flow murmur at the right upper sternal border.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating renal impairment.
- Electrolytes show low potassium (K+) levels.
- The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is slightly elevated.
- Other lab values, including hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), and liver function tests (PT/PTT/INR), are within normal range.
- The patient's TTE results indicate diastolic dysfunction, moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, and no evidence of ischemia.
- The patient's rhythm has been stable without further VT episodes since reprogramming of the ICD.
- The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to hypokalemia and the use of multiple QT-prolonging medications.
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, leading to the decision to hold Lasix and valsartan.
- The patient's electrolytes need to be monitored, and gentle intravenous fluid replacement is considered.
- The patient's respiratory symptoms should be closely monitored.
- The patient's medication regimen needs to be adjusted, including holding spironolactone, continuing dronedarone, and repleting potassium and magnesium levels.
- The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring on telemetry.
- The patient's coronary arteries are clean"

   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**] and
   started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV Lasix to
   which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg x 1 on
   [**12-30**].  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s
   when sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**], and continued to be held on [**12-31**].  Unfortunately, in the setting
   of relative hypotension and receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg +
   80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were
   low, Cr bumped to 2.2 on [**12-31**], urine lytes showed Feurea of 13. Repeat
   urine lytes on [**12-31**] showedFeNa 0.23.  Patient was given 500cc bolus
   yesterday for creatinine of 2.6 and hypotension to 50s.
   - continue to hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute
   renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - consider gental IVF (250cc bolus)
   - get pm lytes
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal fnx
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.  Patient was
   hypotensive down to systolic 50s despite holding lasix, spironolactone
   and valsartan on [**12-31**].  Patient was mentating well, but does have end
   organ damage evidenced by actue renal failure.
   - continue to hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute
   renal failure
   - continue BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF if continues to be hypotensive this PM, cr does
   not improve and if lung exam shows no crackles
   - monitor respiratory sx
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 48 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.
   Patient with A sense V paced rhythm, she presented initially with QTc
   prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's polymorphic VT likely secondary
   to prolonged QT in the setting of getting multiple QT-prolonging
   medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in ED) and being hypokalemic (K
   3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely related to ischemia as patient has
   clean coronaries on cath 6 months ago, and no history of CAD.
   Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but was held last night due to
   acute renal failure.
   - start flecanide today

   # HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION:  Currently hypotensive in the 70s-80s with

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), who underwent ethanol ablation for ventricular tachycardia (VT), and has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) on dofetilide, and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and an episode of polymorphic VT requiring ICD shock.

The patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg on Hospital1 7, and started on Spironolactone on 12-30. However, due to acute renal failure, all antihypertensives were held at midnight on 12-30, and continued to be held on 12-31. Unfortunately, despite receiving two doses of IV lasix (40mg + 80mg), the patient's urine output dropped off to nearly zero around 3 AM when blood pressures were low. Creatinine bumped up to 2.2 on 12-31, and urine electrolytes showed a Feurea of 13. Repeat urine electrolytes on 12-31 showed FeNa 0.23.

   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Patient was restarted on Valsartan 40mg [**Hospital1 7**] and
   started on Spirinolactone on [**12-30**].  Patient was given 40mg IV Lasix to
   which patient did not put out much, so was given IV lasix 80mg x 1 on
   [**12-30**].  Patient
s pressures were in 90-100's when awake, down to 70s
   when sleeping, so valsartan and spironolactone were held at midnight on
   [**12-30**], and continued to be held on [**12-31**].  Unfortunately, in the setting
   of relative hypotension and receiving 2 doses of IV lasix (40mg +
   80mg), patient
s UOP dropped off to nearly zero ~3AM when bp's were
   low, Cr bumped to 2.2 on [**12-31**], urine lytes showed Feurea of 13. Repeat
   urine lytes on [**12-31**] showedFeNa 0.23.  Patient was given 500cc bolus
   yesterday for creatinine of 2.6 and hypotension to 50s.
   - continue to hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute
   renal failure
   - encourage PO intake
   - consider gental IVF (250cc bolus)
   - get pm lytes
   - avoid renal toxins and renally dose meds
   - continue to trend renal fnx
   .
   # PUMP/SOB:  Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  TTE on [**12-30**]
   showed diastolic dysfunction and EF 70-80%. Patient was given 2 doses
   of IV lasix yesterday (40mg and 80mg) because she sounded wet, and did
   not put out much urine to the first dose of lasix. Currently lasix is
   on hold since patient has developed acute renal failure.  Patient was
   hypotensive down to systolic 50s despite holding lasix, spironolactone
   and valsartan on [**12-31**].  Patient was mentating well, but does have end
   organ damage evidenced by actue renal failure.
   - continue to hold lasix, spironolactone and valsartan given acute
   renal failure
   - continue BB to metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - encourage PO intake
   - pm lytes
   - consider gental IVF if continues to be hypotensive this PM, cr does
   not improve and if lung exam shows no crackles
   - monitor respiratory sx
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient had no more VT episodes for over 48 hours. ICD was
   reprogrammed on [**12-30**] to increase rate from 70 to 80, and initial
   detection for VF was reprogrammed from 30/40 beats to 18/24 beats.
   Patient with A sense V paced rhythm, she presented initially with QTc
   prolongation to approx 500.  Patient's polymorphic VT likely secondary
   to prolonged QT in the setting of getting multiple QT-prolonging
   medications (doefetilide vs levaquin in ED) and being hypokalemic (K
   3.3).  The VT episodes were unlikely related to ischemia as patient has
   clean coronaries on cath 6 months ago, and no history of CAD.
   Spironolactone was started on [**12-30**], but was held last night due to
   acute renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), alcohol ablation, atrial fibrillation on dofetilide, and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presented with acute onset shortness of breath (SOB) and a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) episode requiring an ICD shock. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure and is currently on diuretics, ACE inhibitor, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Her blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from the 50s to the 100s. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a non-invasive mask, with an SpO2 of 96%. Her physical examination reveals rhonchi throughout the lungs, no crackles, and a JVP of 8cm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's urine output has decreased significantly, and her creatinine levels have increased. She is currently on diuretics, which may worsen renal function. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly is necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently low, ranging from the 50s to the 100s. This may indicate inadequate perfusion to vital organs. Gentle intravenous fluid administration should be considered to maintain adequate blood pressure.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), atrial fibrillation on dofetilide, and biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presented with acute onset shortness of breath and an episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring ICD shock. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure and acute on chronic diastolic heart failure. Her current medications include metoprolol, lasix, spironolactone, and valsartan, which have been temporarily held due to acute renal failure. She also has a history of hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's low urine output, elevated creatinine levels, and high fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) indicate acute renal failure. This could be due to hypotension, medication effects, or diastolic heart failure.
2. Diastolic heart failure: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, wet lung sounds, and diastolic dysfunction on echocardiogram suggest acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings in the 50s and 70s indicate hypotension, which may be contributing to her acute renal failure.
4. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient had an episode of polymorphic VT,"
