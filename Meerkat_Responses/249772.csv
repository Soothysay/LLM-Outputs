   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   downtrending BUN/Cr, etiology of ARF likely pre-renal given EF 10%
   - FeNa 0.13%, then 0.14%, supporting pre-renal etiology
   - Continue to monitor BUN/Cr
   - On IV lasix  I/O goal net negative 1.1.5 L given severe CHF
   - follow lytes
   - s/p Diamox x2 doses for met alkalosis
   - continue aggressive KCL
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing.  Bronchoscopy with BAL done [**8-25**]
   by pulmonary for quantitative cultures. Iinitial cytology shows HSV
   inclusions; HSV cult positive. CHF also likely playing role in resp
   failure given EF 10%.
   - had trach and PEG tube on [**9-5**]
   - lasix drip stoped and metalazone stopped. Got Diamox x 2 doses.
   Switched to Lasix IV 40 TID  with goal I/O of [**2-1**].5 L - Continue
   atrovent nebs prn
   - continue acyclovir for 14 days
   - adjustments to trach tape/straps only to be made by [**Doctor First Name 458**]
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%. Unlikely that
   cardiomyopathy is not partially due to ischemia as OSH states.
   -Continue Digoxin
   -Lopressor
   -pt believed to be fluid overloaded, continue lasix IV
   -Cr stable at 1.2
   -iCaptopril to 25 TID to improve afterload
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Continued fever today , WBC uptrending again., sputum cultures + [**8-18**]
   for pan-sensitive proteus, urine legionella Ag neg, sputum legionella
   cx neg to date, CT/CXR with b/l lower lobe consolidations. RIJ cath tip
   neg. Ucx to date neg. Tib/Fib film no evidence of osteomyelitis. TEE
   w/o evidence of endocarditis. Initial cytology from BAL showing HSV
   inclusions.  Now postive HSV1 viral culture. Renal, RUQ US neg.  CT
   sinus showed air-fluid levels c/w intubation, but cannot r/o infection.
   Source of fever unclear
   - cultures remain neg
   - BAL showed HSV inclusions, postive HSV1 culture
   - Continue Acyclovir 1000mg IV q8 for 14 days total
   - CMV viral load, no DNA detected
   - d/ced cefepime, levofloxacin, flagyl [**8-29**] since recent sputum,
   urine,  cult NG. Completed course for [**8-18**] proteus
   - Monitor daily LFTs given elevated amylase/lipase for concern of
   acalculous cholecystitis in setting of new fever. LFTs slowly
   decreasing, RUQ US negative for acute cholecystitis.
   - HIV consent when patient extubated and consentable
   - ID following.
   - Pt WBC collected today for WBC scan [**9-8**]
   - Plan to CT abd after WBC scan if neg and  if WBC increases and
   continues to be febrile
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   Pt pulled out IJ, is pulling at trach.  Restrained in 2 point.  Haldol
   [**Hospital1 **] and try to decrease fentanyl/midaz. Keep Haldol on for now
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   tachycardia increasing today, presented with AFib with RVR
   - increased beta blocker for rate control  to Metoprolol 37.5 mg
   - If rates become uncontroled in > 140s will increase dig dosage
   tomorrow
   COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platlets are rising.
   - heparin gtt d/c [**3-5**] PEG oozing.
   - replete VIt K at this time since PEG oozing, 2.5mg  VIT K
   PEG
 oozing today, d/c anticoagulation. [**Doctor First Name **] resident to see, follow

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient in the ICU is experiencing multiple medical complications. The key potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's BUN/Cr levels are down-trending, indicating a decline in kidney function. The etiology of acute renal failure is likely pre-renal given an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. FeNa (fractional excretion of sodium) values support a pre-renal etiology. Monitoring BUN/Cr and ensuring adequate fluid balance is crucial.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of factors such as infectious multi-lobar pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and tracheostomy-related issues. Bronchoscopy with BAL was performed, and initial cytology showed HSV inclusions, with a positive HSV culture. Continuing acyclovir treatment for 14 days is recommended.

3. Heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic: The patient has severe cardiomyopathy with an EF of only 10%. This may be partially due to ischemia. Continuing Digoxin, Lopressor, and Lasix IV to manage CHF symptoms is advised.

4. Fever: The patient continues to have a fever despite negative cultures. Initial cytology from BAL showed HSV inclusions, and the patient has tested positive for HSV1. Acyclovir treatment should be continued, and other potential sources of infection should be investigated.

   - Continue to monitor BUN/Cr
   - On IV lasix  I/O goal net negative 1.1.5 L given severe CHF
   - follow lytes
   - s/p Diamox x2 doses for met alkalosis
   - continue aggressive KCL
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing.  Bronchoscopy with BAL done [**8-25**]
   by pulmonary for quantitative cultures. Iinitial cytology shows HSV
   inclusions; HSV cult positive. CHF also likely playing role in resp
   failure given EF 10%.
   - had trach and PEG tube on [**9-5**]

   - adjustments to trach tape/straps only to be made by [**Doctor First Name 458**]
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%. Unlikely that
   cardiomyopathy is not partially due to ischemia as OSH states.
   -Continue Digoxin

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   tachycardia increasing today, presented with AFib with RVR
   - increased beta blocker for rate control  to Metoprolol 37.5 mg
   - If rates become uncontroled in > 140s will increase dig dosage
   tomorrow
   COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platlets are rising.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition can be summarized as follows:

- The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to multi-lobar pneumonia and severe CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of only 10%. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation.
- The patient has developed a fever, and initial cytology from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed herpes simplex virus (HSV) inclusions. A viral culture confirmed HSV1 infection. The source of the fever remains unclear, but it is unclear whether it is related to HSV infection.
- The patient has renal failure, likely pre-renal in nature, as indicated by a decreasing blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr). The patient is receiving intravenous Lasix to promote diuresis and manage fluid balance.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and is being treated with beta-blockers for rate control.
- The patient's coagulopathy may be due to hepatic dysfunction, nutritional deficiency, or the use of certain medications such as levaquin. The patient has been given vitamin K and anticoagulation has been discontinued.
- The patient is experiencing delirium and confusion, possibly related to the severe illness and medications.
- The patient's nutrition is being managed with"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a chief complaint of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient was previously intubated and ventilated due to respiratory failure but has since been extubated. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.8°F (39.3°C), blood pressure ranging from 62-83/48-57 mmHg, heart rate between 88-140 bpm, respiratory rate of 9-44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and receiving medications such as metoprolol, furosemide, and famotidine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's urine output is low at 2,472 mL over 24 hours, and there is a significant fluid balance deficit of -506 mL. The serum creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient is currently on NIPPV, there is still concern for ongoing respiratory distress given the low respiratory rate and the need for supplemental oxygen.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. The source of infection needs to be identified and treated promptly.
4. Delirium/confusion: The patient is exhibiting signs of delirium or confusion, as indicated by the review of"

   negative will hold evening dose
   - s/p Diamox x2 doses for met alkalosis on [**9-7**]
   - continue aggressive KCL
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing.  Bronchoscopy with BAL done [**8-25**]
   by pulmonary for quantitative cultures. Iinitial cytology shows HSV
   inclusions; HSV cult positive. CHF also likely playing role in resp
   failure given EF 10%.
   - had trach and PEG tube on [**9-5**]
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   - continue acyclovir, today is 14/14 in treatment will d/c
   -No sign of pulm edema on recent CXR
   - adjustments to trach tape/straps only to be made by [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   -wean vent senting as tolerated
   -nursing reports increased pulm secretions overnight, sputum cult sent
   -will get ABG today to f/u met alkalosis
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%. Unlikely that
   cardiomyopathy is not partially due to ischemia as OSH states.
   -Continue Digoxin at current dose
   -Lopressor was decreased from 37.5mg QID to 25mg QID  and Captopril for
   increased to 37.5mg TID overnight, however pt hypotensive, therefore
   captopril decreased back to 25mg TID, and lopressor increased back to
   37.5mg QID for rate control of afib. Will aggressively increase BB as
   needed
   -pt euvolemic, decreased lasix IV to 40 [**Hospital1 **] with goal I/O even
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Continued fever today , WBC uptrending again., sputum cultures + [**8-18**]

   sinus showed air-fluid levels c/w intubation, but cannot r/o infection.
   Source of fever unclear
   - cultures remain neg
   - BAL showed HSV inclusions, postive HSV1 culture
   - Continue Acyclovir 1000mg IV q8 for 14 days total
   - CMV viral load, no DNA detected
   - d/ced cefepime, levofloxacin, flagyl [**8-29**] since recent sputum,
   urine,  cult NG. Completed course for [**8-18**] proteus
   - Monitor daily LFTs given elevated amylase/lipase for concern of
   acalculous cholecystitis in setting of new fever. LFTs slowly
   decreasing, RUQ US negative for acute cholecystitis.
   - HIV consent now that pt extubated and consentable
   - ID following.
   - f/u WBC scan results, pt became tachycardic and increased RR while
   lying flat for scan and study was cut short will repeat chest and arm
   portion tomorrow.
   - Plan to CT abd after WBC scan if neg and  if WBC increases and
   continues to be febrile
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   Pt pulled out IJ, is pulling at trach. Now less agitated  Haldol
   switched to zyprexa 5mg TID.
   - EKG for prolonged [**Month/Year (2) **] daily
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   tachycardia increasing today, presented with AFib with RVR
   - increased beta blocker for rate control  to Metoprolol 37.5 mg, will
   aggressively uptitrate to 50mg QID if necessary
   - If rates become uncontroled in > 140s will increase dig dosage
   tomorrow
   -episode of 10 beats of wide complex tachycardia overnight, likely A
   fib with abberancy as upon admission
   -aggressively repleat KCL
   - will contact EP if continues
   -daily [**Name (NI) **] on EKG while on psych meds.
   COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platlets are rising.
   - heparin gtt d/c [**3-5**] PEG oozing.
   - INR  2.9 to 1.6 today after one dose of Vit K, will keep at this
   level since no longer oozing at PEG site with plan of restarting
   coumadin in future for afib

   Critical Care
   Present for the key portions of history and physical as above. Agree
   with assessment and plan as above.  With rising BUN/creat we will hold
   on further diuresis.  Major goal now is to improve CHF status. We are
   attempting rate control with increasing beta blockade and will then
   increase captopril.  Still intermittently requiring vent support
   primarily when he needs to be supine.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, as indicated by the downtrending BUN/Cr levels. This could be due to pre-renal causes or intrinsic renal injury.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely multifactorial in nature. This includes infectious contributions from multi-lobar pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has had a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation.

3. Heart failure (CHF), acute on chronic: The patient has severe cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of only 10%. This indicates a high risk for heart failure exacerbation.

4. Fever: The patient continues to have a fever despite ongoing treatment. Initial cytology from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed herpes simplex virus (HSV) inclusions, and subsequent cultures confirmed HSV1 infection. Other potential sources of infection, such as bacterial pneumonia and urinary tract infection, have been ruled out.

5. Delirium/confusion: The patient previously exhibited agitation and confusion, which has now improved. Antipsychotic medication was adjusted accordingly.

6. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has been diagnosed with AFib with rapid ventricular response. Beta-blockers have been increased for rate control, and digoxin therapy is ongoing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, presenting with acute respiratory failure, renal failure, and heart failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including invasive ventilation, antibiotics, and antiviral medication. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient has shown improvement in some areas, such as a decrease in BUN/Cr ratio, but still requires aggressive treatment and close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, with ongoing hypoxia and difficulty weaning off invasive ventilation. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or further deterioration in lung function.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated BUN and Cr levels. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is crucial to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

3. Heart Failure: The patient's severe cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of only 10% puts him at high risk for exacerbations of heart failure. Aggressive management of fluid balance and careful titration of medications are necessary to optimize cardiac function.

4. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): Despite extensive investigations, the source of the patient's fever remains unclear. Continued surveillance and further diagnostic tests may be required to identify the"

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -etiology of ARF likely pre-renal given EF 10%
   - Continue to monitor BUN/Cr, Cr increased to 1.9 yesterday likely [**3-5**]
   increase in captopril which was subsequently decreased.
   - Yesterday, BUN rising, increased tachycardia and hypotension, appears
   pt becoming euvolemic.
   -yesterday 1.7 L positive, increase lasix to 60IV TID.
   - follow lytes this afternoon
   - s/p Diamox x2 doses for met alkalosis on [**9-7**]
   -Restared free water bolus at 200cc q4h
   - continue aggressive KCL while diuresis with met alkalosis.    If does
   not respond to KCL will restart diamox.  However feel that the slight
   increase in Ph from 7.46 yesterday afternoon likely [**3-5**] increased RR
   and decreased CO2.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing.  Bronchoscopy with BAL done [**8-25**]
   by pulmonary for quantitative cultures. Iinitial cytology shows HSV
   inclusions; HSV cult positive. CHF also likely playing role in resp
   failure given EF 10%.
   - had trach and PEG tube on [**9-5**]
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   - finished acyclovir, yesterday
   -No sign of pulm edema on recent CXR, however GS shows GPC
   - start vanco and precautions for possible MRSA PNA
   - adjustments to trach tape/straps only to be made by [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   -wean vent senting as tolerated, pt required increased vent support
   with the recent increase in secretions
   -nursing reports increased pulm secretions overnight, sputum cult sent
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%. Unlikely that
   cardiomyopathy is not partially due to ischemia as OSH states.
   -Continue Digoxin at current dose
   -Lopressor was decreased from 37.5mg QID to 25mg QID  and Captopril for
   increased to 37.5mg TID overnight, however pt hypotensive, therefore
   captopril decreased back to 25mg TID, and lopressor increased back to
   37.5mg QID for rate control of afib.  Was unable to further increase BB
   [**3-5**] hypotension to SBP 80s.
   -increased lasix IV to 60 TID with goal I/O even
   -will consult heart failure service today to better manage CHF and afib
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Continued fever today , WBC uptrending again., sputum cultures + [**8-18**]
   for pan-sensitive proteus, urine legionella Ag neg, sputum legionella
   cx neg to date, CT/CXR with b/l lower lobe consolidations. RIJ cath tip
   neg. Ucx to date neg. Tib/Fib film no evidence of osteomyelitis. TEE
   w/o evidence of endocarditis. Initial cytology from BAL showing HSV
   inclusions.  Now postive HSV1 viral culture. Renal, RUQ US neg.  CT
   sinus showed air-fluid levels c/w intubation, but cannot r/o infection.
   Source of fever unclear
   - Sputum now shows GPC, f/u cult
   -start vanco for possible MRSA PNA
   - BAL showed HSV inclusions, postive HSV1 culture
   - Finished Acyclovir 1000mg IV q8 for 14 days total
   - CMV viral load, no DNA detected
   - d/ced cefepime, levofloxacin, flagyl [**8-29**] since recent sputum,
   urine,  cult NG. Completed course for [**8-18**] proteus
   - Monitor daily LFTs given elevated amylase/lipase for concern of
   acalculous cholecystitis in setting of new fever. LFTs slowly
   decreasing, RUQ US negative for acute cholecystitis.
   - HIV pending
   - ID following.
   - f/u WBC scan results, pt became tachycardic and increased RR while
   lying flat for scan and study was cut short will repeat chest and arm
   portion today.
   - Plan to CT abd after WBC scan if neg and  if WBC increases and
   continues to be febrile
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   Pt pulled out IJ, is pulling at trach. Now less agitated  Haldol
   switched to zyprexa 5mg TID.
   -pulled at PICC overnight
   - EKG for prolonged [**Month/Year (2) **] daily
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   tachycardia increasing today, presented with AFib with RVR
   - increased beta blocker for rate control  to Metoprolol 37.5 mg, will
   aggressively uptitrate to 50mg QID if necessary
   - If rates become uncontroled in > 140s will increase dig dosage
   tomorrow
   -episode of 10 beats of wide complex tachycardia overnight, likely A
   fib with abberancy as upon admission
   -aggressively repleat KCL
   - will contact EP if continues
   -daily [**Name (NI) **] on EKG while on psych meds.
   -await heart failure input.
   COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platlets are rising.
   - heparin gtt d/c [**3-5**] PEG oozing.
   -          INR  2.9 to 1.4 today after one dose of Vit K, will keep at
   this level since no longer oozing at PEG site with plan of restarting
   coumadin in future for afib
   -can start heparin SQ prophalaxis

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, presenting with acute respiratory failure, renal failure, and heart failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-lobar pneumonia, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level and oliguria. His cardiac ejection fraction (EF) is only 10%, indicating severe systolic dysfunction. The patient also has a fever, and several cultures have been taken to identify the source of infection. Additionally, the patient has delirium and confusion, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is severely compromised due to ARDS, multi-lobar pneumonia, and HSV infection. Continuous monitoring and support with invasive ventilation are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level and oliguria. Aggressive fluid management and careful monitoring of electrolyte balance are crucial to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's severe systolic dysfunction with an EF of 10% puts him at high risk for exacerbations of heart failure"

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -etiology of ARF likely pre-renal given EF 10%
   - Continue to monitor BUN/Cr, Cr increased to 1.9 yesterday likely [**3-5**]
   increase in captopril which was subsequently decreased.
   - Yesterday, BUN rising, increased tachycardia and hypotension, appears
   pt becoming euvolemic.
   -yesterday 1.7 L positive, increase lasix to 60IV TID.
   - follow lytes this afternoon
   - s/p Diamox x2 doses for met alkalosis on [**9-7**]
   -Restared free water bolus at 200cc q4h
   - continue aggressive KCL while diuresis with met alkalosis.    If does
   not respond to KCL will restart diamox.  However feel that the slight
   increase in Ph from 7.46 yesterday afternoon likely [**3-5**] increased RR
   and decreased CO2.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing.  Bronchoscopy with BAL done [**8-25**]
   by pulmonary for quantitative cultures. Iinitial cytology shows HSV
   inclusions; HSV cult positive. CHF also likely playing role in resp
   failure given EF 10%.
   - had trach and PEG tube on [**9-5**]
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   - finished acyclovir, yesterday
   -No sign of pulm edema on recent CXR, however GS shows GPC
   - start vanco and precautions for possible MRSA PNA
   - adjustments to trach tape/straps only to be made by [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   -wean vent senting as tolerated, pt required increased vent support
   with the recent increase in secretions
   -nursing reports increased pulm secretions overnight, sputum cult sent
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%. Unlikely that
   cardiomyopathy is not partially due to ischemia as OSH states.
   -Continue Digoxin at current dose
   -Lopressor was decreased from 37.5mg QID to 25mg QID  and Captopril for
   increased to 37.5mg TID overnight, however pt hypotensive, therefore
   captopril decreased back to 25mg TID, and lopressor increased back to
   37.5mg QID for rate control of afib.  Was unable to further increase BB
   [**3-5**] hypotension to SBP 80s.
   -increased lasix IV to 60 TID with goal I/O even
   -will consult heart failure service today to better manage CHF and afib
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Continued fever today , WBC uptrending again., sputum cultures + [**8-18**]
   for pan-sensitive proteus, urine legionella Ag neg, sputum legionella
   cx neg to date, CT/CXR with b/l lower lobe consolidations. RIJ cath tip
   neg. Ucx to date neg. Tib/Fib film no evidence of osteomyelitis. TEE
   w/o evidence of endocarditis. Initial cytology from BAL showing HSV
   inclusions.  Now postive HSV1 viral culture. Renal, RUQ US neg.  CT
   sinus showed air-fluid levels c/w intubation, but cannot r/o infection.
   Source of fever unclear
   - Sputum now shows GPC, f/u cult
   -start vanco for possible MRSA PNA
   - BAL showed HSV inclusions, postive HSV1 culture
   - Finished Acyclovir 1000mg IV q8 for 14 days total
   - CMV viral load, no DNA detected
   - d/ced cefepime, levofloxacin, flagyl [**8-29**] since recent sputum,
   urine,  cult NG. Completed course for [**8-18**] proteus
   - Monitor daily LFTs given elevated amylase/lipase for concern of
   acalculous cholecystitis in setting of new fever. LFTs slowly
   decreasing, RUQ US negative for acute cholecystitis.
   - HIV pending
   - ID following.
   - f/u WBC scan results, pt became tachycardic and increased RR while
   lying flat for scan and study was cut short will repeat chest and arm
   portion today.
   - Plan to CT abd after WBC scan if neg and  if WBC increases and
   continues to be febrile
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   Pt pulled out IJ, is pulling at trach. Now less agitated  Haldol
   switched to zyprexa 5mg TID.
   -pulled at PICC overnight
   - EKG for prolonged [**Month/Year (2) **] daily
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   tachycardia increasing today, presented with AFib with RVR
   - increased beta blocker for rate control  to Metoprolol 37.5 mg, will
   aggressively uptitrate to 50mg QID if necessary
   - If rates become uncontroled in > 140s will increase dig dosage
   tomorrow
   -episode of 10 beats of wide complex tachycardia overnight, likely A
   fib with abberancy as upon admission
   -aggressively repleat KCL
   - will contact EP if continues
   -daily [**Name (NI) **] on EKG while on psych meds.
   -await heart failure input.
   COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platlets are rising.
   - heparin gtt d/c [**3-5**] PEG oozing.
   -          INR  2.9 to 1.4 today after one dose of Vit K, will keep at
   this level since no longer oozing at PEG site with plan of restarting
   coumadin in future for afib
   -can start heparin SQ prophalaxis

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction (EF) of only 10%. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial in nature. Contributing factors include multi-lobar pneumonia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and possible sepsis.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications. These include hypernatremia (high sodium levels), fever (hypothermia), delirium/confusion, acute renal failure (ARF), acute respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation (AFib), coagulopathy, and potential sources of infection such as HSV and MRSA.

The patient's current treatment plan includes invasive ventilation, antibiotics for possible MRSA pneumonia, antiviral therapy for HSV, and management of CHF. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, and diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance. The patient's heart failure is being managed with digoxin, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. Prophylactic measures such as DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis are also being implemented.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is likely due to a combination of factors including pneumonia, CHF, and sepsis. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   -Currently appears euvolemic if not dry; will hold on lasix
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -Continue to tx pneumonia with vanc; adding flagyl for concern of
   aspiration pna
   - f/u sputum cultures
   -repeat CXR given concern for aspiration
   -Maintain on AC ventilation given tachypnea/agitation
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.6 today.
   Will aggressively give KCL today and begin Diamox; recheck Lytes this
   afternoon and monitor serial ABGs
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -Continue Digoxin at current dose; although pt not tolerating PO in
   setting of ? SBO/blocked G tube thus will give IV Metoprolol until PO
   can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO
   -Appears euvolemic if not dry on exam; thus holding lasix for now
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   -WBC scan unremarkable, HIV negative
   -Continued fever today , sputum cultures grew GPC and now covering with
   vanc but given concern for possible aspiration pna; will add flagyl
   -Urine culture grew Proteus; starting Ceftazidine today
   -obtain new sputum cultures
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt had large bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube o/n however no
   residuals from G tube per nursing; concern for gastroparesis vs SBO vs
   ileus
   -Attempt reglan
   -Consult surgery to determine if PEG functioning properly
   -CT Abdomen per surgery to evaluate for SBO/Ileus
   -NPO for now
   -NGT to gravity; monitior bilious return
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now improving;
   likely as not diuresing as aggressively and thus ? pre-renal and
   intravascularly dry.
   -Hold lasix
   -Goal even for now
   -Renally dose meds
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   -Zyprexa
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   however unable to receive given NPO and PEG tube issues; will use IV
   Lopressor for now
   -Continue dig when able to give PO
   -No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of severe cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute heart failure (CHF), fever, renal failure, delirium/confusion, atrial fibrillation (AF), coagulopathy, and possible gastrointestinal issues.

24-hour events include invasive ventilation, nuclear medicine test, fever, and changes in medication and treatment plans.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including multi-lobar pneumonia and CHF. Treatment includes continuing atrovent nebs as needed, treating pneumonia with vancomycin and adding Flagyl for concern of aspiration pneumonia, repeating chest X-ray due to concern for aspiration, and maintaining on assisted ventilation due to tachypnea and agitation.

2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to large volume diuresis. Treatment includes aggressively giving potassium chloride (KCL) today and beginning diamox, rechecking electrolytes this afternoon and monitoring serial arterial blood gases (ABGs).

3. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure with an EF of only 10%. Treatment includes continuing digoxin at the current dose, holding lasix for now, and restarting carvedilol when the patient can tolerate oral medication.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of severe cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. He is currently on invasive ventilation and has been experiencing fevers. The patient's recent events include the initiation of invasive ventilation, nuclear medicine testing, and the development of a fever. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure likely caused by a combination of factors including multi-lobar pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's tachypnea and agitation suggest the need for assisted ventilation.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to large volume diuresis. The patient's pH is 7.6 today, and aggressive potassium chloride supplementation and diamox will be initiated to address this condition.
3. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient has severe cardiomyopathy with a low ejection fraction. Digoxin therapy will be continued, and metoprolol will be administered until the patient can tolerate oral medication.
4. Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia): The patient continues to have a fever despite coverage with vancomycin. Urine cultures have grown Proteus, and cefazidime therapy will be started. New sputum cultures will be obtained to identify the causative agent"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo male with admission following episode of unresponsiveness and
   with A-Fib with RVR and now hospital course notable for persistent
   ventilatory failure and recurrent fevers.  Of note over past 24 hours
   is evidence of significant aspiration with initiation of tube feeds
   yesterday.  This has been accompanied by evidence of significant SIRS
   with changes in RR and HR and Fever which is concerning for aspiration
   pneumonitis.
   Respiratory Failure
Has trachestomy in place with good function.  He
   has a cycle of central periodic breathing which may well be seen in CHF
   and central chemosensor changes.  He has ongoing Rx for VAP and concern
   for recurrent aspiration is seen.  He has Rx with
   Vanco/Cipro and will use repeat culture or new infiltrate on CXR to
   guide expansion of ABX
   Likely euovolemic
   Will need ABG to evaluate effective ventilation
yesterday was 7.53/41
   suggesting metabolic alkalosis which may be diuresis related..
   Nutrition-Will need tube feeds to restart as possible.  Will need
   medications to be administered.  He is passing gas and stool from
   below.
   -Has very important po medications to be restarted or moved to IV.
   -KUB if not tolerated with contrast.
   -Move to Reglan/Erythro/Narcan as motility needed.
   Sepsis-Fever has moved to qualify as Sepsis at this time.  Source may
   well be pulmonary with recent aspiraiton but his does not explain the
   persistent fevers over previous days.  Will have to Rx. as pneumonia at
   this time.  Was on Vanco/Cipro before today.
   -Continue Vanco/Cipro
   -Will expand based on focal findings
   -Fever source incompletely explained and will have to consider D/C of
   all abx with treatment course completed if no new culture results seen.
   Atrial Fibrillation-
   Lopressor to continue and is needed
   [**Month (only) 60**] need more definitive Rx with Ablation but not in the setting of
   active infection.
   -Rate control will be at issue over long term
   -Anticoagulation to restart given healing from wound sites.
   Congestive Heart Failure-Acute and Chronic with systolic impairment
   -Digoxin
   -Lasix PRN
   -Will need Carvedilol to return.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of unresponsiveness and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for persistent ventilatory failure and recurrent fevers. Over the past 24 hours, there have been significant aspiration events with the initiation of tube feeds yesterday. The patient also exhibits signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with changes in respiratory rate, heart rate, and fever, which is concerning for aspiration pneumonitis.

The patient has a tracheostomy in place with good function. He has ongoing treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and there is concern for recurrent aspiration. The patient is receiving antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, and will use repeat cultures or new infiltrates on chest X-ray to guide the expansion of antibiotic therapy.

There are also indications of congestive heart failure (CHF), both acute and chronic with systolic impairment. The patient's electrolytes show hypernatremia (high sodium), and he is experiencing delirium/confusion. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to persistent ventilatory failure and recurrent fevers. Aspiration pneumonitis is a concern due to the evidence of significant aspiration with tube feeds. The patient's SIRS and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, and the source of infection may be pulmonary with recent aspiration,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   -Currently appears euvolemic if not dry; will hold on lasix
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -Continue to tx pneumonia with vanc; adding flagyl for concern of
   aspiration pna
   - f/u sputum cultures
   -repeat CXR given concern for aspiration
   -Maintain on AC ventilation given tachypnea/agitation
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.6 today.
   Will aggressively give KCL today and begin Diamox; recheck Lytes this
   afternoon and monitor serial ABGs
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -Continue Digoxin at current dose; although pt not tolerating PO in
   setting of ? SBO/blocked G tube thus will give IV Metoprolol until PO
   can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO
   -Appears euvolemic if not dry on exam; thus holding lasix for now
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   -WBC scan unremarkable, HIV negative
   -Continued fever today , sputum cultures grew GPC and now covering with
   vanc but given concern for possible aspiration pna; will add flagyl
   -Urine culture grew Proteus; starting Ceftazidine today
   -obtain new sputum cultures
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt had large bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube o/n however no
   residuals from G tube per nursing; concern for gastroparesis vs SBO vs
   ileus
   -Attempt reglan

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, EF of 10%, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple complications and interventions. Key findings include:

1. Unplanned extubation on 9/10/2174, resulting in barotrauma and pneumomediastinum.
2. Fever and positive cultures indicating a possible multi-lobar pneumonia and concern for aspiration pneumonia.
3. Acute heart failure due to severe cardiomyopathy, with an ejection fraction of 10%.
4. Metabolic alkalosis likely caused by large volume diuresis.
5. Delirium/confusion, managed with Zyprexa.
6. Atrial fibrillation, currently uncontrolled and unable to receive oral medications.
7. Acute renal failure, now improving as diuretic therapy has been adjusted.
8. Possible sources of coagulopathy include hepatic dysfunction, nutritional deficiency, and levofloxacin use.
9. The patient's gastrointestinal system is showing signs of ileus or gastroparesis, leading to a decision to hold tube feeds.
10. The patient's condition remains unstable, requiring close monitoring and aggressive management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible aspiration.
2. Acute heart failure exacerbation.
3. Metabolic alkalosis secondary to diuretic use.
4. Delirium/confusion.
5. Atrial fibrillation with associated risk of thromboembolism.
6. Acute renal failure.
7. Coagulopathy with risk of bleeding or thrombosis.
8. Gastrointestinal complications such as ileus or gastroparesis.

Please note that the patient's condition is complex and requires ongoing assessment and management by the ICU team."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   -Currently dry; will hold on lasix
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -Continue to tx pneumonia with vanc; adding flagyl for concern of
   aspiration pna
   - f/u sputum cultures
   -repeat CXR given concern for aspiration
   -Maintain on AC ventilation given tachypnea/agitation
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.6 today.
   Will aggressively give KCL today and begin Diamox; recheck Lytes this
   afternoon and monitor serial ABGs
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -Continue Digoxin at current dose; although pt not tolerating PO in
   setting of ? SBO/blocked G tube thus will give IV Metoprolol until PO
   can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO
   -Appears euvolemic if not dry on exam; thus holding lasix for now
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   -WBC scan unremarkable, HIV negative
   -Continued fever today , sputum cultures grew GPC and now covering with
   vanc but given concern for possible aspiration pna; will add flagyl
   -Urine culture grew Proteus; starting Ceftazidine today
   -obtain new sputum cultures
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt had large bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube o/n however no
   residuals from G tube per nursing; concern for gastroparesis vs SBO vs
   ileus

   -Consult surgery to determine if PEG functioning properly
   -CT Abdomen per surgery to evaluate for SBO/Ileus
   -NPO for now
   -NGT to gravity; monitior bilious return
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now improving;
   likely as not diuresing as aggressively and thus ? pre-renal and
   intravascularly dry.
   -Hold lasix

   -Renally dose meds
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   -Zyprexa
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   -Currently dry; will hold on lasix
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c  vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**].
   - d/c precautions.
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   -Switched back to PS this am, keep on PS as tolerated. If tires go back
   to AC, tolerate higher CO2 given metabolic alk
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.55 today.
   Will aggressively give KCL today and continue Diamox; recheck lytes q6h
   (K, NA, HCO3)
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          presistant met alk despite stopping lasix suggests an
   additional reason.  Likely [**3-5**] GI losses ( hight PEG output)
   -          Will calculated TTKG today
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -Continue Digoxin at current dose; although pt not tolerating PO in
   setting of ? SBO/blocked G tube thus will give IV Metoprolol until PO
   can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO
   -Appears euvolemic if not dry on exam; thus holding lasix for now
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   -WBC scan unremarkable, HIV negative
   -Continued fever today , sputum cultures grew GPC and now covering with
   vanc but given concern for possible aspiration pna; will add flagyl
   -Urine culture grew Proteus; starting Ceftazidine today
   -obtain new sputum cultures
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt had large bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube o/n however no
   residuals from G tube per nursing; concern for gastroparesis vs SBO vs
   ileus
   -Attempt reglan
   -Consult surgery to determine if PEG functioning properly
   -CT Abdomen per surgery to evaluate for SBO/Ileus
   -NPO for now
   -NGT to gravity; monitior bilious return
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now improving;
   likely as not diuresing as aggressively and thus ? pre-renal and
   intravascularly dry.
   -Hold lasix
   -Goal even for now
   -Renally dose meds
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   -Zyprexa
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   however unable to receive given NPO and PEG tube issues; will use IV
   Lopressor for now
   -Continue dig when able to give PO
   -No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. These include respiratory failure, acute heart failure, fever, acute renal failure, delirium/confusion, atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, and ileus. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of factors such as multi-lobar pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient's dryness and decreased ventilation may indicate a non-ARDS-related respiratory failure.

2. Acute Heart Failure: The patient has acute heart failure on top of chronic heart failure, with an ejection fraction of only 10%. The patient's severe cardiomyopathy contributes to this condition. Medications like digoxin, metoprolol, and carvedilol are being used to manage the heart failure.

3. Fever: The patient has persistent fever, which could be attributed to an ongoing infection. Sputum cultures have grown GPC, and the patient is being treated with vancomycin and clindamycin for MSSA. Urine culture has also grown Proteus, and the patient is being started on ceftazidime.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had acute renal failure but is now improving. It is likely pre-renal in nature due to aggressive diuresis and intravascular dryness. Lasix has been held, and medications"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 164 kg male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 10%.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure due to multi-lobar pneumonia and heart failure.
- The patient's fever is likely caused by MSSA and Proteus infections, for which appropriate antibiotics have been started.
- The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to large volume diuresis and gastrointestinal losses.
- The patient's renal function has improved, likely due to pre-renal causes and intravascular volume depletion.
- The patient is experiencing delirium and confusion, for which Zyprexa has been prescribed.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on beta-blockers, but no anti-coagulation has been initiated due to recent oozing from the PEG site.
- The patient has a coagulopathy, possibly due to hepatic and nutritional factors, and is being monitored closely.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumomediastinum: The patient had pneumomediastinum, which may be secondary to recent trauma of the tracheostomy tube.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia due to the presence of a tracheostomy tube and recent ileus.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Moderate pneumomediastinum, which may be secondary to recent trauma
   of the
   tracheostomy tube.
   2. Bilateral lower lobe patchy opacities consistent with aspiration.
   3. Prominent heart.
   4. Bilateral gynecomastia.
   5. Moderate amount of free intraperitoneal air as well as air within
   the
   lesser sac which may be secondary to recent PEG tube placement.
   6. Moderately dilated air-filled loops of both large and small bowel
   which is
   most suggestive of an ileus. No evidence of obstruction. Followup
   evaluation
   with plain films of the abdomen may be helpful. Findings were discussed

   Will aggressively give KCL today and continue Diamox; recheck lytes q6h
   (K, NA, HCO3)
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -Continue Digoxin at current dose; although pt not tolerating PO in
   setting of ? SBO/blocked G tube thus will give IV Metoprolol until PO
   can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO

   -WBC scan unremarkable, HIV negative
   -Continued fever today , sputum cultures grew GPC and now covering with
   vanc but given concern for possible aspiration pna; will add flagyl
   -Urine culture grew Proteus; starting Ceftazidine today
   -obtain new sputum cultures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include respiratory failure due to multi-lobar pneumonia and heart failure on a chronic background. The patient also has acute renal failure, metabolic alkalosis, fever of unknown origin, delirium/confusion, atrial fibrillation, and coagulopathy.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, with both infectious and cardiac contributions. The multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing to the respiratory failure, in addition to the patient's chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of only 10%.

The patient's heart failure is acute on chronic and is associated with severe cardiomyopathy. The patient's poor cardiac output and hypotension suggest a possible hepatic cause for the elevated liver function tests. The patient is currently not tolerating oral intake due to ileus, so they are receiving IV metoprolol and IV digoxin.

The patient has been experiencing a fever, which is of unknown origin. The WBC scan is unremarkable, and the patient is HIV negative. The sputum cultures have grown MSSA, so vancomycin was discontinued and replaced with clindamycin. However, clindamycin sensitivities are not listed yet. The urine culture grew Pseudomonas, so ceftazidime is being continued.

The patient has acute renal failure, which is improving. The likely cause is pre-renal azotemia due to aggressive di"

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo male with cardiomyopathy found with A-fib and RVR complicated by
   respiratory failure and now with recurrent fevers.  He has had a number
   of positive culture results with urine and sputum suggesting bacterial
   growth but has had clinical improvement in the setting of antibiotics
   otherwise despite fevers continuing.  Events of past 24 hours were
   dominated by evidence of imparied gastic emptying and likely
   significant aspiration event by history. Radiographically he has
   minimal evidence of evolution of a new and significiant pulmonary
   infiltrate.  He is currently tolerating PSV quite well with pressures
   [**1-6**] and demonstrates a persistent [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] pattern of ventilation
   this time but overall readiographically and by objective measures lung
   function remains reasonably well preserved despite aspiration event.
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)-
   Maintains free water deficit and will need to replace deficit of approx
   3.5 liters today.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   -Source not identified at this time but with culture results suggesting
   possible pulmonary and urinary growth
   -Ceftaz/Flagyl/Cipro/Bactim
   -Given fever and persistent cultures will have continued antibiotic
   course with finite end point.
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   Respiratory Failure-Patient with combined metabolic and respiratory
   alkalosis and has had persistent metabolic alkalosis
at this point it
   may be in part attributable to gastric losses but we have been unable
   to normalize potassium/Cl with K+=3.1 this morning.
   -Would continue with PSV support
   -[**Last Name (un) 1464**] [**Doctor Last Name 1465**] pattern likely to continue and will be worsened in a
   small way with metabolic alkalosis.
   Metabolic Alkalosis
   -Correct metabolic alkalosis with KCl today
   -Diamox x 48 hours total
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   -LOpressor and move to Carvedilol when po
s tolerated
   -Would suggest diuresis limitation until significant metabolic
   alkalosis has trended to improvement.
   Gastroparesis-
   Reglan
   Not obviously obstructed
   Ileus persists

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with cardiomyopathy who presented with atrial fibrillation and respiratory volume restriction, which has led to respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by recurrent fevers, tracheostomy dislodgment, ileus, and potential aspiration events.

The patient has had multiple positive culture results indicating bacterial growth in the sputum and urine, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired infection. Despite ongoing antibiotic treatment, the patient continues to have fevers. The source of the fever remains unidentified, but it may be related to pulmonary or urinary tract infections.

The patient also exhibits signs of hypernatremia (high sodium levels), which requires maintenance of free water deficit and replacement of approximately 3.5 liters of deficit today. The patient's respiratory failure is associated with metabolic alkalosis, likely due to gastric losses, and delirium/confusion.

The patient's heart failure, both acute on chronic, is managed with beta-blockers and diuretics. Gastroparesis persists, and the patient has an ongoing ileus. Nutritional support is provided through tube feeds, and glycemic control is maintained with regular insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection associated with the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   - On Clinda for MSSA and anerobic coverage, will discuss switching to
   Nafcillin as suspicion for anerobes is low.
   - Received multiple fluid boluses overnight, will monitor pressure and
   use as necessary
   - hold on lasix
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c  vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**].
   - d/c precautions.
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   - Requiring SIMV
   - Periods of apnea, now on SIMV, required sedation to decrease RR, will
   continue to monitor
    # SHOCK
   -          Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotensive overnight with  rising Cr in addition to respiratory
   failure.
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          CVL today to monitor CVP
   -          Arterial line today to monitor BP
   -
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.55 today.
   Will aggressively give KCL today and continue Diamox; recheck lytes q6h
   (K, NA, HCO3)
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          presistant met alk despite stopping lasix suggests an
   additional reason.  Likely [**3-5**] GI losses ( hight PEG output)
   -          Will calculated TTKG today to confirm alk [**3-5**] GI losses
   -          TTKG 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+ (not
   suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal state.
   -          Discuss with Renal   today
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
    - pt not tolerating PO in setting of  ileus,  thus will give IV
   Metoprolol until PO can be resumed
    -Continue Digoxin at current dose once PO intake can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO
   -Appears dry on exam with rising Cr and BUN; thus holding lasix for
   now, giving IVF
   -cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
   -pt HR poorly responding to IV metoprolol and IVF, IV dig attempted,
   with minimal response.  Plan to use IV dilt 5 mg boluses if tachycardic
   to 150s.
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt had large bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube o/n however no
   residuals from G tube per nursing; concern for gastroparesis vs SBO vs
   ileus
    -CT consistent with ileus
   - G-tube to gravity and avoid TF or meds via PEG until residuals are
   (<150cc/8hrs) and non-bilioius as per surgery
   - no residuals overnight
   - Will follow up with surgery reccomendations regarding TF/Meds
   - added lactulose enema to bowel regimen
   -added erythromycin 250mg PO q6h in attempt to resolve ileus- readdress
   after seen by surgery today, d/c if possible
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now stable; likely
   pre-renal and intravascularly dry [**3-5**] intense diuresis. FeNa suggestive
   of pre-renal etiology previously.  Now concerning for increased Cr.
   -Hold lasix
   -Postitive 3 L yesterday given calculated free water deficit yesterday
   of 5.6 L, IVF as needed
   -Giving D5W at 150/hr
   -check pm sodium
   -Renally dose meds
   - discuss possiblility of dialysis (long term) with family today ([**9-10**])
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
    -Zyprexa
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   however unable to receive given NPO and PEG tube issues; will use IV
   Lopressor for now
   -Continue dig when able to give PO
   -No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising.
   -Holding heparin
   -INR up to 2.2,  DDAVP today, will give 1 unit FFP prior to attempting
   CVL

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of severe cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. He has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute on chronic, with multi-lobar pneumonia contributing to his current condition. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to diuresis and potential gastrointestinal losses. He has acute renal failure, pre-renal in nature, and is showing signs of hypernatremia. The patient is also experiencing delirium/confusion, atrial fibrillation, and coagulopathy. He has been on multiple medications including antibiotics for MSSA and Pseudomonas, as well as diuretics, sedatives, and other supportive measures. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 104.4°F, heart rate of 170s, blood pressure ranging from 70s to 156/137 mmHg, respiratory rate in the 40s, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. His electrolytes are imbalanced with high potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows respiratory acidosis with a compensatory metabolic alkalosis. Imaging studies reveal evidence of ileus. The patient's care plan includes aggressive fluid resuscitation"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   -Currently dry; will hold on lasix
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c  vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**].
   - d/c precautions.
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   -Switched back to PS this am, keep on PS as tolerated. If tires go back
   to AC, tolerate higher CO2 given metabolic alk
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.55 today.
   Will aggressively give KCL today and continue Diamox; recheck lytes q6h
   (K, NA, HCO3)
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          presistant met alk despite stopping lasix suggests an
   additional reason.  Likely [**3-5**] GI losses ( hight PEG output)
   -          Will calculated TTKG today to confirm alk [**3-5**] GI losses
   - If TTKG not suggestive of GI loss and unresponsive to KCL and diamox
   will consider work up for hyperadrenal state.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
    - pt not tolerating PO in setting of  ileus,  thus will give IV
   Metoprolol until PO can be resumed
   -Continue Digoxin at current dose once PO intake can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO
   -Appears dry on exam with rising Cr and BUN; thus holding lasix for
   now, giving IVF
   -cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
   -pt HR poorly responding to IV metoprolol and IVF, will give IV dig if
   continuing.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   -WBC scan unremarkable, HIV negative
   - f/u Hep panel
   -Continued fever today , sputum cultures grew MSSA, switched abx from
   vanco and flagyl to clinda and Ceftaz
   -f/u sputum clinda sensitivities
   -Urine culture grew Proteus; starting Ceftazidine today
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt had large bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube o/n however no
   residuals from G tube per nursing; concern for gastroparesis vs SBO vs
   ileus
   -CT consistant with ileus
   - G-tube to gravity and avoid TF or meds via PEG until residuals are
   (<150cc/8hrs) and non-bilioius as per surgery
   - added lactulose enema to bowel regimen
   -added erythromycin 250mg PO q6h in attempt to resolve ileus
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now stable; likely
   pre-renal and intravascularly dry [**3-5**] intense diuresis. FeNa suggestive
   of pre-renal etiology
   -Hold lasix
   -Goal I/O postitive 3 L today given calculated free water deficit of
   5.6 L
   -Giving D5W at 150/hr
   -check pm sodium
   -Renally dose meds
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   -Zyprexa
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   however unable to receive given NPO and PEG tube issues; will use IV
   Lopressor for now
   -Continue dig when able to give PO
   -No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising.
   -Holding heparin
   -INR up to 1.8, if raises to > 2.0 will consider additional dose of
   coumadin
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO,  holding tube feeds

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of severe cardiomyopathy, EF 10%, ileus, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with acute respiratory failure, possibly due to multi-lobar pneumonia and congestive heart failure. The patient has had multiple episodes of fever, and sputum cultures have grown MSSA and Pseudomonas. He is currently on various medications including antibiotics (Clindamycin and Ceftazidime), diuretics (Lasix), digoxin, metoprolol, and heparin. The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure, pre-renal etiology, metabolic alkalosis, atrial fibrillation, and coagulopathy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has multi-lobar pneumonia contributing to respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening pneumonia leading to sepsis.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's severe cardiomyopathy and low EF indicate chronic heart failure. Acute exacerbations can occur due to fluid overload or infections, leading to further deterioration in cardiac function.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely pre-renal in origin. There is a risk of worsening renal function and the need for dialysis.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid complications like hypokalemia and potential cardiac arrhythmias"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   - On Clinda for MSSA and anerobic coverage, will discuss switching to
   Nafcillin as suspicion for anerobes is low.
   - Received multiple fluid boluses overnight, will monitor pressure and
   use as necessary
   - hold on lasix
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c  vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**].
   - d/c precautions.
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   - Requiring SIMV
   - Periods of apnea, now on SIMV, required sedation to decrease RR, will
   continue to monitor
    # SHOCK
   -          Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotensive overnight with  rising Cr in addition to respiratory
   failure.
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          CVL today to monitor CVP
   -          Arterial line today to monitor BP
   -
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.55 today.
   Will aggressively give KCL today and continue Diamox; recheck lytes q6h
   (K, NA, HCO3)
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          presistant met alk despite stopping lasix suggests an
   additional reason.  Likely [**3-5**] GI losses ( hight PEG output)
   -          Will calculated TTKG today to confirm alk [**3-5**] GI losses
   -          TTKG 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+ (not
   suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal state.
   -          Discuss with Renal   today
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
    - pt not tolerating PO in setting of  ileus,  thus will give IV
   Metoprolol until PO can be resumed
    -Continue Digoxin at current dose once PO intake can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO
   -Appears dry on exam with rising Cr and BUN; thus holding lasix for
   now, giving IVF
   -cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
   -pt HR poorly responding to IV metoprolol and IVF, IV dig attempted,
   with minimal response.  Plan to use IV dilt 5 mg boluses if tachycardic
   to 150s.
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt had large bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube o/n however no
   residuals from G tube per nursing; concern for gastroparesis vs SBO vs
   ileus
    -CT consistent with ileus
   - G-tube to gravity and avoid TF or meds via PEG until residuals are
   (<150cc/8hrs) and non-bilioius as per surgery
   - no residuals overnight
   - Will follow up with surgery reccomendations regarding TF/Meds
   - added lactulose enema to bowel regimen
   -added erythromycin 250mg PO q6h in attempt to resolve ileus- readdress
   after seen by surgery today, d/c if possible
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now stable; likely
   pre-renal and intravascularly dry [**3-5**] intense diuresis. FeNa suggestive
   of pre-renal etiology previously.  Now concerning for increased Cr.
   -Hold lasix
   -Postitive 3 L yesterday given calculated free water deficit yesterday
   of 5.6 L, IVF as needed
   -Giving D5W at 150/hr
   -check pm sodium
   -Renally dose meds
   - discuss possiblility of dialysis (long term) with family today ([**9-10**])
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
    -Zyprexa
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   however unable to receive given NPO and PEG tube issues; will use IV
   Lopressor for now
   -Continue dig when able to give PO
   -No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising.
   -Holding heparin
   -INR up to 2.2,  DDAVP today, will give 1 unit FFP prior to attempting
   CVL

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy, presenting with acute respiratory failure, shock, metabolic alkalosis, and acute renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including contributions from multi-lobar pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 10%. Antibiotics have been started for MSSA and pseudomonas infections, and the patient is also on digoxin for heart failure management.

The patient's shock state is indicated by hypotension and rising creatinine levels. Fluid resuscitation has been initiated, and an arterial line has been placed to monitor blood pressure.

The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely due to large volume diuresis, which has resulted in a pH of 7.55. Potassium chloride is being given aggressively to correct the electrolyte imbalance. Additionally, the patient's condition suggests possible gastrointestinal losses, and a calculation of total body potassium (TTKG) has been performed to confirm the cause of alkalosis.

The patient's heart failure is due to severe cardiomyopathy with an EF of only 10%. Medications such as metoprolol and digoxin are being administered to manage heart failure symptoms. However, due to the patient's ileus and inability to tolerate oral intake, these medications are being given intravenously.

The patient's renal failure"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c  vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin yesterday ([**9-12**]). Will renally
   dose nafcillin.
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Requiring SIMV but will try on CPAP and see how he does
 will check
   ABG
 as may have element of restrictive lung disease given body
   habitus. Will also sit him upright to see if this helps his
   ventilation.
   - Periods of apnea, now on SIMV, required sedation to decrease RR, will
   continue to monitor
    # SHOCK
   -          Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotensive overnight with rising Cr in addition to respiratory failure
   and in the setting of CVP of 18.
   - Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not have a
   good gage of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**].
   - Will check mixed venous O2. If <60% will consider cardiac shock more
   likely. >70% sepsis would be more likely.
   - Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          CVL placed [**2174-9-12**].
   -          Arterial line today to monitor BP
   -          Will give 1L fluid bolus and see how BP and UOP respond.
   Would like to avoid pressors if possible. As he is very pre-load
   dependent especially on the vent will try to keep CVP on higher side to
   try to keep up his UOP and BP.
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.45 today.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+ (not
   suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal state.
   -          Discuss with Renal   today
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
    - Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his coreg or
   metoprolol. Will d/c metoprolol order today for ARF and continue with
   coreg when bp able to handle it.
    -Continue Digoxin at current dose once PO intake can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO
   -Appears dry on exam with rising Cr and BUN; thus holding lasix for
   now, giving IVF bolus
   -cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt had high residuals overnight with slight amount of blood. Tube
   feeds were held.
   - Will restart tube feeds when residuals <150ml/8hrs and non-bilioius
   as per surgery. Keep tube to gravity.
    -CT consistent with ileus
   - added lactulose enema to bowel regimen
   -added erythromycin 250mg PO q6h X 3 days last day today.
   - Reglan for motility
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now stable; likely
   pre-renal and intravascularly dry [**3-5**] intense diuresis. FeNa suggestive
   of pre-renal etiology at <1%.  Now concerning for increased Cr.
   -Holding lasix for several days and Cr still rising
   - UOP dropped to <15mL / hour overnight.
   -Will give fluid bolus (1000mL NS) and reassess BP and UOP
   -Renally dose meds
   - will f/u renal consult, Urine eos and casts, and FE urea
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   however unable to receive given NPO, hypotensive and PEG tube issues;
   Will restart Coreg when able.
   -Continue dig when able to give PO
   -No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously and
   coagulopathy
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFTs are no longer elevated but PTT/INR remain
   elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K in tube feeds but near
   normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this effects coumadin
   metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising, fibrinogen high,
   and haptoglobin low.
    - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -Holding heparin
   -Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days first dose today
   ICU Care
    Nutrition: NPO,  Nutren renal with 40g beneprotein @ 45mL/hour. Will
   change back if gets HD to remove protein.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, shock, heart failure (CHF), metabolic alkalosis, acute renal failure (ARF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and coagulopathy.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing difficulty breathing and requires assistance with mechanical ventilation. The cause of respiratory failure is multifactorial, including multi-lobar pneumonia and CHF.

2. Shock: The patient is hypotensive and has positive sputum cultures, indicating a possible infection leading to septic shock. There is also evidence of cardiac shock due to the patient's severe cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%.

3. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with a low ejection fraction. This leads to symptoms such as hypotension and fluid retention.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has a high pH level, which is likely due to intense diuresis causing loss of hydrogen ions.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output, suggesting acute kidney injury. Pre-renal causes are suspected, but the patient's condition is worsening.

6. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing irregular heart rhythms, which may be related to hypovolemia or underlying cardiac issues.

7. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PTT/"

    - pt not tolerating PO in setting of  ileus,  thus will give IV
   Metoprolol until PO can be resumed
    -Continue Digoxin at current dose once PO intake can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO
   -Appears dry on exam with rising Cr and BUN; thus holding lasix for
   now, giving IVF
   -cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
   -pt HR poorly responding to IV metoprolol and IVF, IV dig attempted,
   with minimal response.  Plan to use IV dilt 5 mg boluses if tachycardic
   to 150s.
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt had large bilious return from PEG tube/ET tube o/n however no
   residuals from G tube per nursing; concern for gastroparesis vs SBO vs
   ileus
    -CT consistent with ileus
   - G-tube to gravity and avoid TF or meds via PEG until residuals are
   (<150cc/8hrs) and non-bilioius as per surgery
   - no residuals overnight
   - Will follow up with surgery reccomendations regarding TF/Meds
   - added lactulose enema to bowel regimen
   -added erythromycin 250mg PO q6h in attempt to resolve ileus- readdress
   after seen by surgery today, d/c if possible
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now stable; likely
   pre-renal and intravascularly dry [**3-5**] intense diuresis. FeNa suggestive
   of pre-renal etiology previously.  Now concerning for increased Cr.
   -Hold lasix
   -Postitive 3 L yesterday given calculated free water deficit yesterday
   of 5.6 L, IVF as needed
   -Giving D5W at 150/hr
   -check pm sodium
   -Renally dose meds
   - discuss possiblility of dialysis (long term) with family today ([**9-10**])
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
    -Zyprexa
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   however unable to receive given NPO and PEG tube issues; will use IV
   Lopressor for now
   -Continue dig when able to give PO
   -No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFT are elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K
   in tube feeds but near normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this
   effects coumadin metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising.
   -Holding heparin
   -INR up to 2.2,  DDAVP today, will give 1 unit FFP prior to attempting
   CVL

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 10%. He is currently admitted to the ICU with the following conditions: respiratory failure due to multi-lobar pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF), acute kidney injury (AKI) with possible pre-renal causes, septic shock, and metabolic alkalosis. The patient's family has expressed a desire for him to be DNR but wishes to pursue dialysis and pressors if necessary.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 103.5°F, heart rate of 90 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 97/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator. The patient is intubated through a tracheostomy tube and is receiving SIMV ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 475 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin yesterday ([**9-12**]). Will renally
   dose nafcillin.
   - C.diff negative, will d/c Flagyl per ID
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Tried on trach mask [**9-13**], rapidly became tachypnic to 40s, placed
   back on vent.  Was still hyperventilating on AC (7.41/31/169).  This
   morning will try PSV with PEEP of 8 and
    # SHOCK
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotensive overnight with elevated Cr in addition to respiratory
   failure and CVP 23.
   - Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not have a
   good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**].
   - Mixed venous O2 [**9-13**]. If <60% will consider cardiac shock more
   likely. >70% sepsis would be more likely.- resulted at 68%, so does not
   clarify picture
   - Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          CVL placed [**2174-9-12**].
   -          Arterial line [**9-12**] to monitor BP
   -          CVP 23 on [**9-14**], UOP around 100 mL/hr
   -          Continue Ceftaz
   -          Continue Nafcillin
   -          D/c
d Flagyl as above
   -          Cultures re-sent, will f/u results
   -          Tylenol 650 q6 prn fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -          Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.41 this
   morning.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG previously 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+
   (not suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal
   state.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   - Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his coreg or
   metoprolol. Metoprolol d/c
   -  Continue with coreg
   - Continue Digoxin
   - cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
   - UOP
    -Holding Lasix given increased BUN/Cr
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling.
   - CT consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
   - added lactulose enema to bowel regimen
   - finished erythromycin
   - d/c Reglan
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now stable; likely
   pre-renal and intravascularly dry [**3-5**] intense diuresis. FeNa suggestive
   of pre-renal etiology at <1%.  Now concerning for increased Cr.
   - Cr decreased slightly overnight
   - UOP increased following decreased temp and increased CVPs
   -Holding lasix
   -Will continue to bolus as necessary
   -Renally dose meds
   - Fena 1.5%, no urine eos, 4 hyaline casts
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Continue dig
   - No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously and
   coagulopathy
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFTs are no longer elevated but PTT/INR remain
   elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K in tube feeds but near
   normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this effects coumadin
   metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising, fibrinogen high,
   and haptoglobin low.
   - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -Holding heparin
   - INR 1.9 today down from 2.6 on [**9-13**]
   - Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days first dose today
   ICU Care
   -Nutrition: NPO,  Nutren renal with 40g beneprotein @ 45mL/hour. Will
   change back if gets HD to remove protein.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of severe cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 10%. He presented with respiratory failure, likely due to multi-lobar pneumonia and congestive heart failure. The patient has been febrile, hypotensive, and tachypneic, indicating potential septic shock and cardiac shock. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to large volume diuresis. Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and coagulopathy.

The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, heparin sodium, and renal dosed medications. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and altered electrolyte levels.

The patient's recent imaging studies include a chest X-ray showing resolution of ileus, and a CT scan consistent with ileus. The patient's urine culture grew Pseudomonas, and the sputum culture showed MSSA. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory failure.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics for MSSA and Pseudomonas, discontinuing Flagyl, monitoring CVPs, and aggressively giving potassium chloride. The patient's code status is DNR, and the disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c  vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin yesterday ([**9-12**]). Will renally
   dose nafcillin.
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Requiring SIMV but will try on CPAP and see how he does
 will check
   ABG
 as may have element of restrictive lung disease given body
   habitus. Will also sit him upright to see if this helps his
   ventilation.
   - Periods of apnea, now on SIMV, required sedation to decrease RR, will
   continue to monitor
    # SHOCK
   -          Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotensive overnight with rising Cr in addition to respiratory failure
   and in the setting of CVP of 18.
   - Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not have a
   good gage of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**].
   - Will check mixed venous O2. If <60% will consider cardiac shock more
   likely. >70% sepsis would be more likely.
   - Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          CVL placed [**2174-9-12**].
   -          Arterial line today to monitor BP
   -          Will give 1L fluid bolus and see how BP and UOP respond.
   Would like to avoid pressors if possible. As he is very pre-load
   dependent especially on the vent will try to keep CVP on higher side to
   try to keep up his UOP and BP.
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.45 today.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+ (not
   suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal state.
   -          Discuss with Renal   today
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
    - Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his coreg or
   metoprolol. Will d/c metoprolol order today for ARF and continue with
   coreg when bp able to handle it.
    -Continue Digoxin at current dose once PO intake can be resumed
   -Changed from Metoprolol to Carvedilol per Cardiology; will restart
   when tolerating PO
   -Appears dry on exam with rising Cr and BUN; thus holding lasix for
   now, giving IVF bolus
   -cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt had high residuals overnight with slight amount of blood. Tube
   feeds were held.
   - Will restart tube feeds when residuals <150ml/8hrs and non-bilioius
   as per surgery. Keep tube to gravity.
    -CT consistent with ileus
   - added lactulose enema to bowel regimen
   -added erythromycin 250mg PO q6h X 3 days last day today.
   - Reglan for motility
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now stable; likely
   pre-renal and intravascularly dry [**3-5**] intense diuresis. FeNa suggestive
   of pre-renal etiology at <1%.  Now concerning for increased Cr.
   -Holding lasix for several days and Cr still rising
   - UOP dropped to <15mL / hour overnight.
   -Will give fluid bolus (1000mL NS) and reassess BP and UOP
   -Renally dose meds
   - will f/u renal consult, Urine eos and casts, and FE urea
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   however unable to receive given NPO, hypotensive and PEG tube issues;
   Will restart Coreg when able.
   -Continue dig when able to give PO
   -No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously and
   coagulopathy
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFTs are no longer elevated but PTT/INR remain
   elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K in tube feeds but near
   normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this effects coumadin
   metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising, fibrinogen high,
   and haptoglobin low.
    - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -Holding heparin
   -Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days first dose today
   ICU Care
    Nutrition: NPO,  Nutren renal with 40g beneprotein @ 45mL/hour. Will
   change back if gets HD to remove protein.

","The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, shock, heart failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and coagulopathy. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, multi-lobar pneumonia, and an elevated creatinine level, indicating possible septic shock. The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including an infectious standpoint of multi-lobar pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient's heart failure is acute on chronic, with severe cardiomyopathy and low left ventricular ejection fraction. The patient's acute renal failure is pre-renal and intravascularly dry, with a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) suggestive of pre-renal etiology. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which may be related to hypovolemia and hypotension. Additionally, the patient has coagulopathy, with elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but normal platelet count and fibrinogen levels."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is a fever of 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Cultures have shown E. coli sensitivity to ceftazidime and coag-positive staphylococcus sensitivity to oxacillin. The patient was initially on CPAP and then taken off the ventilator, but had to be put back on due to increased respiratory rate and ABG values indicating respiratory failure. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and they have a history of chronic renal failure, acute-on-chronic heart failure, and acute renal failure. The patient's blood pressure is low, and they have poor peripheral pulses, suggesting possible poor perfusion from sepsis and congestive heart failure. The patient has an elevated temperature, and there are many white blood cells present in their urine, suggesting a possible urinary tract infection. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including clindamycin, ceftazidime, and nafcillin. They are currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the fever. The patient's vital signs include a high heart rate, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 17 mmH"

   [**9-14**] blood, stool, urine cx pending
   Imaging: CXR [**9-15**]: Increased opacitiy in lung fields per my read,
   awaiting official read by radiology
   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
    Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin yesterday ([**9-12**]). Will renally
   dose nafcillin.
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Pt tolerated PSV w/ [**9-9**] overnight, required brief rest on AC this
   morning.  Will continue on PSV.
    # SHOCK
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotensive overnight with elevated Cr in addition to respiratory
   failure and CVP 23.
   - Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not have a
   good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**].
   - Mixed venous O2 [**9-13**]. If <60% will consider cardiac shock more
   likely. >70% sepsis would be more likely.- resulted at 68%, so does not
   clarify picture
   - Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          CVL placed [**2174-9-12**].
   -          Arterial line [**9-12**] to monitor BP
   -          CVP 23 on [**9-14**], UOP around 100 mL/hr
   -          Continue Ceftaz
   -          Continue Nafcillin
   -          D/c
d Flagyl as above
   -          Cultures re-sent, will f/u results
   -          Tylenol 650 q6 prn fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -          Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.41 this
   morning.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG previously 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+
   (not suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal
   state.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   - Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his coreg or
   metoprolol. Metoprolol d/c
   -  Continue with coreg, consider increasing dose from 12.5 to 25 in
   next few days
   - Continue Digoxin
   - cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
    -Holding Lasix given increased BUN/Cr
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling.
   - CT consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
   - will d/c lactulose as now stooling often
   - finished erythromycin
   - d/c Reglan
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Recent increase in
   Cr concern for new injury, possibly combined with prerenal ARF.  Renal
   consult given concern for electrolye abnormalities and increasing Cr,
   decreased UOP.  Had been discussing need for dialysis.
   - Cr continues to decrease
   - UOP increased
   - Holding lasix
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP
   # Hypernatremia:
   -          Will increase free water flushes to 300 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Consider increasing free water flushes
   # Hypokalemia:
   -          Replete K+ aggressively, using PO preferentially over IV
   replacement
   -          Follow electrolytes
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Continue carvedilol, consider increasing dose as above
   - Continue digoxin
   - No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously and
   coagulopathy
   - Will consider adding back Coumadin in next few days
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFTs are no longer elevated but PTT/INR remain
   elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K in tube feeds but near
   normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this effects coumadin
   metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising, fibrinogen high,
   and haptoglobin low.
   - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -Holding heparin
   - INR 1.4 today down from 2.6 on [**9-13**]
   - Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days last dose today ([**9-15**])
   ICU Care
   -Nutrition: NPO,  Nutren renal with 40g beneprotein @ 45mL/hour. Will
   change back if gets HD to remove protein.  Increased free water flushes
   as above.
   Glycemic Control:  Insulin SS, raised standing NPH to 12U q12H
   -Lines:  L PICC,  Left subclavian CVL [**2174-9-12**], Arterial line [**2174-9-12**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of severe cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including sedatives, pain medications, and antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. His oxygen saturation is maintained at 100% with the use of supplemental oxygen. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Lab results indicate renal dysfunction with elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. There is also evidence of metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged PTT and INR, indicating coagulopathy.

Imaging studies reveal increased opacities in the lung fields, suggestive of multi-lobar pneumonia. The patient's recent blood, stool, and urine cultures are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, with contributions from multi-lobar pneumonia and congestive heart failure. The patient will continue on atrovent nebs as needed and receive appropriate antibiotic therapy for MSSA and Pseudomonas infections.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock as well as cardiac shock. Antibiotics have"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin yesterday ([**9-12**]). Will renally
   dose nafcillin.
   - C.diff negative, will d/c Flagyl per ID
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Tried on trach mask [**9-13**], rapidly became tachypnic to 40s, placed
   back on vent.  Was still hyperventilating on AC (7.41/31/169).  This
   morning will try PSV with PEEP of 8 and
    # SHOCK
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotensive overnight with elevated Cr in addition to respiratory
   failure and CVP 23.
   - Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not have a
   good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**].
   - Mixed venous O2 [**9-13**]. If <60% will consider cardiac shock more
   likely. >70% sepsis would be more likely.- resulted at 68%, so does not
   clarify picture
   - Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          CVL placed [**2174-9-12**].
   -          Arterial line [**9-12**] to monitor BP
   -          CVP 23 on [**9-14**], UOP around 100 mL/hr
   -          Continue Ceftaz
   -          Continue Nafcillin
   -          D/c
d Flagyl as above
   -          Cultures re-sent, will f/u results
   -          Tylenol 650 q6 prn fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -          Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.41 this
   morning.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG previously 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+
   (not suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal
   state.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   - Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his coreg or
   metoprolol. Metoprolol d/c
   -  Continue with coreg
   - Continue Digoxin
   - cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
   - UOP
    -Holding Lasix given increased BUN/Cr
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling.
   - CT consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
   - added lactulose enema to bowel regimen
   - finished erythromycin
   - d/c Reglan
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now stable; likely
   pre-renal and intravascularly dry [**3-5**] intense diuresis. FeNa suggestive
   of pre-renal etiology at <1%.  Now concerning for increased Cr.
   - Cr decreased slightly overnight
   - UOP increased following decreased temp and increased CVPs
   -Holding lasix
   -Will continue to bolus as necessary
   -Renally dose meds
   - Fena 1.5%, no urine eos, 4 hyaline casts
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Continue dig
   - No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously and
   coagulopathy
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFTs are no longer elevated but PTT/INR remain
   elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K in tube feeds but near
   normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this effects coumadin
   metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising, fibrinogen high,
   and haptoglobin low.
   - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -Holding heparin
   - INR 1.9 today down from 2.6 on [**9-13**]
   - Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days first dose today
   ICU Care
   -Nutrition: NPO,  Nutren renal with 40g beneprotein @ 45mL/hour. Will
   change back if gets HD to remove protein.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include respiratory failure, acute on chronic heart failure (CHF), shock (likely septic and cardiac), acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, and potential metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, with contributing factors including multi-lobar pneumonia and CHF. The patient is receiving various respiratory support measures, including the use of a tracheostomy, atrovent nebs, and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's heart failure is chronic in nature, with a significantly reduced ejection fraction of only 10%. The patient's coreg and metoprolol medications have been adjusted accordingly.

The patient is also experiencing shock, with evidence of hypotension and elevated creatinine levels. This may be due to septic shock as well as cardiac shock. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation has been monitored to help differentiate between the two.

Acute renal failure has occurred, which is likely pre-renal in nature. The patient's urine output has improved following fluid resuscitation, and medications are being renally dosed as necessary.

The patient is also dealing with atrial fibrillation, for which they are being treated with carvedilol and digoxin. Anti-coagulation has been withheld due to the patient's coagulopathy and recent oozing from the PEG site.

Coagulopathy is present,"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin yesterday ([**9-12**]). Will renally
   dose nafcillin.
   - C.diff negative, will d/c Flagyl per ID
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Tried on trach mask [**9-13**], rapidly became tachypnic to 40s, placed
   back on vent.  Was still hyperventilating on AC (7.41/31/169).  This
   morning will try PSV with PEEP of 8 and
    # SHOCK
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotensive overnight with elevated Cr in addition to respiratory
   failure and CVP 23.
   - Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not have a
   good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**].
   - Mixed venous O2 [**9-13**]. If <60% will consider cardiac shock more
   likely. >70% sepsis would be more likely.- resulted at 68%, so does not
   clarify picture
   - Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          CVL placed [**2174-9-12**].
   -          Arterial line [**9-12**] to monitor BP
   -          CVP 23 on [**9-14**], UOP around 100 mL/hr
   -          Continue Ceftaz
   -          Continue Nafcillin
   -          D/c
d Flagyl as above
   -          Cultures re-sent, will f/u results
   -          Tylenol 650 q6 prn fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -          Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.41 this
   morning.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG previously 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+
   (not suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal
   state.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   - Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his coreg or
   metoprolol. Metoprolol d/c
   -  Continue with coreg
   - Continue Digoxin
   - cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
   - UOP
    -Holding Lasix given increased BUN/Cr
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling.
   - CT consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
   - added lactulose enema to bowel regimen
   - finished erythromycin
   - d/c Reglan
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Now stable; likely
   pre-renal and intravascularly dry [**3-5**] intense diuresis. FeNa suggestive
   of pre-renal etiology at <1%.  Now concerning for increased Cr.
   - Cr decreased slightly overnight
   - UOP increased following decreased temp and increased CVPs
   -Holding lasix
   -Will continue to bolus as necessary
   -Renally dose meds
   - Fena 1.5%, no urine eos, 4 hyaline casts
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Continue carvedilol
   - Continue dig
   - No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously and
   coagulopathy
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFTs are no longer elevated but PTT/INR remain
   elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K in tube feeds but near
   normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this effects coumadin
   metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising, fibrinogen high,
   and haptoglobin low.
   - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -Holding heparin
   - INR 1.9 today down from 2.6 on [**9-13**]
   - Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days first dose today
   ICU Care
   -Nutrition: NPO,  Nutren renal with 40g beneprotein @ 45mL/hour. Will

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely due to multi-lobar pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been given various respiratory treatments.

2. Septic Shock: The patient continues to be febrile with positive sputum cultures and hypotensive overnight, indicating a possible septic shock. This is further supported by the elevated creatinine levels and the presence of Pseudomonas in the urine.

3. Cardiac Shock: The patient's low mixed venous oxygen saturation suggests the possibility of cardiac shock. However, further clarification is needed as the results did not clearly indicate whether it is more likely sepsis or cardiac shock.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has a pH of 7.41, suggesting metabolic alkalosis. This could be due to a large volume diuresis. Aggressive potassium chloride administration is planned to maintain a potassium level above 4.5.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by the increased creatinine levels. The cause is likely pre-renal and intravascularly dry, possibly due to intense diuresis. Renal dosing of medications will be necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for multi-lobar pneumonia contributing to the respiratory failure, along with congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 10%.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock as well as cardiac shock. The elevated creatinine levels and hypotension suggest renal dysfunction and inadequate perfusion.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has a pH level of 7.41, indicating metabolic alkalosis. This could be due to a large volume diuresis.

4. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute on Chronic: The patient has severe cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of only 10%. There is ongoing concern for fluid overload and hypotension, leading to decreased medication dosages.

5. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by increased creatinine levels and a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) less than 1%, suggesting pre-renal etiology.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
    Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%). Has
   [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations off and on with matching alkalemic blood
   gases.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin ([**9-12**]).
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Will try SBT today to trach mask and see how he does with that.
    # Shock:  Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not
   have a good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**] as mixed venous O2 [**9-13**] was 68%. UOP
   has increased and hypotension has slowly been resolving over last 2
   days.  Pt does continue to spike fevers though.
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotension better at 100s/50s instead of 80s/30s.  CVP at 18.
   -        Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   (started [**2174-9-10**] until [**2174-9-18**])
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          Cultures re-sent, will f/u results
   -          Tylenol 650 q6 fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -          Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.41 this
   morning.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG previously 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+
   (not suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal
   state.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   - Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his coreg or
   metoprolol. Metoprolol d/c
   -  Continue with coreg, consider increasing dose from 12.5 to 25 in
   next few days
   - cards suggested starting heparin, held at first given  oozing of PEG.
   Given 5% risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not
   feel strongly on starting heparin
    -Holding Lasix given increased BUN/Cr although may consider if UOP
   decreases and seems volume overloaded.
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling ~500mL/day.
   - CT consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
   - will d/c lactulose as now stooling often
   - finished erythromycin
   - d/c Reglan
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Recent increase in
   Cr concern for new injury, possibly combined with prerenal ARF.  Renal
   consult given concern for electrolye abnormalities and increasing Cr,
   decreased UOP.  Had been discussing need for dialysis, however in the
   last few days UOP has increased and creatinine has gone down.
   - Cr continues to decrease
   - UOP increased
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP
   # Hypernatremia: Most likely a result of insensible losses and not
   enough free water in TPN, however with increased UOP some concern for
   DI.
   -          Will increase free water flushes to 400 mL q 2 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Will change fluids to D5W and try to put meds in this fluid.
   # Hypokalemia:
   -          Replete K+ aggressively, using PO preferentially over IV
   replacement
   -                 Follow electrolytes
   -                 On K SS
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Increase carvedilol to 25mg QD
   - Will restart coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose)
   #COAGULOPATHY
 Now resolved but possible sources included hepatic and
   nutritional
   - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -                 Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days last dose  ([**9-15**])
   -
   ICU Care
   -Nutrition: NPO,  Nutren renal with 40g beneprotein @ 45mL/hour. Will
   change back if gets HD to remove protein.  Increased free water flushes
   as above.
   Glycemic Control:  Insulin SS, raised standing NPH to 18U q12H because
   sugars were 160-190 and will get D5w.
   -Lines:  Left subclavian CVL [**2174-9-12**], Arterial line [**2174-9-12**]
   -Prophylaxis:
   DVT: Pneumoboots, Heparin SC
   Stress ulcer:  Famotidine
   VAP:
   -Communication:  Comments:  Family aware patient is very ill.
   -Code status: DNR (no CPR, no shocks). Will take pressors, intubation
   and HD.
   -Disposition: ICU
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an obese man in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to multi-lobar pneumonia and chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient also has acute renal failure, which is improving with increased urine output. The patient has hypernatremia, likely caused by insensible losses and inadequate free water administration. There is also evidence of hypokalemia, which is being aggressively treated. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy. The patient has a history of coagulopathy, which has been resolved. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, heparin sodium, and other medications for various conditions. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 102.9°F, heart rate 109 bpm, blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, blood glucose levels, and liver enzymes. The patient's physical examination reveals significant scrotal edema and 1+ edema in both lower extremities. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever, chills, and chest pain. The patient is unable to communicate effectively due to being on a ventilator and tracheostomy tube"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
    Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin ([**9-12**]).
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Pts latest ABG with sign of hyperventilation. [**Month (only) 60**] turn down rate
   and/or tidal volume if patient can tolerate.
    # SHOCK:  Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not
   have a good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**] as mixed venous O2 [**9-13**] was 68%. UOP
   has increased and hypotension has slowly been resolving over last 2
   days.  Pt does continue to spike fevers though.
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotension better at 100s/50s instead of 80s/30s.  CVP at 18.
   -        Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   (started [**2174-9-10**])
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          Cultures re-sent, will f/u results
   -          Tylenol 650 q6 prn fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -          Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.41 this
   morning.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG previously 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+
   (not suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal
   state.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   - Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his coreg or
   metoprolol. Metoprolol d/c
   -  Continue with coreg, consider increasing dose from 12.5 to 25 in
   next few days
   - Continue Digoxin
   - cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
    -Holding Lasix given increased BUN/Cr
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling.
   - CT consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
   - will d/c lactulose as now stooling often
   - finished erythromycin
   - d/c Reglan
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Recent increase in
   Cr concern for new injury, possibly combined with prerenal ARF.  Renal
   consult given concern for electrolye abnormalities and increasing Cr,
   decreased UOP.  Had been discussing need for dialysis, however in the
   last few days UOP has increased and creatinine has gone down.
   - Cr continues to decrease
   - UOP increased
   - Holding lasix
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP
   # Hypernatremia: Most likely a result of insensible losses and not
   enough free water in TPN, however with increased
   -          Will increase free water flushes to 400 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Will change fluids to
 NS instead of NS.
   # Hypokalemia:
   -          Replete K+ aggressively, using PO preferentially over IV
   replacement
   -          Follow electrolytes
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Continue carvedilol, consider increasing dose
   - Continue digoxin
   - No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously and
   coagulopathy
   - Will consider adding back Coumadin in next few days
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFTs are no longer elevated but PTT/INR remain
   elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K in tube feeds but near
   normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this effects coumadin
   metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising, fibrinogen high,
   and haptoglobin low.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 10%. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute on chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, atrial fibrillation, and coagulopathy. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and increased free water flushes. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, potassium, bicarbonate, and lactate. His arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. The patient's physical examination reveals signs of multi-lobar pneumonia, significant scrotal edema, and bilateral lower extremity edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the underlying chronic heart failure and multi-lobar pneumonia.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest acute kidney injury, which could be caused by hypoperfusion, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever, hyp"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
    Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%)
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin yesterday ([**9-12**]). Will renally
   dose nafcillin.
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Pt tolerated PSV w/ [**9-9**] overnight, required brief rest on AC this
   morning.  Will continue on PSV.
    # SHOCK
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotensive overnight with elevated Cr in addition to respiratory
   failure and CVP 23.
   - Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not have a
   good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**].
   - Mixed venous O2 [**9-13**]. If <60% will consider cardiac shock more
   likely. >70% sepsis would be more likely.- resulted at 68%, so does not
   clarify picture
   - Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          CVL placed [**2174-9-12**].
   -          Arterial line [**9-12**] to monitor BP
   -          CVP 23 on [**9-14**], UOP around 100 mL/hr
   -          Continue Ceftaz
   -          Continue Nafcillin
   -          D/c
d Flagyl as above
   -          Cultures re-sent, will f/u results
   -          Tylenol 650 q6 prn fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -          Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.41 this
   morning.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG previously 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+
   (not suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal
   state.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   - Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his coreg or
   metoprolol. Metoprolol d/c
   -  Continue with coreg, consider increasing dose from 12.5 to 25 in
   next few days
   - Continue Digoxin
   - cards suggested starting heparin, will hold for now given recent
   oozing of PEG and possibility of procedures in near future.  Given 5%
   risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not feel
   strongly on starting heparin
    -Holding Lasix given increased BUN/Cr
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling.
   - CT consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
   - will d/c lactulose as now stooling often
   - finished erythromycin
   - d/c Reglan
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Recent increase in
   Cr concern for new injury, possibly combined with prerenal ARF.  Renal
   consult given concern for electrolye abnormalities and increasing Cr,
   decreased UOP.  Had been discussing need for dialysis.
   - Cr continues to decrease
   - UOP increased
   - Holding lasix
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP
   # Hypernatremia:
   -          Will increase free water flushes to 300 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Consider increasing free water flushes
   # Hypokalemia:
   -          Replete K+ aggressively, using PO preferentially over IV
   replacement
   -          Follow electrolytes
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Continue carvedilol, consider increasing dose as above
   - Continue digoxin
   - No anti-coagulation for now given oozing from peg site previously and
   coagulopathy
   - Will consider adding back Coumadin in next few days
   #COAGULOPATHY - possible sources since the last coumadin was given on
   [**8-24**] include hepatic and nutritional.  Hepatic possible given poor CO
   and episodic hypotension, however would expect higher LFTs if cause was
   ischemia. Of note LFTs are no longer elevated but PTT/INR remain
   elevated. Nutrition possible since no Vit K in tube feeds but near
   normal alb. a source could be levaquin, as this effects coumadin
   metabolism. DIC unlikely since platelets are rising, fibrinogen high,
   and haptoglobin low.
   - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -Holding heparin
   - INR 1.4 today down from 2.6 on [**9-13**]
   - Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days last dose today ([**9-15**])
   ICU Care
   -Nutrition: NPO,  Nutren renal with 40g beneprotein @ 45mL/hour. Will

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of severe cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.9°F, blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg, heart rate of 109 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with neutrophilia, increased blood glucose levels, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's imaging studies reveal multi-lobar pneumonia and evidence of ileus on CT scan. He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, acute on chronic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, heparin, cefazidime, nafcillin, and insulin. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is elevated at 23, and his urine output has improved.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, acute kidney injury, worsening heart failure, and potential bleeding due to coagulopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) and prolonged intubation now with trach.
   He is dependent on cardiac output for renal function and is exquisitely
   sensitive to changes in perfusion. He has been continued to be
   difficult to wean from the ventilator.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
    Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%). Has
   [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations off and on with matching alkalemic blood
   gases.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin ([**9-12**]).
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Will try sitting in chair to decrease effects of obeisity on
   ventilation.
    # Shock:  Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not
   have a good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**] as mixed venous O2 [**9-13**] was 68%. UOP
   has increased and hypotension has slowly been resolving over last 2
   days.  Pt does continue to spike fevers though.
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotension better at 100s/50s instead of 80s/30s.  CVP at 18.
   -        Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   (started [**2174-9-10**] until [**2174-9-18**])
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          Cultures re-sent, will f/u results
   -          Tylenol 650 q6 fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -          Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.41 this
   morning.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG previously 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+
   (not suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal
   state.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   -          Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his
   coreg or metoprolol. Metoprolol d/c
   -          Continue with coreg, consider increasing dose from 12.5 to
   25 in next few days
   -          cards suggested starting heparin, held at first given
   oozing of PEG. Given 5% risk of event per year and limit expected pt
   lifespan, do not feel strongly on starting heparin
   -          Holding Lasix given increased BUN/Cr although may consider
   if UOP decreases and seems volume overloaded.
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling ~500mL/day.
   - CT consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
   - will d/c lactulose as now stooling often
   - finished erythromycin
   - d/c Reglan
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   - When UOP is good take U and S electrolytes and OSMs.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible
   -          Will increase free water flushes to 400 mL q 2 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Will change fluids to D5W and try to put meds in this fluid.
   # Hypokalemia:
   -          Replete K+ aggressively, using PO preferentially over IV
   replacement
   -                 Follow electrolytes
   -                 On K SS
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Increase carvedilol to 25mg QD
   - Will restart coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose)
   #COAGULOPATHY
 Now resolved but possible sources included hepatic and
   nutritional
   - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -                 Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days last dose  ([**9-15**])
   -
   ICU Care
   -Nutrition: NPO,  Nutren renal with 40g beneprotein @ 45mL/hour. Will
   change back if gets HD to remove protein.  Increased free water flushes
   as above.
   Glycemic Control:  Insulin SS, raised standing NPH to 18U q12H because
   sugars were 160-190 and will get D5w.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male who has a history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10%, and prolonged intubation. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute on chronic, likely multifactorial including multi-lobar pneumonia and CHF. The patient is also experiencing shock, likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock. He has increased body temperature (fever), hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient's urine output has improved, and his blood pressure is slowly resolving. He has positive sputum cultures, and his CVP is at 18.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS. The cause is likely multifactorial including multi-lobar pneumonia and CHF. Treatment includes continuing atrovent nebs prn, sitting in a chair to decrease the effects of obesity on ventilation, daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA, and trying to wean off the ventilator.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock as well as cardiac shock. Treatment includes aggressive fluid resuscitation, antibiotics for MSSA and Pseudomonas, and monitoring UOP.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis likely due to large volume diuresis. Treatment includes giving KCL aggressively to maintain potassium levels"

   hypotension better at 100s/50s instead of 80s/30s.  CVP at 18.
   -        Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   (started [**2174-9-10**] until [**2174-9-18**])
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          Cultures re-sent, will f/u results
   -          Tylenol 650 q6 fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -          Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.41 this
   morning.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG previously 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+
   (not suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal
   state.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   - Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his coreg or
   metoprolol. Metoprolol d/c
   -  Continue with coreg, consider increasing dose from 12.5 to 25 in
   next few days
   - cards suggested starting heparin, held at first given  oozing of PEG.
   Given 5% risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not
   feel strongly on starting heparin
    -Holding Lasix given increased BUN/Cr although may consider if UOP
   decreases and seems volume overloaded.
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling ~500mL/day.
   - CT consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
   - will d/c lactulose as now stooling often
   - finished erythromycin
   - d/c Reglan
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Recent increase in
   Cr concern for new injury, possibly combined with prerenal ARF.  Renal
   consult given concern for electrolye abnormalities and increasing Cr,
   decreased UOP.  Had been discussing need for dialysis, however in the
   last few days UOP has increased and creatinine has gone down.
   - Cr continues to decrease
   - UOP increased
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP
   # Hypernatremia: Most likely a result of insensible losses and not
   enough free water in TPN, however with increased UOP some concern for
   DI.
   -          Will increase free water flushes to 400 mL q 2 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Will change fluids to D5W and try to put meds in this fluid.
   # Hypokalemia:
   -          Replete K+ aggressively, using PO preferentially over IV
   replacement
   -                 Follow electrolytes
   -                 On K SS
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Increase carvedilol to 25mg QD
   - Will restart coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose)
   #COAGULOPATHY
 Now resolved but possible sources included hepatic and
   nutritional
   - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -                 Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days last dose  ([**9-15**])
   -
   ICU Care
   -Nutrition: NPO,  Nutren renal with 40g beneprotein @ 45mL/hour. Will
   change back if gets HD to remove protein.  Increased free water flushes
   as above.
   Glycemic Control:  Insulin SS, raised standing NPH to 18U q12H because
   sugars were 160-190 and will get D5w.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of severe cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure (EF 10%). The patient presented to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, possibly due to multi-lobar pneumonia and acute on chronic heart failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by septic shock, metabolic alkalosis, acute renal failure, ileus, atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and coagulopathy.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, involving pneumonia and heart failure. The patient is currently on ventilatory support with a tracheostomy tube.

2. Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock as well as cardiac shock. The mixed venous O2 saturation was low at 68%, indicating poor tissue perfusion. Hypotension has slowly improved, and the central venous pressure (CVP) is now 18.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis with a pH of 7.41. This is likely due to a large volume diuresis. Aggressive potassium chloride replacement is recommended to maintain a potassium level above 4.5.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with an increase in creatinine. This could be due to a new injury or combined prerenal and intrinsic renal failure. Renal consultation was given,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU for management of acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure and acute renal failure. On admission, he was in shock, respiratory failure, and required mechanical ventilation. His current condition is stable, but he continues to experience fever, hypertension, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate worsening renal function. This could lead to further fluid accumulation, electrolyte imbalances, and potential need for dialysis.
2. Heart failure: The patient's history of chronic heart failure increases the risk of fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is essential.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma. Frequent assessment of respiratory status and adherence to weaning protocols are crucial.
4. Fever and infection: The patient's persistent fever suggests an ongoing infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy to prevent sepsis.
5. Hypertension and tachycardia: The patient's high blood pressure and elevated heart rate may indicate inadequate control of hypertension or stress response to illness. Proper"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
    Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint,
   multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%). Has
   [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations off and on with matching alkalemic blood
   gases.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin ([**9-12**]).
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Will try SBT today to trach mask and see how he does with that.
    # Shock:  Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not
   have a good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**] as mixed venous O2 [**9-13**] was 68%. UOP
   has increased and hypotension has slowly been resolving over last 2
   days.  Pt does continue to spike fevers though.
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, has + sputum cultures,
   hypotension better at 100s/50s instead of 80s/30s.  CVP at 18.
   -        Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   (started [**2174-9-10**] until [**2174-9-18**])
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          Cultures re-sent, will f/u results
   -          Tylenol 650 q6 fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -          Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH 7.41 this
   morning.
   -          aggressively give KCL, goal K > 4.5
   -          TTKG previously 12.7, consistent with renal losses of K+
   (not suggestive of GI loss) will consider work up for hyperadrenal
   state.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
    Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   - Pt has been hypotensive and therefore not receiving his coreg or
   metoprolol. Metoprolol d/c
   -  Continue with coreg, consider increasing dose from 12.5 to 25 in
   next few days
   - cards suggested starting heparin, held at first given  oozing of PEG.
   Given 5% risk of event per year and limit expected pt lifespan, do not
   feel strongly on starting heparin
    -Holding Lasix given increased BUN/Cr although may consider if UOP
   decreases and seems volume overloaded.
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling ~500mL/day.
   - CT consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
   - will d/c lactulose as now stooling often
   - finished erythromycin
   - d/c Reglan
   - monitor PEG residuals.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- Recent increase in
   Cr concern for new injury, possibly combined with prerenal ARF.  Renal
   consult given concern for electrolye abnormalities and increasing Cr,
   decreased UOP.  Had been discussing need for dialysis, however in the
   last few days UOP has increased and creatinine has gone down.
   - Cr continues to decrease
   - UOP increased
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP
   # Hypernatremia: Most likely a result of insensible losses and not
   enough free water in TPN, however with increased UOP some concern for
   DI.
   -          Will increase free water flushes to 400 mL q 2 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Will change fluids to D5W and try to put meds in this fluid.
   # Hypokalemia:
   -          Replete K+ aggressively, using PO preferentially over IV
   replacement
   -                 Follow electrolytes
   -                 On K SS
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Increase carvedilol to 25mg QD
   - Will restart coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose)
   #COAGULOPATHY
 Now resolved but possible sources included hepatic and
   nutritional
   - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -                 Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days last dose  ([**9-15**])
   -
   ICU Care
   -Nutrition: NPO,  Nutren renal with 40g beneprotein @ 45mL/hour. Will
   change back if gets HD to remove protein.  Increased free water flushes
   as above.
   Glycemic Control:  Insulin SS, raised standing NPH to 18U q12H because
   sugars were 160-190 and will get D5w.

   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) and prolonged intubation now with trach.
   He is dependent on cardiac output for renal function and is exquisitely
   sensitive to changes in perfusion. He has been continued to be
   difficult to wean from the ventilator.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])  Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint, multi-lobar pneumonia
   is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**]
   respirations off and on with matching alkalemic blood gases.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin ([**9-12**]).
   - Will finish Abx today
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Will continue sitting in chair to decrease effects of obeisity on
   ventilation.
    # Shock:  Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not
   have a good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**] as mixed venous O2 [**9-13**] was 68%. UOP
   has increased and hypotension has slowly been resolving.  Pt does
   continue to spike fevers but is hemodynamically stable
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, had + sputum cultures,
   hypotension better now. BPs 100/50
   -         Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   (started [**2174-9-10**] until [**2174-9-18**])
   -         Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -         Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   -         Finishing Abx [**9-18**], has been concern that temps are due to
   drugs, will monitor off abx.  CXR also concerning for infection,  but
   will f/u cx before starting antibiotics.
   -         If hypotensive, will bolus with NS
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH NL now
   - Continue to monitor ABGs.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   -          Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with coreg at 25mg
   -          cards suggested starting heparin, held at first given
   oozing of PEG. Given 5% risk of event per year and limit expected pt
   lifespan, do not feel strongly on starting heparin
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   - When UOP is good take U and S electrolytes and OSMs.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible
   -          Free water flushes to 300 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Changed fluids to D5W and put meds in this fluid.
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10

    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Increased carvedilol to 25mg QD

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by septic shock, likely due to a multi-lobar pneumonia and cardiac shock. His renal function is compromised, and he has metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's coagulopathy has been resolved, and he is receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including infectious pneumonia and CHF. Continued monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation will be necessary.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock may be due to a multi-lobar pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and close monitoring of hemodynamic status is required.
3. Cardiac Shock: The patient's cardiac output is compromised, leading to cardiac shock. Continued optimization of cardiac support and management of CHF is necessary.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and careful monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is required. Adjustments to diuretic therapy may be necessary.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) and prolonged intubation now with trach.
   He is dependent on cardiac output for renal function and is exquisitely
   sensitive to changes in perfusion. He has been continued to be
   difficult to wean from the ventilator.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])  Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint, multi-lobar pneumonia
   is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**]
   respirations off and on with matching alkalemic blood gases.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin ([**9-12**]).
   - Will finish Abx today
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Will continue sitting in chair to decrease effects of obeisity on
   ventilation.
    # Shock:  Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not
   have a good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**] as mixed venous O2 [**9-13**] was 68%. UOP
   has increased and hypotension has slowly been resolving.  Pt does
   continue to spike fevers but is hemodynamically stable
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, had + sputum cultures,
   hypotension better now. BPs 100/50
   -        Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   (started [**2174-9-10**] until [**2174-9-18**])
   -          Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -          Tylenol 650 q6 fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -          Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH NL now
   - Continue to monitor ABGs.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   -          Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with coreg at 25mg
   -          cards suggested starting heparin, held at first given
   oozing of PEG. Given 5% risk of event per year and limit expected pt
   lifespan, do not feel strongly on starting heparin
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   - When UOP is good take U and S electrolytes and OSMs.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible
   -          Will increase free water flushes to 400 mL q 2 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Changed fluids to D5W and put meds in this fluid.
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling ~500mL/day.
   - CT was consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Increased carvedilol to 25mg QD

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and prolonged intubation. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, acute on chronic, due to multi-lobar pneumonia and CHF. The patient has been difficult to wean from the ventilator and is dependent on cardiac output for renal function. He also has metabolic alkalosis, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, ileus, atrial fibrillation, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, involving both infectious and cardiac causes. The pneumonia contributes to respiratory distress, and the patient's CHF exacerbates the situation. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.

2. Cardiac Shock: The patient's low cardiac output may lead to cardiac shock. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, especially blood pressure and heart rate, is essential. Fluid administration and inotropic support may be required.

3. Septic Shock: The patient's persistent fever and hypotension suggest the possibility of septic shock. Regular assessment of vital signs and monitoring of blood cultures are necessary. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics is crucial.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to decreased cardiac output. Close monitoring of urine output, serum creatinine, and electrolytes is necessary. Fluid management and di"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and prolonged intubation. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute on chronic, and has multi-lobar pneumonia contributing to his condition along with CHF. The patient has been difficult to wean from the ventilator and is dependent on cardiac output for renal function. He is also febrile and has positive sputum cultures for MSSA and urine culture for Pseudomonas.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, with contributions from infectious pneumonia and CHF. Continuous monitoring and supportive care, such as atrovent nebs, are necessary.

2. Shock: The patient is at risk for septic shock due to the presence of infection and hypotension. Close monitoring of hemodynamic stability and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are crucial.

3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient may have metabolic alkalosis due to a large volume diuresis. ABG monitoring should be continued to assess and manage any imbalances.

4. Heart Failure: The patient has severe cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of only 10%. Ongoing management with medications like coreg and careful fluid balance are important.

5. Renal Failure: The patient is at risk for acute renal failure (ARF) due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%, and prolonged intubation. He has been difficult to wean from the ventilator and is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to multifactorial causes including multi-lobar pneumonia and CHF. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock as well as cardiac shock, and is showing signs of improvement with increasing urine output and resolution of hypotension. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: Continue to provide respiratory support and monitor blood gases.
2. Infection: Switched from clindamycin to nafcillin due to MSSA sensitivity. Continue daily chest X-rays to monitor for aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotics have been adjusted based on sputum and urine cultures.
3. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock as well as cardiac shock. Monitor for any further signs of hypotension or fever.

   EKG: Not found in chart.
   CXR:
   The current study is extremely limited due to underpenetration and
   motion
   artifacts. Within the limitation of the study, the tracheostomy tube is
   noted
   with the tip at the midline, 5 cm above the carina. Most likely
   bilateral
   hilar enlargement is present as well as right lower lobe opacity. Since
   this
   exam is extremely limited, further repeated study is highly
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) who was admitted for respiratory distress
   after being found down in his home. He has had a prolonged intubation,
   now with trach since [**9-3**]. He is dependent on cardiac output for
   renal function and renal function is exquisitely sensitive to changes
   in perfusion. He has been continued to be difficult to wean from the
   ventilator.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]). Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, as is severe
   CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations intermittently, with
   alkalemic blood gases. Most recent blood gas is reassuring at
   7.39/31/181 on the ventilator. CXR from today is limited by motion
   artifact, but yesterday
s was concerning for new RLL infiltrate.
   - Resend sputum today.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - F/u gram stains and cxs.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx (ceftazidime and nafcillin) were given for pos MSSA and E. coli
   sputum cx. Finished yesterday. However due to concern for RLL
   infiltrate, in setting of unusually high fever and rising WBC, should
   talk to ID about restarting previous antibiotics versus starting vanc
   and zosyn.
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entirely, extended MICU course.
   However, recent spike to 103.1 is higher than previous fevers to 100s
   and 101s. WBC also up to 20.3 today, from 17.4 yesterday.
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 and cooling blanket for fever.
   -          Resend sputum.
   -          Repeat CXR.
   -          Send stool for c. diff.
   -          Send swab from surrounding PEG for gram stain and cx.
   -          Talk to ID about their antibiotic recommendations, as above.
   -          No need to change lines now, but consider pending blood cx
   results.
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   - Talk to ID about antibiotics.
   -         Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed.
   - Continue to monitor UOP.
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent. Up to 170s yesterday, likely
   exacerbated by fever.
   -          Carvedilol 25mg once daily.
   -          Continue to monitor and use fluid boluses.
   -          Consider loading with amiodarone if VT becomes sustained or
   leads to hemodynamic instability.
   -          Continue to treat fever and other comorbidities.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with coreg at 25mg.
   -          Continue coumadin 5mg Qdaily (home dose, which pt has been
   back on since [**9-17**]).
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - Carvedilol 25mg QD
   - restarted coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose) [**2174-9-17**]
   - Following INR, which is now 1.3.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.0
   today. Renal signed off yesterday.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   - f/u U and S electrolytes and osms.
   #COAGULOPATHY: Now resolved but possible sources included hepatic and
   nutritional. Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well. Vit K 10mg QD for
   3 days last dose ([**9-15**]). Now coumadinized, with INR = 1.3.
   - Continue to follow.
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH NL now.
   - Continue to monitor ABGs.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          Free water flushes decreased to 200 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a
   problem.  Pt [**Name2 (NI) 1824**] well.
   - continue to monitor stools.

   about Mr. [**Known lastname 496**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure (CHF), who was admitted for respiratory distress. He has had prolonged intubation and tracheostomy since September 3rd. The patient is dependent on cardiac output for renal function and is experiencing acute respiratory failure due to multi-lobar pneumonia and severe CHF. He also has atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and hypernatremia. The patient's current condition is stable, but he remains febrile and has an elevated white blood cell count. He is on multiple antibiotics, and the source of infection is still being investigated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has experienced intermittent ventricular tachycardia up to 170s, which can lead to hemodynamic instability. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and consider loading with amiodarone if the VT becomes sustained or leads to hemodynamic instability.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock due to the fever, hypotension, and elevated WBC count. Close monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and urine output is necessary. Fluid boluses and vasopressors may be required to maintain adequate perfusion.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and his cardiac output is barely enough to"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and prolonged intubation. He has been in the ICU for an extended period due to respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial including multi-lobar pneumonia and CHF. The patient's cardiac output is dependent on renal function, and he is sensitive to changes in perfusion. He has been difficult to wean from the ventilator. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and there may be a risk of worsening respiratory distress or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Shock: The patient is at risk of septic shock and cardiac shock, given his hypotension and increased lactate levels. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and timely intervention are essential.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, likely secondary to diuresis. It is important to monitor ABGs and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Heart Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of only 10%. Optimization of cardiac support and monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure are necessary.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to decreased cardiac output. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate fluid management are crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) and prolonged intubation now with trach.
   He is dependent on cardiac output for renal function and is exquisitely
   sensitive to changes in perfusion. He has been continued to be
   difficult to wean from the ventilator.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])  Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  From an infectious standpoint, multi-lobar pneumonia
   is contributing in addition to CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**]
   respirations off and on with matching alkalemic blood gases.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn
   -[**9-8**] sputum, showed MSSA, therefore d/c vanc. Had added flagyl for
   concern of aspiration pna.  As per ID switched to clindamycin  450mg IV
   q6h for MSSA and anerobe coverage.  However, clinda sensitivities were
   not listed, called lab to add on clindamycin sensitivity, will be ready
   [**9-12**]. Switched from clinda to nafcillin ([**9-12**]).
   - Will finish Abx today
   -daily CXR to monitor for aspiration PNA.
   - Will continue sitting in chair to decrease effects of obeisity on
   ventilation.
    # Shock:  Likely septic shock as well as cardiac shock although do not
   have a good gauge of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4218**] as mixed venous O2 [**9-13**] was 68%. UOP
   has increased and hypotension has slowly been resolving.  Pt does
   continue to spike fevers but is hemodynamically stable
   -         Pt continues to be febrile, had + sputum cultures,
   hypotension better now. BPs 100/50
   -         Urine grew Pseudomonas, continue on Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV
   (started [**2174-9-10**] until [**2174-9-18**])
   -         Antibiotics for sputum MSSA and urine Pseudomonas as above
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -         Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   -         Finishing Abx [**9-18**], has been concern that temps are due to
   drugs, will monitor off abx.  CXR also concerning for infection,  but
   will f/u cx before starting antibiotics.
   -         If hypotensive, will bolus with NS
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH NL now
   - Continue to monitor ABGs.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   -          Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with coreg at 25mg
   -          cards suggested starting heparin, held at first given
   oozing of PEG. Given 5% risk of event per year and limit expected pt
   lifespan, do not feel strongly on starting heparin
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   - When UOP is good take U and S electrolytes and OSMs.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible
   -          Free water flushes to 300 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Changed fluids to D5W and put meds in this fluid.
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10
   cc.  Pt stooling ~500mL/day.
   - CT was consistent with ileus, now apparently resolved
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
    - HR now in 100s likely [**3-5**] hypovolemia in addition to Afib. Will see
   if responds to fluids.
    -Cardiology consulted; transitioned from metoprolol to carvedilol
   - Increased carvedilol to 25mg QD
   - restarted coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose) [**2174-9-17**]
   - Following INR
   #COAGULOPATHY
 Now resolved but possible sources included hepatic and
   nutritional
   - Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well
   -                 Vit K 10mg QD for 3 days last dose  ([**9-15**])

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10%. He has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute on chronic, and other comorbidities. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, cardiac shock, multi-lobar pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which may be multifactorial, including infectious pneumonia and chronic heart failure. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and fever suggest septic shock. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters, urine output, and serial blood cultures is necessary to guide management.
3. Cardiac Shock: Given the patient's severe cardiomyopathy and low EF, cardiac shock is a concern. Continuous monitoring of cardiac output and adequate preload and afterload support should be provided.
4. Multi-Lobar Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of multi-lobar pneumonia, contributing to respiratory failure. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and daily chest X-rays should be performed to monitor for worsening infection or aspiration pneumonia.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised due to"

   EKG: Not found in chart.
   CXR:
   The current study is extremely limited due to underpenetration and
   motion
   artifacts. Within the limitation of the study, the tracheostomy tube is
   noted
   with the tip at the midline, 5 cm above the carina. Most likely
   bilateral
   hilar enlargement is present as well as right lower lobe opacity. Since
   this
   exam is extremely limited, further repeated study is highly
   recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) who was admitted for respiratory distress
   after being found down in his home. He has had a prolonged intubation,
   now with trach since [**9-3**]. He is dependent on cardiac output for
   renal function and renal function is exquisitely sensitive to changes
   in perfusion. He has been continued to be difficult to wean from the
   ventilator.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]). Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, as is severe
   CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations intermittently, with
   alkalemic blood gases. Most recent blood gas is reassuring at
   7.39/31/181 on the ventilator. CXR from today is limited by motion
   artifact, but yesterday
s was concerning for new RLL infiltrate.
   - Resend sputum.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - F/u gram stains and cxs.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx (ceftazidime and nafcillin) were given for pos MSSA cx. Finished
   yesterday. However due to concern for RLL infiltrate, in setting of
   unusually high fever and rising WBC, should talk to ID about restarting
   previous antibiotics versus starting vanc and zosyn.
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entirely, extended MICU course.
   However, recent spike to 103.1 is higher than previous fevers to 100s
   and 101s. WBC also up to 20.3 today, from 17.4 yesterday.
   -          Resend sputum.
   -          Repeat CXR.
   -          Send stool for c. diff.
   -          Send swab from surrounding PEG for gram stain and cx.
   -          Talk to ID about their antibiotic recommendations.
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   -         Urine grew Pseudomonas; Ceftazidime 2gm q12h IV given for
   10days ([**2174-9-10**] to [**2174-9-18**]).
   -         Sputum grew MSSA; ceftax
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 fever, UOP seems to have improved with
   decreased temp
   -         Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed, monitor UOP
   -         Finishing Abx [**9-18**], has been concern that temps are due to
   drugs, will monitor off abx.  CXR also concerning for infection,  but
   will f/u cx before starting antibiotics.
   -         If hypotensive, will bolus with NS
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH NL now
   - Continue to monitor ABGs.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   -          Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with coreg at 25mg
   -          cards suggested starting heparin, held at first given
   oozing of PEG. Given 5% risk of event per year and limit expected pt
   lifespan, do not feel strongly on starting heparin
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   - When UOP is good take U and S electrolytes and OSMs.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible
   -          Free water flushes to 300 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Changed fluids to D5W and put meds in this fluid.
   #[**Name (NI) 4087**] Pt previously had high residuals, residuals overnight were <10

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure (ejection fraction of 10%), admitted for respiratory distress. He has had prolonged intubation and tracheostomy since September 3rd. The patient is dependent on cardiac output for renal function and renal function is sensitive to changes in perfusion. He has been difficult to wean from the ventilator. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, acute on chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, and coagulopathy. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 103.1°F, blood pressure of 103/55 mmHg, heart rate of 112 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. The urine culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The sputum culture grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4964 mL, output of 1700 mL, and a positive balance of 2644 mL. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening heart failure, worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and infections.

   CXR:
   The current study is extremely limited due to underpenetration and
   motion
   artifacts. Within the limitation of the study, the tracheostomy tube is
   noted
   with the tip at the midline, 5 cm above the carina. Most likely
   bilateral
   hilar enlargement is present as well as right lower lobe opacity. Since
   this
   exam is extremely limited, further repeated study is highly
   recommended.

   after being found down in his home. He has had a prolonged intubation,
   now with trach since [**9-3**]. He is dependent on cardiac output for
   renal function and renal function is exquisitely sensitive to changes
   in perfusion. He has been continued to be difficult to wean from the
   ventilator.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]). Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, as is severe
   CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations intermittently, with
   alkalemic blood gases. Most recent blood gas is reassuring at
   7.39/31/181 on the ventilator. CXR from today is limited by motion
   artifact, but yesterday
s was concerning for new RLL infiltrate.
   - Resend sputum today.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - F/u gram stains and cxs.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx (ceftazidime and nafcillin) were given for pos MSSA and E. coli
   sputum cx. Finished yesterday. However due to concern for RLL
   infiltrate, in setting of unusually high fever and rising WBC, should
   talk to ID about restarting previous antibiotics versus starting vanc
   and zosyn.
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entirely, extended MICU course.
   However, recent spike to 103.1 is higher than previous fevers to 100s
   and 101s. WBC also up to 20.3 today, from 17.4 yesterday.
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 and cooling blanket for fever.
   -          Resend sputum.
   -          Repeat CXR.
   -          Send stool for c. diff.
   -          Send swab from surrounding PEG for gram stain and cx.
   -          Talk to ID about their antibiotic recommendations, as above.
   -          No need to change lines now, but consider pending blood cx
   results.
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   - Talk to ID about antibiotics.
   -         Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed.
   - Continue to monitor UOP.
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent. Up to 170s yesterday, likely
   exacerbated by fever.
   -          Carvedilol 25mg once daily.
   -          Continue to monitor and use fluid boluses.
   -          Consider loading with amiodarone if VT becomes sustained or
   leads to hemodynamic instability.
   -          Continue to treat fever and other comorbidities.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with coreg at 25mg.
   -          Continue coumadin 5mg Qdaily (home dose, which pt has been
   back on since [**9-17**]).
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - Carvedilol 25mg QD
   - restarted coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose) [**2174-9-17**]
   - Following INR, which is now 1.3.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.0
   today. Renal signed off yesterday.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   - f/u U and S electrolytes and osms.
   #COAGULOPATHY: Now resolved but possible sources included hepatic and
   nutritional. Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well. Vit K 10mg QD for
   3 days last dose ([**9-15**]). Now coumadinized, with INR = 1.3.
   - Continue to follow.
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH NL now.
   - Continue to monitor ABGs.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          Free water flushes decreased to 200 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a
   problem.  Pt [**Name2 (NI) 1824**] well.
   - continue to monitor stools.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with respiratory distress after being found down at home. He has had prolonged intubation and tracheostomy since September 3rd. The patient is dependent on cardiac output for renal function, and his renal function is sensitive to changes in perfusion. He has been difficult to wean from the ventilator.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). Pt's failure likely multifactorial. Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, as is severe CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations intermittently, with alkalemic blood gases.
2. Heart failure (CHF), systolic, acute on chronic. Pt with severe cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB).
4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF).
5. Coagulopathy: Now resolved but possible sources included hepatic and nutritional.
6. Metabolic alkalosis.
7. Hypernatremia.
8. Concern for ileus.

- Communication: Girlfriend allegedly to visit tomorrow ([**9-20**])
- Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
- Disposition: ICU

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has multi-lobar pneumonia contributing to respiratory failure.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's severe CHF (EF 10%) is exacerbating respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile for an extended period, indicating a possible ongoing infection.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been difficult to wean from the ventilator, increasing the risk of VAP.
5. PEG tube infection: The patient's fever and concern for PEG tube infection may indicate a localized infection.
6. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is dependent on cardiac output and may deteriorate further.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient had a resolved coagulopathy but may be at risk for recurrence.

   artifacts. Within the limitation of the study, the tracheostomy tube is
   noted
   with the tip at the midline, 5 cm above the carina. Most likely
   bilateral
   hilar enlargement is present as well as right lower lobe opacity. Since
   this
   exam is extremely limited, further repeated study is highly
   recommended.

   - Abx (ceftazidime and nafcillin) were given for pos MSSA and E. coli
   sputum cx. Finished yesterday. However due to concern for RLL
   infiltrate, in setting of unusually high fever and rising WBC, should
   talk to ID about restarting previous antibiotics versus starting vanc
   and zosyn.
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entirely, extended MICU course.
   However, recent spike to 103.1 is higher than previous fevers to 100s
   and 101s. WBC also up to 20.3 today, from 17.4 yesterday.

   -          Send swab from surrounding PEG for gram stain and cx.
   -          Talk to ID about their antibiotic recommendations, as above.
   -          No need to change lines now, but consider pending blood cx
   results.
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   - Talk to ID about antibiotics.
   -         Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed.
   - Continue to monitor UOP.
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent. Up to 170s yesterday, likely
   exacerbated by fever.
   -          Carvedilol 25mg once daily.
   -          Continue to monitor and use fluid boluses.
   -          Consider loading with amiodarone if VT becomes sustained or
   leads to hemodynamic instability.
   -          Continue to treat fever and other comorbidities.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with coreg at 25mg.
   -          Continue coumadin 5mg Qdaily (home dose, which pt has been
   back on since [**9-17**]).
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - Carvedilol 25mg QD
   - restarted coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose) [**2174-9-17**]
   - Following INR, which is now 1.3.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.0
   today. Renal signed off yesterday.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   - f/u U and S electrolytes and osms.
   #COAGULOPATHY: Now resolved but possible sources included hepatic and
   nutritional. Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well. Vit K 10mg QD for
   3 days last dose ([**9-15**]). Now coumadinized, with INR = 1.3.
   - Continue to follow.
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH NL now.
   - Continue to monitor ABGs.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          Free water flushes decreased to 200 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a
   problem.  Pt [**Name2 (NI) 1824**] well.
   - continue to monitor stools.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure (CHF), currently admitted for respiratory distress. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to prolonged respiratory failure. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place since September 3rd and is dependent on cardiac output for renal function.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Fever with a recent spike to 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit
- Elevated white blood cell count of 20.3 thousand cells/mm³
- Hypotension with a low blood pressure of 82/46 mmHg
- Tachycardia with intermittent ventricular tachycardia up to 170 beats per minute
- Bilateral hilar enlargement and right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, suggesting possible pneumonia
- Multilobar pneumonia contributing to respiratory failure
- Severe CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of only 10%
- Acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL
- Hypernatremia due to urea diuresis when glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is possible
- Metabolic alkalosis likely caused by large volume diuresis
- Coagulopathy that has resolved with the use of desmopressin (DDAVP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
- Ileus concerns that have improved with conservative management
- Systolic blood pressure of 102 mmHg
- Heart rate of 112 beats per minute
- Respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator
- Atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 170 beats per minute

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and hypotension suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's severe CHF and low cardiac output may result in cardiogenic shock.
3. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's history of MI and ongoing tachycardia increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia.
4. Pneumonia: The bilateral hilar enlargement and right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray indicate possible pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory distress.
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and multilobar pneumonia could progress to ARDS.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and acute renal failure indicate impaired renal function, which may worsen if not managed appropriately.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels due to urea diuresis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with severe dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 10%), chronic respiratory failure, tracheostomy thought to be secondary to heart failure and multilobar pneumonia. The patient was tachycardic with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) during rounds yesterday and received IV fluids, which responded well. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on carvedilol and warfarin.

24-hour events include a positive blood culture from arterial line, central line, urine, and sputum. The patient had an EKG, and fever was documented at 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient received antibiotics (ceftazidime and nafcillin) as per the culture results.

Infusions include fentanyl, midazolam, and famotidine. Other medications include regular insulin, colace, chlorhexidine, ASA, atrovent, versed, levoxyl, Pepcid, carvedilol, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate 142 bpm (with atrial fibrillation), blood pressure 113/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 45 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on the ventilator.

   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) who was admitted for respiratory distress
   after being found down in his home. He has had a prolonged intubation,
   now with trach since [**9-3**]. He is dependent on cardiac output for
   renal function and renal function is exquisitely sensitive to changes
   in perfusion. He has been continued to be difficult to wean from the
   ventilator.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]). Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, as is severe
   CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations intermittently, with
   alkalemic blood gases. Most recent blood gas is reassuring at
   7.39/31/181 on the ventilator. CXR from today is limited by motion
   artifact, but yesterday
s was concerning for new RLL infiltrate. Sputum
   cultures pending but previous grew MSSA and E.coli.
   - F/u gram stains and cxs.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx (ceftazidime and nafcillin) were given for pos MSSA and E. coli
   sputum cx. However due to concern for RLL infiltrate, in setting of
   unusually high fever and rising WBC, started  vanc and zosyn [**2174-9-19**].
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entire, extended MICU course.
   However, recently been spiking to 103s and 104s which  is higher than
   previous fevers to 100s and 101s. WBC also up over last few days. New
   RLL infiltrate being treated with Vanc/zosyn. Concern for abscess in
   abdomen/pelvis as draining purulent discharge from PEG site.
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 and cooling blanket for fever.
   -          Sent stool for c. diff.
   -                Sent swab from surrounding PEG for gram stain and cx.
   -                F/u CT chest/Abd/pelvis today
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   -         Keep CVPs in ~[**1-17**] with fluid as needed.
   - Continue to monitor UOP. Increases with decreased HR and decreased
   fever so likely treating the fever will help the UOP.
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent. Up to 170s yesterday, likely
   exacerbated by fever.
   -          Carvedilol 25mg twice daily. Does help tachycardia
   transiently but in setting of high fevers does not sustain effect.
   -          Continue to monitor and use fluid boluses.
   -          Consider loading with amiodarone if VT becomes sustained or
   leads to hemodynamic instability.
   -          Continue to treat fever and other comorbidities.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with coreg at 25mg.
   -          Continue coumadin 5mg Qdaily (home dose, which pt has been
   back on since [**9-17**]).
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - Carvedilol 25mg QD
   - restarted coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose) [**2174-9-17**]
   - Following INR, which is now 1.3. Will inc coumadin dose today to goal
   inr [**3-6**].
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.3
   today. Renal signed off yesterday but now Cr slightly increased at 1.3.
   did receive 400mg motrin last night for fever which may be contributing
   but more likely he is not perfusing his kidneys with increasingly high
   fevers and tachycardia keeping his CO low.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   - f/u U and S electrolytes and osms.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          Free water flushes decreased to 200 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a
   problem.  Pt [**Name2 (NI) 1824**] well.
   - continue to monitor stools.

The patient has been intubated and tracheostomized since September 3rd. He is dependent on cardiac output for renal function, which is sensitive to changes in perfusion. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure due to multi-lobar pneumonia and severe CHF. 

The patient's current condition includes fever, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and new right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate on chest X-ray. The fever has been spiking to 103-104 degrees Fahrenheit, higher than previous temperatures in the range of 100-101 degrees Fahrenheit. The WBC count has also been rising over the last few days. 

There is concern for an abscess in the abdomen/pelvis as the patient is draining purulent discharge from the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site. The patient's blood cultures were sent for gram stain and culture, and a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was ordered for today.

The patient is in shock, likely a combination of septic and cardiogenic shock. Despite adequate urine output (UOP), the patient remains hypotensive, with a low of 82/46 mmHg. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) who was admitted for respiratory distress
   after being found down in his home. He has had a prolonged intubation,
   now with trach since [**9-3**]. He is dependent on cardiac output for
   renal function and renal function is exquisitely sensitive to changes
   in perfusion. He has been continued to be difficult to wean from the
   ventilator.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]). Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, but likely now
   mostly because of severe CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations
   intermittently, with alkalemic blood gases.CXR today less concerning
   for RLL infiltrate
 may have been episode of aspiration. Sputum
   cultures pending but previous grew MSSA and E.coli.
   - F/u gram stains and cxs.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx (ceftazidime and nafcillin) were given for pos MSSA and E. coli
   sputum cx. However due to concern for RLL infiltrate, in setting of
   unusually high fever and rising WBC, started  vanc and zosyn [**2174-9-19**].
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entire, extended MICU course.
   However, recently been spiking to 103s and 104s which is higher than
   previous fevers to 100s and 101s. WBC also up over last few days. New
   RLL infiltrate being treated with Vanc/zosyn. Concern for abscess in
   abdomen/pelvis as draining purulent discharge from PEG site. D/C
   fentanyl patch as can have elevated fentanyl levels in setting of fever
   if on patch. Also tried to wean off fentanyl as 1-10% of patients can
   develop fever on this drug.  Still concern for infectious etiology,
   however, so patient will be pan-CT
d today to look for abscess.
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 and cooling blanket for fever.
   -          Sent stool for c. diff.
   -                Sent swab from surrounding PEG for gram stain and cx.
   -                F/u CT chest/Abd/pelvis today
   -                Will check TSH as pt on levothyroxine and TSH not
   checked recently.
   -                Will also check LFTs to r/o hepatitis or gall bladder
   disease as cause for fevers.
   -                Will replace CVL and pull/culture old line
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   -         Keep CVPs in ~[**1-17**] with fluid as needed.
   - Continue to monitor UOP. Increases with decreased HR and decreased
   fever so likely treating the fever will help the UOP.
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent. Up to 170s yesterday, likely
   exacerbated by fever.
   -          Carvedilol 25mg twice daily. Does help tachycardia
   transiently but in setting of high fevers does not sustain effect.
   -          Continue to monitor and use fluid boluses.
   -          Consider loading with amiodarone if VT becomes sustained or
   leads to hemodynamic instability.
   -          Continue to treat fever and other comorbidities.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with coreg at 25mg.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - Carvedilol 25mg QD
   - restarted coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose) [**2174-9-17**] however since may
   need central line replaced today in order to culture the old one will
   not give dose tonight and will transfer to heparin instead.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.3
   today. Renal signed off yesterday but now Cr slightly increased at 1.3.
   did receive 400mg motrin last night for fever which may be contributing
   but more likely he is not perfusing his kidneys with increasingly high
   fevers and tachycardia keeping his CO low.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          Free water flushes decreased to 200 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a
   problem.  Pt [**Name2 (NI) 1824**] well.
   - continue to monitor stools.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who has been admitted for respiratory distress. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely multifactorial in origin. Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, but severe CHF with an ejection fraction of 10% is also a significant factor. There may have been an episode of aspiration, and sputum cultures are pending. The patient is being treated with various antibiotics, including Vanc and Zosyn.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock and cardiogenic shock. Despite good urine output, the patient remains hypotensive (with a low of 82/46). Fever continues, and the patient is being managed with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.

3. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has intermittent ventricular tachycardia, which can be exacerbated by fever. The patient is being treated with carvedilol to help control the tachycardia.

4. Heart Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic heart failure due to severe cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 10%. The patient is on coreg at 25 mg.

   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) who was admitted for respiratory distress
   after being found down in his home. He has had a prolonged intubation,
   now with trach since [**9-3**]. He is dependent on cardiac output for
   renal function and renal function is exquisitely sensitive to changes
   in perfusion. He has been continued to be difficult to wean from the
   ventilator.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]). Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, as is severe
   CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations intermittently, with
   alkalemic blood gases. Most recent blood gas is reassuring at
   7.39/31/181 on the ventilator. CXR from today is limited by motion
   artifact, but yesterday
s was concerning for new RLL infiltrate.
   - Resend sputum today.
   - Repeat CXR.
   - F/u gram stains and cxs.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx (ceftazidime and nafcillin) were given for pos MSSA and E. coli
   sputum cx. Finished yesterday. However due to concern for RLL
   infiltrate, in setting of unusually high fever and rising WBC, should
   talk to ID about restarting previous antibiotics versus starting vanc
   and zosyn.
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entirely, extended MICU course.
   However, recent spike to 103.1 is higher than previous fevers to 100s
   and 101s. WBC also up to 20.3 today, from 17.4 yesterday.
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 and cooling blanket for fever.
   -          Resend sputum.
   -          Repeat CXR.
   -          Send stool for c. diff.
   -          Send swab from surrounding PEG for gram stain and cx.
   -          Talk to ID about their antibiotic recommendations, as above.
   -          No need to change lines now, but consider pending blood cx
   results.
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   - Talk to ID about antibiotics.
   -         Keep CVPs in 20s with fluid as needed.
   - Continue to monitor UOP.
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent. Up to 170s yesterday, likely
   exacerbated by fever.
   -          Carvedilol 25mg once daily.
   -          Continue to monitor and use fluid boluses.
   -          Consider loading with amiodarone if VT becomes sustained or
   leads to hemodynamic instability.
   -          Continue to treat fever and other comorbidities.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with coreg at 25mg.
   -          Continue coumadin 5mg Qdaily (home dose, which pt has been
   back on since [**9-17**]).
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - Carvedilol 25mg QD
   - restarted coumadin at 5mg QD (home dose) [**2174-9-17**]
   - Following INR, which is now 1.3.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.0
   today. Renal signed off yesterday.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - No longer needs meds renally dosed.
   - Continue to monitor Cr, BUN, UOP.
   - f/u U and S electrolytes and osms.
   #COAGULOPATHY: Now resolved but possible sources included hepatic and
   nutritional. Got DDAVP [**2174-9-12**] and 1unit FFP as well. Vit K 10mg QD for
   3 days last dose ([**9-15**]). Now coumadinized, with INR = 1.3.
   - Continue to follow.
   #Metabolic Alkalosis- Likely [**3-5**] large volume diuresis; pH NL now.
   - Continue to monitor ABGs.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          Free water flushes decreased to 200 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a
   problem.  Pt [**Name2 (NI) 1824**] well.
   - continue to monitor stools.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Urine output
   adequate.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   Continued high fevers, unclear source.  Will scan chest and abd, in
   effort to look for abscess.  If negative
   will change central line. Continue broad spectrum antibiotics.
   Tachycardia:  On carvedilol, but still rapid likely due to fevers.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with severe chronic mesenteric ischemia (CM) and respiratory failure. The patient has been unresponsive to ventilatory support and is unable to be weaned off the ventilator. The patient also has acute renal failure, with adequate urine output. There are signs of heart failure, specifically acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure. The patient has been experiencing high fevers, with an unclear source. Imaging results show no clear infiltrate on the chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's inability to be weaned off the ventilator, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections.

2. Renal Complications: Acute renal failure is present, and further deterioration of renal function can occur if proper management and monitoring are not implemented.

3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's heart failure status increases the risk of cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or worsening heart function.

4. Infection-related Complications: The high fevers indicate an ongoing infection. If the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly, it can lead to sepsis or septic shock.

5. Gastrointestinal Complications: Chronic mesenteric ischemia can lead to intestinal ischemia or infarction if not managed appropriately.

6. Thromboembolic Complications: Due"

      Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
CT head:
   Preliminary Report !! PFI !!
   No hemorrhage or abnormal focus of enhancement. Note is made of
   ill-defined
   low density in the left frontal parasagittal cortex which is a
   nonspecific
   finding, however, could represent an age-indeterminate infarct and thus
   further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
   Preliminary Report !! PFI !!
   1. No evidence of definitive abscess.
   2. Pneumomediastinum and intraperitoneal free air, resolved.
   3. Mildly dilated loops of fluid-filled large bowel consistent with
   possible
   infectious diarrheal disease such as C. difficile colitis.
   4. Splenic infarctions.
   5. Pathologic gynecomastia.
Transthoracic echo:
   Conclusions
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is dilated. The
   estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is severely
   dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20
   %). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
   contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
   severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Severe pulmonic
   regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation
   velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-8-26**], there is
   no definite change. (Tricuspid regurgitation was underestimated in the
   prior report).
   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) who was admitted for respiratory distress
   after being found down in his home. He has had a prolonged intubation,
   now with trach since [**9-3**]. He is dependent on cardiac output for
   renal function and renal function is exquisitely sensitive to changes
   in perfusion. He has continued to have high fevers despite aggressive
   cooling. At this time his family has decided to not escalate care.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]). Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, but likely now
   mostly because of severe CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations
   intermittently, with alkalemic blood gases. Sputum cultures pending but
   previous grew MSSA and E.coli. At this time deeply sedated and
   breathing on a respirator.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx now D/Ced. Believed to be possible source of fever.
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entire, extended MICU course.
   However, recently been spiking to 103s and 104s which is higher than
   previous fevers to 100s and 101s. WBC also up over last few days. New
   RLL infiltrate being treated with Vanc/zosyn. Concern for abscess in
   abdomen/pelvis as draining purulent discharge from PEG site. D/C
   fentanyl patch as can have elevated fentanyl levels in setting of fever
   if on patch. Also tried to wean off fentanyl as 1-10% of patients can
   develop fever on this drug.  Still concern for infectious etiology,
   however, so patient will be pan-CT
d today to look for abscess. CTs
   were negative, and ID recommended D/Cing all Abx. Fevers have continued
   in spite of aggressive cooling.
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 and cooling blanket and arctic sun ON for
   fever without good effect. Pt achieved temp of almost 107 with this
   regimen.
   -         Replaced CVL and pulled/cultured old line.
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   - CVPs have been elevated to 20 in spite of low SBP even on maximum
   doses of pressors.
   - Uo/p dropped to zero for several hours, but has since climbed back to
   40mL/hr.
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent, likely exacerbated by fever.
   Carvedilol did not seem to have a major effect on tachycardia ON.
   - D/c carvedilol, as it will be ineffectual in setting of pressor.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          D/c carvedilol, as it will be ineffectual in setting of
   pressor.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - D/c carvedilol, as it will be ineffectual in setting of pressor.
   - Holding anticoagulation. Not escalating care.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.3
   today. Renal signed off yesterday but now Cr slightly increased at 1.3.
   did receive 400mg motrin last night for fever which may be contributing
   but more likely he is not perfusing his kidneys with increasingly high
   fevers and tachycardia keeping his CO low.
   - Holding lasix  as above.
   - Uop decreased to zero, but now climbing.
   - Receiving bicarb in fluids because of acidosis and low bicarb.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          D/c free water flushes.
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a
   problem.  Pt [**Name2 (NI) 1824**] well.
   - First C. diff neg.
   - Continue to monitor stools.
   - Continue flagyl.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted for respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and on a respirator due to severe CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of only 10%. 

The patient has been febrile for his entire MICU course, with recent spikes to 103-104 degrees Fahrenheit. There is a new right lower lobe infiltrate being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is also showing signs of septic shock and cardiogenic shock, with persistent hypotension despite maximum doses of pressors and elevated central venous pressures (CVPs).

The patient's renal function is critically dependent on cardiac output, and there are concerns about acute renal failure (ARF) due to inadequate perfusion. The patient's serum creatinine is slightly elevated at 1.3 mg/dL, and there is hypernatremia likely related to urea diuresis when GFR is possible.

There are concerns about possible ileus, as previously the patient had high residuals, but this is no longer a problem. The patient has tested negative for Clostridium difficile toxin A & B.

The patient's family has decided not to escalate care beyond the current measures. The patient's code status"

CT head:
   Preliminary Report !! PFI !!
   No hemorrhage or abnormal focus of enhancement. Note is made of
   ill-defined
   low density in the left frontal parasagittal cortex which is a

   1. No evidence of definitive abscess.
   2. Pneumomediastinum and intraperitoneal free air, resolved.
   3. Mildly dilated loops of fluid-filled large bowel consistent with

   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) who was admitted for respiratory distress
   after being found down in his home. He has had a prolonged intubation,
   now with trach since [**9-3**]. He is dependent on cardiac output for
   renal function and renal function is exquisitely sensitive to changes
   in perfusion. He has continued to have high fevers despite aggressive
   cooling. At this time his family has decided to not escalate care.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]). Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, but likely now
   mostly because of severe CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations
   intermittently, with alkalemic blood gases. Sputum cultures pending but
   previous grew MSSA and E.coli. At this time deeply sedated and
   breathing on a respirator.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx now D/Ced. Believed to be possible source of fever.
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entire, extended MICU course.
   However, recently been spiking to 103s and 104s which is higher than
   previous fevers to 100s and 101s. WBC also up over last few days. New
   RLL infiltrate being treated with Vanc/zosyn. Concern for abscess in
   abdomen/pelvis as draining purulent discharge from PEG site. D/C
   fentanyl patch as can have elevated fentanyl levels in setting of fever
   if on patch. Also tried to wean off fentanyl as 1-10% of patients can
   develop fever on this drug.  Still concern for infectious etiology,
   however, so patient will be pan-CT
d today to look for abscess. CTs
   were negative, and ID recommended D/Cing all Abx. Fevers have continued
   in spite of aggressive cooling.
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 and cooling blanket and arctic sun ON for
   fever without good effect. Pt achieved temp of almost 107 with this
   regimen.
   -         Replaced CVL and pulled/cultured old line.
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   - CVPs have been elevated to 20 in spite of low SBP even on maximum
   doses of pressors.
   - Uo/p dropped to zero for several hours, but has since climbed back to
   40mL/hr.
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent, likely exacerbated by fever.
   -          Carvedilol 25mg twice daily. Did not seem to have a major
   effect on tachycardia ON.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with carvidilol at 25mg.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - Carvedilol 25mg QD
   - Holding anticoagulation. Not escalating care.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.3
   today. Renal signed off yesterday but now Cr slightly increased at 1.3.
   did receive 400mg motrin last night for fever which may be contributing
   but more likely he is not perfusing his kidneys with increasingly high
   fevers and tachycardia keeping his CO low.
   - Holding lasix  as above.
   - Uop decreased to zero, but now climbing.
   - Receiving bicarb in fluids because of acidosis and low bicarb.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          Free water flushes decreased to 200 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a
   problem.  Pt [**Name2 (NI) 1824**] well.
   - First C. diff neg.
   - Continue to monitor stools.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) presenting with respiratory distress. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to his inability to maintain adequate oxygenation. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors including multi-lobar pneumonia, severe CHF with an ejection fraction of 10%, septic shock, and acute renal failure.

The patient has been febrile for most of his ICU stay, with recent spikes in temperature to 103-104 degrees Fahrenheit. His white blood cell count has also increased over the past few days. A new right lower lobe infiltrate has been identified, and he is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. There is concern for an abscess in the abdomen/pelvis, as he is draining purulent discharge from his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site. Despite aggressive cooling measures, including the use of a cooling blanket and Arctic Sun protocol, the patient's fever persists.

The patient's renal function is critically dependent on cardiac output, and there is evidence of renal dysfunction, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. He has been receiving bicarbonate in his fluids to address metabolic acidosis.

The patient is experiencing hypotension and requires maximum doses of pressors to maintain blood pressure. His urine output has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) who was admitted for respiratory distress
   after being found down in his home. He has had a prolonged intubation,
   now with trach since [**9-3**]. He is dependent on cardiac output for
   renal function and renal function is exquisitely sensitive to changes
   in perfusion. He has continued to have high fevers despite aggressive
   cooling. At this time his family has decided to not escalate care.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]). Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, but likely now
   mostly because of severe CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations
   intermittently, with alkalemic blood gases. Sputum cultures pending but
   previous grew MSSA and E.coli. At this time deeply sedated and
   breathing on a respirator.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx now D/Ced. Believed to be possible source of fever.
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entire, extended MICU course.
   However, recently been spiking to 103s and 104s which is higher than
   previous fevers to 100s and 101s. WBC also up over last few days. New
   RLL infiltrate being treated with Vanc/zosyn. Concern for abscess in
   abdomen/pelvis as draining purulent discharge from PEG site. D/C
   fentanyl patch as can have elevated fentanyl levels in setting of fever
   if on patch. Also tried to wean off fentanyl as 1-10% of patients can
   develop fever on this drug.  Still concern for infectious etiology,
   however, so patient will be pan-CT
d today to look for abscess. CTs
   were negative, and ID recommended D/Cing all Abx. Fevers have continued
   in spite of aggressive cooling.
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 and cooling blanket and arctic sun ON for
   fever without good effect. Pt achieved temp of almost 107 with this
   regimen.
   -         Replaced CVL and pulled/cultured old line.
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   -  CVPs have been elevated to 20 in spite of low SBP even on maximum
   doses of pressors.
   - Uo/p dropped to zero for several hours, but has since climbed
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent, likely exacerbated by fever.
   -          Carvedilol 25mg twice daily. Did not seem to have a major
   effect on tachycardia ON.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with carvidilol at 25mg.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - Carvedilol 25mg QD
   - Holding anticoagulation. Not escalating care.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.3
   today. Renal signed off yesterday but now Cr slightly increased at 1.3.
   did receive 400mg motrin last night for fever which may be contributing
   but more likely he is not perfusing his kidneys with increasingly high
   fevers and tachycardia keeping his CO low.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - Uop decreased to zero, but now climbing.
   - Receiving bicarb in fluids because of acidosis and low bicarb.
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          Free water flushes decreased to 200 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a
   problem.  Pt [**Name2 (NI) 1824**] well.
   - Continue to monitor stools.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male who has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) with congestive heart failure (CHF) and is currently admitted for respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs indicate fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The blood gases show an alkalemic pH and high PaCO2. The arterial blood gas analysis also shows a low oxygen level.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The urine dipstick analysis indicates the presence of protein, blood, and nitrites.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, septic shock, cardiogenic shock, acute heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, renal failure, hypernatremia, and concern for ileus.

The patient's condition is described as critical, with ongoing fevers despite aggressive cooling measures. The family has decided not to escalate care beyond current measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of cardiac function leading to cardiogenic shock, progression of renal failure, development of severe infections, and complications related to the ileus."

   Assessment and Plan
   50M s/p MI with CHF (EF 10%) who was admitted for respiratory distress
   after being found down in his home. He has had a prolonged intubation,
   now with trach since [**9-3**]. He is dependent on cardiac output for
   renal function and renal function is exquisitely sensitive to changes
   in perfusion. He has continued to have high fevers despite aggressive
   cooling. At this time his family has decided to not escalate care.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]). Pts failure likely
   multifactorial.  Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, but likely now
   mostly because of severe CHF (EF 10%). Has [**Last Name (un) 1464**]-[**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations
   intermittently, with alkalemic blood gases. Sputum cultures pending but
   previous grew MSSA and E.coli. At this time deeply sedated and
   breathing on a respirator.
   - F/u gram stains and cxs.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx now D/Ced. Believed to be possible source of fever.
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entire, extended MICU course.
   However, recently been spiking to 103s and 104s which is higher than
   previous fevers to 100s and 101s. WBC also up over last few days. New
   RLL infiltrate being treated with Vanc/zosyn. Concern for abscess in
   abdomen/pelvis as draining purulent discharge from PEG site. D/C
   fentanyl patch as can have elevated fentanyl levels in setting of fever
   if on patch. Also tried to wean off fentanyl as 1-10% of patients can
   develop fever on this drug.  Still concern for infectious etiology,
   however, so patient will be pan-CT
d today to look for abscess. CTs
   were negative, and ID recommended D/Cing all Abx. Fevers have continued
   in spite of aggressive cooling.
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 and cooling blanket and arctic sun ON for
   fever without good effect. Pt achieved temp of almost 107 with this
   regimen.
   -         Replaced CVL and pulled/cultured old line
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   -  CVPs have been elevated to 20 inspite of low SBP even on maximum
   doses of pressors.
   - Uo/p has dropped to zero
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent, likely exacerbated by fever.
   -          Carvedilol 25mg twice daily. Did not seem to have a major
   effect on tachycardia ON
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with carvidilol at 25mg.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - Carvedilol 25mg QD
   - Holding anticoagulation. Not escalating care.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.3
   today. Renal signed off yesterday but now Cr slightly increased at 1.3.
   did receive 400mg motrin last night for fever which may be contributing
   but more likely he is not perfusing his kidneys with increasingly high
   fevers and tachycardia keeping his CO low.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - Uop now zero
   - Receiving bicarb in fluids
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          Free water flushes decreased to 200 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a
   problem.  Pt [**Name2 (NI) 1824**] well.
   - continue to monitor stools.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure (CHF) admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation since September 3rd. The patient's family has decided not to escalate care beyond current measures.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial. Multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, but severe CHF with an ejection fraction of 10% is also a significant factor. The patient has intermittent episodes of increased respiratory rate, known as [**Doctor Last Name 1465**] respirations, and has alkalemic blood gases.
- Fever: The patient has been febrile for his entire extended MICU course. Recently, he has been experiencing higher fevers up to 103-104 degrees Fahrenheit. His white blood cell count is elevated, indicating possible infection. A new right lower lobe infiltrate has developed, and he is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. There is concern for an abscess in the abdomen/pelvis, as he is draining purulent discharge from his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site. The fentanyl patch has been discontinued due to the possibility of elevated fentanyl levels in the setting of fever.

   intermittently, with alkalemic blood gases. Sputum cultures pending but
   previous grew MSSA and E.coli. At this time deeply sedated and
   breathing on a respirator.
   - F/u gram stains and cxs.
   - Continue atrovent nebs prn.
   - Abx now D/Ced. Believed to be possible source of fever.
   - Keep HOB elevated to decrease effects of obesity on ventilation.
   # Fever: Has been febrile for his entire, extended MICU course.
   However, recently been spiking to 103s and 104s which is higher than
   previous fevers to 100s and 101s. WBC also up over last few days. New
   RLL infiltrate being treated with Vanc/zosyn. Concern for abscess in
   abdomen/pelvis as draining purulent discharge from PEG site. D/C
   fentanyl patch as can have elevated fentanyl levels in setting of fever
   if on patch. Also tried to wean off fentanyl as 1-10% of patients can
   develop fever on this drug.  Still concern for infectious etiology,
   however, so patient will be pan-CT
d today to look for abscess. CTs
   were negative, and ID recommended D/Cing all Abx. Fevers have continued
   in spite of aggressive cooling.
   -         Tylenol 650 q6 and cooling blanket and arctic sun ON for
   fever without good effect. Pt achieved temp of almost 107 with this
   regimen.
   -         Replaced CVL and pulled/cultured old line
    # Shock:  Likely a combination of septic shock and cardiogenic shock.
   UOP has been good (consistently above 30cc/hr) but hypotension
   continues (to low of 82/46). Pt is febrile, as above.
   -  CVPs have been elevated to 20 inspite of low SBP even on maximum
   doses of pressors.
   - Uo/p has dropped to zero
Ventricular tachycardia: Intermittent, likely exacerbated by fever.
   -          Carvedilol 25mg twice daily. Did not seem to have a major
   effect on tachycardia ON
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC. Pt with severe
   cardiomyopathy and EF of only 10%.
   -          Continue with carvidilol at 25mg.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB).
   - Carvedilol 25mg QD
   - Holding anticoagulation. Not escalating care.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)- After discussions
   with renal is seems that his cardiac output is only barely enough to
   maintain GFR. When his CO is higher, he can filter the burden of his
   high levels of urea serves as a potent diuretic for free water. As a
   result, when he is hymodynamically strong enough to have a GFR, he
   rapidly diureses water and urea resulting in hypernatremia. Cr 1.3
   today. Renal signed off yesterday but now Cr slightly increased at 1.3.
   did receive 400mg motrin last night for fever which may be contributing
   but more likely he is not perfusing his kidneys with increasingly high
   fevers and tachycardia keeping his CO low.
   - Holding lasix  as above
   - Uop now zero
   - Receiving bicarb in fluids
   # Hypernatremia: As above, related to urea diuresis when GFR is
   possible. Na concentration is wnl range now.
   -          Free water flushes decreased to 200 mL q 4 hrs.
   -          Continue to put meds in D5W fluid.
   # Concern for ileus: Pt previously had high residuals; no longer a

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, who presented with respiratory distress. He has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation since September 3rd. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. He has had persistent fevers despite aggressive cooling measures and has developed a multi-lobar pneumonia with positive cultures for MSSA and E. coli. The patient's family has decided not to escalate care beyond current measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and multi-lobar pneumonia contributing to his respiratory distress.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has signs of renal dysfunction, including elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). The AKI may be due to septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or nephrotoxic drugs.

3. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, such as elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes. This could be related to sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, or drug-induced liver injury.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has low platelet count and prolonged clotting times,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical condition can be summarized as follows:

The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of chronic conditions including heart failure, chronic renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient's current acute issues include acute renal failure, acute on chronic heart failure, fever with an unclear etiology, and hypernatremia.

The patient's vital signs show a high temperature (106.9 degrees Celsius), increased heart rate (121 bpm), low blood pressure (65/44 mmHg), and an abnormal respiratory rate (18 breaths per minute). The patient's oxygen saturation is within normal range at 97%. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (21.8 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin levels (11.4 g/dL), and elevated creatinine levels (1.0-2.0 mg/dL) indicating renal dysfunction. The patient also has elevated blood glucose levels (168-229 mg/dL) and abnormal liver function test results.

The patient's imaging studies show no evidence of hemorrhage on a head CT and no abscess or significant findings on chest, abdominal, and pelvic imaging. The microbiology results indicate a negative C. Difficile test.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's chronic conditions such as heart failure and renal failure. The high fever with an unclear etiology"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have a history of chronic renal failure, heart failure, respiratory failure, and other comorbidities. The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure, acute on chronic heart failure, hyperthermia, hypernatremia, and shock. The patient's fever is of unclear etiology and has been worsening. The patient's overall prognosis is poor, and their family has been informed about the morbid outcome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's high fever, worsening condition, and unclear etiology of fever suggest the possibility of sepsis. It is important to investigate and treat any potential infections promptly.
2. Multiorgan dysfunction: Given the patient's chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, as well as heart failure and respiratory failure, there is a risk of multiorgan dysfunction. Close monitoring and management of vital organ functions are essential.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium levels) which needs to be corrected carefully to avoid complications like seizures or neurological damage.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's low blood pressure and need for vasopressor support indicate hemodynamic instability. Continuous monitoring and adjustments to the patient's fluid and vasopressor therapy are necessary.
5. Complications from mechanical ventilation: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barot"
