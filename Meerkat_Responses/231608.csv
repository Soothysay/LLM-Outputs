   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old male with new-onset acute renal failure, elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient has been transferred from another hospital with a recent bike accident and possible compartment syndrome. There is also a history of cocaine use, which may have contributed to hyperthermia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated CK levels indicate rhabdomyolysis, which is the breakdown of muscle tissue. This can lead to acute kidney injury and further complications if not managed properly.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which can be a consequence of rhabdomyolysis. It is important to monitor renal function closely and seek renal consult.

3. Hepatitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate acute hepatitis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, which could be related to substance abuse history or other factors.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, indicating anemia. It is likely dilutional due to fluid resuscitation. Monitoring hemoglobin and hematocrit levels regularly is essential.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can be due to various causes such as liver disease, drug-related effects"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with new-onset acute renal failure, elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's condition is complicated by rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and acute hepatitis. The patient's pain management is also a concern, as he is experiencing significant diffuse muscle pain. Other issues include anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and polysubstance use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated CK levels and renal failure indicate potential complications related to rhabdomyolysis. This could lead to further deterioration of kidney function and the need for dialysis.
2. Hepatitis: The elevated liver enzymes suggest acute hepatitis. If left untreated, this can progress to liver failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and potential transfusion may be necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: This condition may worsen if not appropriately managed. It could indicate a more serious underlying condition such as sepsis or severe rhabdomyolysis.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels should be corrected carefully to avoid complications like seizures or neurological damage.
6. Pain Management: The patient's severe"

   Assessment and Plan

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RHABDOMYOLYSIS
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 34 y.o. M tranferred from [**Hospital3 2755**] with new
   onset acute renal failure (Cr 11), CK 20,000, and elevated LFTs.
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Pt with elevated CK and elevated MB, ARF. Consider as
   sequaelae of recent bike accident and/or compartment syndrome. Also may
   have contribution from cocaine use with induced hyperthermia. Also on
   differential, consider HIV given his risk factors, septicimia, and
   erlichiosis given that he is from [**Location (un) 1479**] (but parasite smear at OSH
   negative).  HIV neg, parasite smear neg. ehrlichiosis serologies
   pending.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 7**] and CK daily
   - q6 hours serum potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine with
   repletion PRN
   - replete lytes aggressively, except calcium which we are not repleting
   unless symptomatic
   - will discuss with renal  turning down fluids considering worsening
   pulmonary status with 10 + liters since admission and
      minimal urine output
 will likely require dialysis, will also
   discuss possibility of Lasix challenge
   - f/u blood cultures (currently NGTD)
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure/AG metabolic acidosis: likely [**3-16**] rhabdo
   - appreciate renal consult
   - parasite smear negative
   .
   # transaminitis: Liver enzymes elevated. Ddx consists of rhabdomyolosis
   (likely), hepatitis B/C given polysubstance abuse history, severe
   babesiosis. Less likely acetaminophen toxicity and alcoholic hepatitis
   given negative tox screen.
   - treat rhabdo as above
   - HBV and HCV negative
   - trend LFTs: going in the right direction
   - RUQ ultrasound unremarkable
   .
   # Anemia: Hct 33.2 on admit with MCV 89. At OSH, Hct 38. Anemia is
   likely dilutional. am hct 31. will continue to trend and keep active
   T+S.
   - direct bilirubin  and haptoglobin reassuring for hemolytic anemia
   -  fibrinogen, FDP reassuring for DIC
   - send HIV negative
   - parasite smear neg x2 (here and OSH)
   - active T&S
   - monitor Hcts
 drop likely dilutional
   .
   # Pain: pt c/o significant diffuse muscle pain: unclear etiology, would
   not expect rhabdo pain to be so severe. Could also consider opioid
   withdrawal or malingering as pt not tachycardic or hypertensive when
   endorsing [**11-21**] pain.
   -consider pain consult
   -currently getting fentanyl 25 q 1h which is equiv to 2.5 of morphine q
   1h per pharmacy, will convert to MS Contin 45 [**Hospital1 7**] with MSIR 15mg q4 PRN
   breakthrough
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Given history of nausea and vomiting over 5 days,
   hyponatremia may be due to hypovolemia.  Improved to 129 from 120 on
   admission
   - monitor serial Na
   - continue IVF resuscitation
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Ddx consists of liver disease, splenic
   sequestration, drug-related, alcohol use, babesiosis, HIV
   - transfuse plt if decreasing <20K or bleeding
   - monitor plt count
   - f/u erlichia, babesiosis, HIV
   .
   # Polysubstance Use: Pt actively using cocaine, and alcohol.
   - SW consult  and addiction consult
   - MVI, thiamine, folate
   - not [**Doctor Last Name 392**] on ciwa scale
   - will give valium 10mg and see if that helps c anxiety related to pain

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 34-year-old male with a history of recent bike accident, opioid use, and potential cocaine use. He was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient also has severe muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis, and potential complications such as compartment syndrome.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has an elevated serum creatinine level of 11.1 g/dL, indicating impaired kidney function. This could be due to rhabdomyolysis, recent bike accident, or compartment syndrome.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has an elevated CK level of 20,000 U/L, indicating muscle breakdown. This condition can lead to acute kidney injury and other complications.
3. Hyperthermia: The patient may have been exposed to high temperatures, which can contribute to muscle breakdown and kidney damage.
4. HIV and Ehrlichiosis: The patient's risk factors raise suspicion for HIV and ehrlichiosis. However, initial tests were negative for these conditions.
5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, suggesting liver injury. This could be a result of rhabdomyolysis or substance abuse.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, likely due to dilutional effects from fluid resuscitation"
