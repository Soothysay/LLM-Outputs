   component. Pt given 0.5 mg Ativan in the evening with very good effect.
   CT CHEST: Diffuse ground-glass and interlobular septal thickening with
   focal areas of consolidation and a small left pleural
   effusion.Particularly in the presence of extensive but moderate
   mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, increased since earlier studies,
   the appearance suggests an infectious cause; which could include
   atypical causes such as viral or mycoplasmal infection. Other causes
   including superimposed pulmonary edema, diffuse hemorrhage, or ARDS are
   additional differential considerations.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning for ischemic etiology.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. This is unlikely in
   stent thrombosis given negative cardiac enzymes at OSH. Admission EKG
   looks unchanged from baseline. However, EKG on transfer shows diffuse
   TWI, with ST depressions in V2-V6, with ST elevations in aVR.  Patient
   appears slightly volume overloaded, which certainly could be secondary
   to cardiac ischemia.
   - Chest pain yesterday afternoon
 no enzyme leak, ECG unchanged
   likely anxiety component, relieved with Ativan
   - Trend CEs
 continue to be negative
   - Will discuss potential cath today
   - Carvedilol 25mg po bid
   - ASA 325mg mg po daily
   - Plavix 75mg po daily
   - Lisinopril 10mg po daily
   - Atorvastatin 80mg
   - SL nitro PRN CP
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic Congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] currently appears mild fluid
   overloaded. Though JVP difficult to assess given ventilatory support
   and trach collar. LE only have 1+ edema bilaterally. Crackles and
   wheezes bilaterally. Unclear cause of this exacerbation. Differential
   includes ischemia.
   - Lasix 40mg IV daily, Lasix 20 po bid - titrate to UO goal 500cc/day
   - Continue lisinopril, carvedilol
   - Rule out MI as per above
   - Obtain OSH Echo imaging on CD
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Patient apparently has bilateral infiltrates
   per OSH records with multiple sputum cultures + for MRSA with 50,000
   colonies. Differential includes pneumonia vs. fluid overload from CHF
   vs. ARDS.  Given elevated BNP, with clinical signs of mild fluid
   overload, and decreased systolic function seen on echo, it's hard to
   confirm diagnosis of ARDS [**12-31**] chronic aspiration. Pulm consulted and
   believes respiratory failure [**12-31**] fluid overload from HF. Chest CT read
   as likely infectious cause with possible superimposed pulmonary edema,
   diffuse hemorrhage, or ARDS.
   - Continue pressure support as patient tolerates
   - D/C
d Vancomycin IV  per pulm (pt had gotten 16d treatment)
   - D/C
d solumedrol that pt was transferred from OSH with
   - f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   - diurese with 40mg IV lasix daily -consider [**Hospital1 **] for goal UO 500cc/day
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - AM CXR
   .
   #  Diffuse T wave inversions: Differential includes cardiac ischemia,
   cerebrovascular injury, or cardiomyopathy.  Given history of SAH, and
   recently starting plavix, exacerbation of prior head bleed is a
   possibility. Patient's neurologic exam is focal given prior CVA, but at
   her baseline. OSH Head CT on [**8-20**] showed no intracranial hemorrhage or
   mass.
   -obtain OSH CT head imaging
   -rule out ischemia, as per above
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT 24.8.  Patient received 1u PRBCs today.
   Unclear what admission HCT was initially. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**]
   hospitalization here was 26-28. Iron 49, Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
   anemia of chronic disease picture with extremely high ferritin.
   -guaiac stools
   .
   #  Multiple fractures seen on x-ray: Patient is scheduled to be seen in
   orthopedic clinic in [**2160-8-28**] here at [**Hospital1 19**].
   -Pain control with morphine and percocet, per prior regimen
   .
   #  Depression: Continue prozac

   findings in chest. Started Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for broad coverage. CXR
   pending. Blood cx, pending, sputum cx from mini BAL negative up to this
   point.  After discussion on [**Last Name (LF) 2585**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] also plan for Pt to go to
   cardiac cath today to evaluate potential contribution of
   ischemia/elevated filling pressures to ongoing pulmonary issues.
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery in 2149. She also has two drug-eluting stents (DES) placed in 2159. The patient presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, leading to acute respiratory failure, which is concerning for an ischemic etiology.

The patient's recent events include:
- On 8-19, a trial of tracheostomy (TM) at OSH showed arterial blood gas (ABG) demonstrating hypercarbia and hypoxia.
- Vancomycin was stopped.
- A mini bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was done, with results pending. No polymorphonuclear leukocytes or microorganisms were seen.
- On 8-21 at 2149, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed using left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the posterolateral wall, SVG posteroanterior descending artery (PDA), and SVG to the omohyoid branch.
- The pulmonary consult agreed with discontinuing vancomycin, diuresis, and ordering a CT chest.
- An arterial line was placed.
- The patient experienced episodes of chest discomfort around 4:30 pm and 8:30 pm, but EKGs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2149.
- She presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and was transferred from another hospital with acute respiratory failure.
- The patient has known systolic heart failure and severe peripheral vascular disease.
- Upon admission, her vital signs were stable, but she was slightly volume overloaded.
- She has been diagnosed with diffuse ground-glass and interlobular septal thickening on chest CT, along with focal areas of consolidation and a small left pleural effusion.
- Increased mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is also noted, which could suggest an infectious cause such as viral or mycoplasmal infection.
- Other differential considerations include superimposed pulmonary edema, diffuse hemorrhage, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient's troponin-T levels are negative, making stent thrombosis unlikely.
- She is currently on various cardiac medications, including carvedilol, aspirin, Plavix, lisinopril, and Atorvastatin.
- Her ejection fraction (EF) has improved from 20% to 35% based on an echo done at the other hospital.
- The patient's neurological examination is focal due to a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), but it is at her baseline.

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2149 and had two drug-eluting stents placed. She also has severe peripheral vascular disease, known systolic heart failure, and presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU with diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, which raises concerns for pneumonia, pulmonary edema, diffuse hemorrhage, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's medical history includes multiple comorbidities such as coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, systolic heart failure, and multiple fractures. She is on various medications including carvedilol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, ASA, Plavix, and nitroglycerin.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 104/40 mmHg to 133/52 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's neurological exam is focal, likely due to a prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA), but at her baseline.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple health issues. The patient underwent CABG surgery and has been experiencing episodes of chest discomfort, which resolved spontaneously without intervention. The patient's allergies include Cardizem (oral) and Lipitor (muscle aches). The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and lorazepam (Ativan) for anxiety.

Vital signs show a temperature of 100.2°F (37.9°C), heart rate of 70 bpm with a sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 104/40 mmHg to 133/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission at 65.3 kg.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,072 mL of total fluids, including 427 mL of PO, 190 mL of TF, and 262 mL of IVF. Output includes 2,479 mL of total output, with 260 mL of urine output. The overall fluid balance is -1,407 mL.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode with a set tidal volume of 363 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 140, and the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) is 228.

The patient's blood work shows normal levels for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. Other lab results indicate slightly elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, troponin T, and lactic acid. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

The assessment and plan state that the patient has respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), and ICU care is being provided. The patient is receiving nutritional support through Boost Glucose Control at a rate of 30 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being monitored, and the patient has multi-lumen and arterial lines in place for medical management. Prophylactic measures include DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable with ongoing management of respiratory failure, monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and close attention to laboratory values."

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning for ischemic etiology.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. This is unlikely in
   stent thrombosis given negative cardiac enzymes at OSH. Admission EKG
   looks unchanged from baseline. However, EKG on transfer shows diffuse
   TWI, with ST depressions in V2-V6, with ST elevations in aVR.  Patient
   appears slightly volume overloaded, which certainly could be secondary
   to cardiac ischemia.
   - Chest pain yesterday afternoon
 no enzyme leak, ECG unchanged
   likely anxiety component, relieved with Ativan
   - Trend CEs
 continue to be negative
   - Will discuss potential cath today
   - Carvedilol 25mg po bid

   - Atorvastatin 80mg
   - SL nitro PRN CP
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic Congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] currently appears mild fluid
   overloaded. Though JVP difficult to assess given ventilatory support
   and trach collar. LE only have 1+ edema bilaterally. Crackles and
   wheezes bilaterally. Unclear cause of this exacerbation. Differential
   includes ischemia.
   - Lasix 40mg IV daily, Lasix 20 po bid - titrate to UO goal 500cc/day
   - Continue lisinopril, carvedilol
   - Rule out MI as per above
   - Obtain OSH Echo imaging on CD
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Patient apparently has bilateral infiltrates
   per OSH records with multiple sputum cultures + for MRSA with 50,000
   colonies. Differential includes pneumonia vs. fluid overload from CHF
   vs. ARDS.  Given elevated BNP, with clinical signs of mild fluid
   overload, and decreased systolic function seen on echo, it's hard to
   confirm diagnosis of ARDS [**12-31**] chronic aspiration. Pulm consulted and
   believes respiratory failure [**12-31**] fluid overload from HF. Chest CT read
   as likely infectious cause with possible superimposed pulmonary edema,
   diffuse hemorrhage, or ARDS.
   - Continue pressure support as patient tolerates

   - AM CXR
   .
   #  Diffuse T wave inversions: Differential includes cardiac ischemia,
   cerebrovascular injury, or cardiomyopathy.  Given history of SAH, and
   recently starting plavix, exacerbation of prior head bleed is a
   possibility. Patient's neurologic exam is focal given prior CVA, but at
   her baseline. OSH Head CT on [**8-20**] showed no intracranial hemorrhage or
   mass.
   -obtain OSH CT head imaging
   -rule out ischemia, as per above

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and two drug-eluting stents in place. She also has severe peripheral vascular disease and known systolic heart failure. The patient presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and was transferred from another hospital with acute respiratory failure, concerning for ischemic etiology.

The patient's recent events include:
- On 08/19, a trial of tracheostomy (TM) at OSH showed arterial blood gas (ABG) demonstrating hypercarbia and hypoxia.
- Vancomycin was stopped.
- A mini bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was done, with results pending, showing no polymorphonuclear leukocytes or microorganisms.
- On 08/21 at 2149, the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the diagonal branch, saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the posterolateral descending artery (PDA), SVG to the omohyoid marginal branch (OM), and SVG to the obtuse marginal (OM).
- The pulmonary residents agreed with discontinuing vancomycin, diuresis, and obtaining a chest CT.
- An arterial line was placed.
- The patient had episodes of chest discomfort around 4:30 pm and again around 8:"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD, s/p remote CABG, 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic CHF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning for ischemic etiology.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG x2 (unclear anatomy) s/p
   DES in [**2159**].  This is unlikely in stent thrombosis given negative
   cardiac enzymes at OSH. Admission EKG looks unchanged from baseline.
   However, EKG on transfer shows diffuse TWI, with ST depressions in
   V2-V6, with ST elevations in aVR.  Patient appears slightly volume
   overloaded, which certainly could be secondary to cardiac ischemia.
   -trend CEs here
   -obtain repeat EKG in AM
   -Continue carvedilol 25mg po bid
   -ASA 325mg mg po daily
   -Plavix 75mg po daily
   -Lisinopril 10mg po daily
   -Atorvastatin 80mg
   -SL nitro PRN CP
   -NPO for potential cath tomorrow
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic Congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] currently appears mild fluid
   overloaded. Though JVP difficult to assess given 1+ TR seen on echo. LE
   only have 1+ edema bilaterally. Some crackles at bases. Unclear cause
   of this exacerbation. Differential includes ischemia.
   -lasix 40mg IV daily -titrate to UO goal 500cc/day
   -continue lisinopril, carvedilol
   -rule out MI as per above
   -obtain OSH Echo imaging on CD
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   -monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Patient apparently has bilateral infiltrates
   per OSH records with multiple sputum cultures + for MRSA. Differential
   includes pneumonia vs. fluid overload from CHF vs. ARDS.  Given
   elevated BNP, with clinical signs of mild fluid overload, and decreased
   systolic function seen on echo, it's hard to confirm diagnosis of ARDS
   [**12-31**] chronic aspiration.  Apparently patient had full body CT at OSH.
   Would obtain OSH chest CT images for further information.
   -Continue pressure support as patient tolerates
   -Vancomycin IV for MRSA pneumonia -patient started on [**8-5**]. Unclear why
   patient hasn't cleared cultures, or if patient has been therapeutic on
   Vancomycin.
   -repeat sputum cultures
   -blood cultures
   -diurese with 40mg IV lasix daily -consider [**Hospital1 **] for goal UO 500cc/day
   -continue albuterol and ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   -AM CXR
   .
   #  Diffuse T wave inversions: Differential includes cardiac ischemia,
   cerebrovascular injury, or cardiomyopathy.  Given history of SAH, and
   recently starting plavix, exacerbation of prior head bleed is a
   possibility. Patient's neurologic exam is focal given prior CVA, but at
   her baseline. OSH Head CT on [**8-20**] showed no intracranial hemorrhage or
   mass.
   -obtain OSH CT head imaging
   -rule out ischemia, as per above
   .
   # Leukocytosis: WBC 12.3.  Likely secondary to MRSA+ pneumonia. Patient
   was also recently on solumedrol (stopped on transfer).
   -trend fever curve
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -obtain UA
   -obtain blood cultures
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT 24.8.  Patient received 1u PRBCs today.
   Unclear what admission HCT was initially. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**]
   hospitalization here was 26-28.
   -iron studies
   -guaiac stools
   .
   #  Multiple fractures seen on x-ray: Patient is scheduled to be seen in
   orthopedic clinic in [**2160-8-28**] here at [**Hospital1 19**].
   -Pain control with morphine and percocet, per prior regimen
   .
   #  Depression: Continue prozac
   .
   #  Seizure prophylaxis: Continue keppra

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on [**2149**]. She also has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and systolic heart failure. The patient presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, leading to acute respiratory failure, concerning for ischemic etiology.

During her stay at the outside hospital (OSH), she received treatment with vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia and showed improvement in her condition. However, on transfer to this hospital, she experienced an episode of chest discomfort, which was managed with lorazepam. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 104/40 mmHg to 133/52 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse expiratory wheezes bilaterally and crackles at the bases of the lungs. She has mild bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows interactive behavior with decreased strength in the right lower extremity. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.3, normocytic anemia with a Hct of 24.8, and elevated troponin T levels.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has known CAD with recent CABG surgery. The EKG shows diffuse T-wave inversions, which could be due to cardiac ischemia, cerebrovascular injury, or cardiomyopathy. Further evaluation is needed to rule out ischemia.

2. Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20% one month prior. The recent echocardiogram at OSH shows an EF of 35%, and there is also moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient appears mildly fluid overloaded, and it is unclear about the cause of this exacerbation. Differential includes ischemia.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on imaging, with multiple sputum cultures positive for MRSA. The differential includes pneumonia, fluid overload from CHF, or ARDS. The chest CT suggests an infectious cause with possible superimposed pulmonary edema, diffuse hemorrhage, or ARDS.

4. Normocytic Anemia: The patient's Hct is 24.8, indicating normocytic anemia. She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) today. The baseline Hct from a previous hospitalization was 26-28.

5. Multiple Fractures: The patient has multiple fractures seen on x-ray. She is scheduled to be seen in the orthopedic clinic on [**2160-8-28**].

6. Depression: The patient continues on prozac for depression.

7. Seizure Prophylaxis: The patient continues on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.

8. Nutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds through a G-tube at a goal rate of 55cc/L with additional free water.

9. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving various prophylactic measures, including DVT ppx with heparin SQ, pain management with morphine, bowel regimen with docusate, and seizure prophylaxis with keppra.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Ischemia: The diffuse T-wave inversions on the EKG raise concerns for cardiac ischemia. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia, fluid overload from CHF, or ARDS. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to improve her respiratory status.

3. Normocytic Anemia: The patient's normocytic anemia may be secondary to chronic disease or acute blood loss. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

4. Multiple Fractures: The patient's multiple fractures may require orthopedic evaluation and management. Pain control and prevention of complications are important in her care.

5. Depression: The patient's depression should be managed with ongoing psychiatric support and medication.

6. Seizure Prophylaxis: The patient's seizure prophylaxis requires ongoing management to prevent seizures.

Please note that the information provided is based on the progress note, and further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be required to confirm the potential medical complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and placement of drug-eluting stents (DES). She also has a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and known systolic heart failure (HF). The patient presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and was transferred from another hospital with acute respiratory failure, possibly due to ischemic etiology.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient experienced several medical complications. She had increased somnolence and was concerned for sepsis versus intracranial process, given her recent intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). A CT scan of the head showed increased ventriculomegaly. Neurological and neurosurgical consultations were obtained, and the patient was scheduled for drain placement.

The patient also had hypotension overnight, with blood pressures in the 70s systolic and 40s mean arterial pressure (MAP). She received a 500cc bolus and responded appropriately. Her respiratory status worsened, with progressive hypoxemia, increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Serial arterial blood gases (ABGs) were obtained.

The patient's lab results showed leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and elevated troponin T. Other lab values"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning for ischemic etiology.
   .
   # Mental status
 likely deteriorating [**12-31**] ventriculomegaly and
   hydrocephalus, possible non-communicating hydrocephalus in setting of
   recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   - to OR this AM for urgent placement of ventriculostomy
   - will f/u neurosurg recs, appreciate input
   - avoid sedatives as able
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. This is unlikely in
   stent thrombosis given negative cardiac enzymes at OSH. Admission EKG
   looks unchanged from baseline. However, EKG on transfer shows diffuse
   TWI, with ST depressions in V2-V6, with ST elevations in aVR.  Patient
   appears slightly volume overloaded, which certainly could be secondary
   to cardiac ischemia.
   - Chest pain 2 days ago
 no enzyme leak, ECG unchanged
 likely
   anxiety component, relieved with Ativan
   - Trend CEs
 continue to be negative
   - Will discuss potential cath -> deferred, likely low yield; also
   deferred swan placement yesterday in setting of mental status changes,
   CT head findings
   - Carvedilol 25mg po bid

   - Atorvastatin 80mg
   - SL nitro PRN CP
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic Congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] currently appears mild fluid
   overloaded. Though JVP difficult to assess given ventilatory support
   and trach collar. LE only have 1+ edema bilaterally. Crackles and
   wheezes bilaterally. Unclear cause of this exacerbation. Differential
   includes ischemia.
   - Lasix 40mg IV daily, Lasix 20 po bid - titrate to UO goal 500cc/day
   - Continue lisinopril, carvedilol
   - Rule out MI as per above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Patient apparently has bilateral infiltrates
   per OSH records with multiple sputum cultures + for MRSA with 50,000
   colonies. Differential includes pneumonia vs. fluid overload from CHF
   vs. ARDS.  Given elevated BNP, with clinical signs of mild fluid
   overload, and decreased systolic function seen on echo, it's hard to
   confirm diagnosis of ARDS [**12-31**] chronic aspiration. Pulm consulted and
   believes respiratory failure [**12-31**] fluid overload from HF. Chest CT read
   as likely infectious cause with possible superimposed pulmonary edema,
   diffuse hemorrhage, or ARDS.
   - Continue pressure support as patient tolerates -> pt had increasing
   respiratory distress, possible [**12-31**] worsening pulm infection with
   underlying anxiety
   - D/C
d solumedrol that pt was transferred from OSH with
   - f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   - diurese with 40mg IV lasix daily -consider [**Hospital1 **] for goal UO 500cc/day
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - AM CXR
   - cont vanc, cefepime, cipro for double pseudomonas coverage
   .
   #  Diffuse T wave inversions: Differential includes cardiac ischemia,
   cerebrovascular injury, or cardiomyopathy.  Given history of SAH, and
   recently starting plavix, exacerbation of prior head bleed is a
   possibility. Patient's neurologic exam is focal given prior CVA, but at
   her baseline. OSH Head CT on [**8-20**] showed no intracranial hemorrhage or
   mass.
   -obtain OSH CT head imaging -> no evidence of ventriculomegaly on this

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG, AAA, severe PVD, and systolic HF. She presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and is transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure, concerning for ischemic etiology. The patient has worsening mental status, likely deteriorating due to ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, possible non-communicating hydrocephalus in the setting of a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. She is scheduled for urgent placement of ventriculostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic heart disease: The patient has a history of CAD, previous CABG, and DES. She presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, which could be indicative of ischemic heart disease.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on OSH records and positive sputum cultures for MRSA. This suggests pneumonia or fluid overload from CHF, making it difficult to confirm the diagnosis of ARDS or chronic aspiration.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and increasing respiratory distress, indicating a possible worsening pulmonary infection.
4. Hydrocephalus: The patient has increased ventriculomegaly on CT head, likely secondary to a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. This can lead to mental status changes and neurological deterioration.
5. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has systolic congest"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and double drug-eluting stents in place. She also has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), systolic heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presents with dyspnea, chest pain, and shortness of breath. She was transferred from an outside hospital with acute respiratory failure, suspected ischemic etiology. Upon admission, the patient appeared slightly volume overloaded, which could be secondary to cardiac ischemia. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has known CAD with previous CABG and DES placement. Admission EKG shows diffuse T-wave inversions with ST depressions in V2-V6 and ST elevations in aVR. Trending cardiac enzymes continue to be negative, making stent thrombosis less likely. The patient's chest pain is likely related to anxiety, as there is no enzyme leak and ECG unchanged. However, potential cardiac catheterization will be discussed today. Medications include carvedilol, ASA, Plavix, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and SL nitro PRN for chest pain.

2. Systolic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with"

   Disposition:
","The patient presents with dyspnea and has a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for heart failure and respiratory failure. The patient has shown increased somnolence, fever, and worsening respiratory status. The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension with SBPs in the 70s and MAPs in the 40s, but they responded appropriately to a 500 cc bolus. The patient's oxygenation is compromised, as indicated by hypoxemia and the need for increased PEEP and FiO2. The patient's ABGs show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 43, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 103, and Ve of 10.3 L/min.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. They are also on morphine sulfate for pain management and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place, and their respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV+ApnVol ventilation mode with set Vt of 350 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR set at 12, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and PIP of 23 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, anxiety, and tachypnea. Their cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, except for difficult auscultation over the vent. They have bilateral lower extremity edema, and their neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient being more alert this morning.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count of 244 mg/dL, decreased hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 36 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 31 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status, sepsis, intracranial process, and heart failure exacerbation."

   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning for ischemic etiology.
   .
   # Mental status
 likely deteriorating [**12-31**] ventriculomegaly and
   hydrocephalus, possible non-communicating hydrocephalus in setting of
   recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   - to OR yesterday for urgent placement of ventriculostomy
   - will f/u neurosurg recs, appreciate input
   - avoid sedatives as able
 currently off propofol
   .
   # Klebsielly pna, possible infected scalp hematoma.
   - meropenem started [**8-23**].  cipro and cefepime stopped.
   - continue vanc until scalp culture returns
   - continue to f/u all cultures
   - will send csf cultures today
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Patient apparently has bilateral infiltrates
   per OSH records with multiple sputum cultures + for MRSA with 50,000
   colonies. Differential includes pneumonia vs. fluid overload from CHF
   vs. ARDS.  Given elevated BNP, with clinical signs of mild fluid
   overload, and decreased systolic function seen on echo, it's hard to
   confirm diagnosis of ARDS [**12-31**] chronic aspiration. Pulm consulted and
   believes respiratory failure [**12-31**] fluid overload from HF. Chest CT read
   as likely infectious cause with possible superimposed pulmonary edema,
   diffuse hemorrhage, or ARDS.
   - Continue pressure support as patient tolerates -> pt had increasing
   respiratory distress, possible [**12-31**] worsening pulm infection with
   underlying anxiety
   - D/C
d solumedrol that pt was transferred from OSH with
   - f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   - diurese with 40mg IV lasix daily -consider [**Hospital1 **] for goal UO 500cc/day
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - AM CXR daily
   - cont vanc, meropenem for klebsiella in sputum

   - f/u PM lytes
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. This is unlikely in
   stent thrombosis given negative cardiac enzymes at OSH. Admission EKG
   looks unchanged from baseline. However, EKG on transfer shows diffuse
   TWI, with ST depressions in V2-V6, with ST elevations in aVR.  Patient
   appears slightly volume overloaded, which certainly could be secondary
   to cardiac ischemia.
   - Chest pain 2 days ago
 no enzyme leak, ECG unchanged
 likely
   anxiety component, relieved with Ativan
   - Trend CEs
 continue to be negative
   - Will discuss potential cath -> deferred, likely low yield; also

   # PUMP:  Systolic Congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] currently appears mild fluid
   overloaded. Though JVP difficult to assess given ventilatory support
   and trach collar. LE only have 1+ edema bilaterally. Crackles and
   wheezes bilaterally. Unclear cause of this exacerbation. Differential
   includes ischemia.
   - Lasix 40mg IV daily  titrate to goal 500cc/day neg or even
   - Continue lisinopril, carvedilol
   - Rule out MI as per above
 all trops have been neg
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Diffuse T wave inversions: Differential includes cardiac ischemia,
   cerebrovascular injury, or cardiomyopathy.  Given history of SAH, and
   recently starting plavix, exacerbation of prior head bleed is a
   possibility. Patient's neurologic exam is focal given prior CVA, but at
   her baseline. OSH Head CT on [**8-20**] showed no intracranial hemorrhage or
   mass.
   -obtain OSH CT head imaging -> no evidence of ventriculomegaly on this
   scan
   -rule out ischemia, as per above

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and two drug-eluting stents in place. She also has severe peripheral vascular disease and known systolic heart failure. The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) with acute respiratory failure, concerning for ischemic etiology.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including deteriorating mental status likely due to ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, possible non-communicating hydrocephalus in the setting of a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. She underwent an urgent placement of a ventriculostomy yesterday.

The patient is also diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumonia, possible infected scalp hematoma, and respiratory failure. She has bilateral infiltrates per OSH records with multiple sputum cultures positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with 50,000 colonies. The differential includes pneumonia versus fluid overload from congestive heart failure (CHF) versus acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Given the elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), with clinical signs of mild fluid overload, and decreased systolic function seen on echocardiogram, it's hard to confirm the diagnosis of ARDS [12-31] chronic aspiration.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. She has a history of chronic heart failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent a ventricular drain placement due to increased intracranial pressure. A deep infected hematoma on her head was debrided, which is likely the source of infection. She is now on wet-to-dry dressings for wound care.

The patient has been experiencing fever spikes, with the highest recorded temperature of 102.5°F (Tmax). Cultures of sputum and mini BAL grew Klebsiella oxytoca, which is resistant to ceftriaxone. The patient's antibiotics were changed from vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime to vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient has allergies to Cardizem and Lipitor, causing muscle aches. She has been receiving various medications including furosemide, morphine sulfate, and other ICU medications.

Flow Sheet Data:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 102.5°F, heart rate is 82 bpm, blood pressure is 133/47 mmHg, respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg, intracranial pressure (ICP) is -1 mm"

   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning for ischemic etiology.
   .
   # Mental status
 likely deteriorating [**12-31**] ventriculomegaly and
   hydrocephalus, possible non-communicating hydrocephalus in setting of
   recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   - to OR yesterday for urgent placement of ventriculostomy
   - will f/u neurosurg recs, appreciate input
   - avoid sedatives as able
 currently off propofol
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. This is unlikely in
   stent thrombosis given negative cardiac enzymes at OSH. Admission EKG
   looks unchanged from baseline. However, EKG on transfer shows diffuse
   TWI, with ST depressions in V2-V6, with ST elevations in aVR.  Patient
   appears slightly volume overloaded, which certainly could be secondary
   to cardiac ischemia.
   - Chest pain 2 days ago
 no enzyme leak, ECG unchanged

   # PUMP:  Systolic Congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] currently appears mild fluid
   overloaded. Though JVP difficult to assess given ventilatory support
   and trach collar. LE only have 1+ edema bilaterally. Crackles and
   wheezes bilaterally. Unclear cause of this exacerbation. Differential
   includes ischemia.
   - Lasix 40mg IV daily, Lasix 20 po bid - titrate to UO goal 500cc/day
   - Continue lisinopril, carvedilol
   - Rule out MI as per above
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Patient apparently has bilateral infiltrates
   per OSH records with multiple sputum cultures + for MRSA with 50,000
   colonies. Differential includes pneumonia vs. fluid overload from CHF
   vs. ARDS.  Given elevated BNP, with clinical signs of mild fluid
   overload, and decreased systolic function seen on echo, it's hard to
   confirm diagnosis of ARDS [**12-31**] chronic aspiration. Pulm consulted and
   believes respiratory failure [**12-31**] fluid overload from HF. Chest CT read
   as likely infectious cause with possible superimposed pulmonary edema,
   diffuse hemorrhage, or ARDS.
   - Continue pressure support as patient tolerates -> pt had increasing
   respiratory distress, possible [**12-31**] worsening pulm infection with
   underlying anxiety
   - D/C
d solumedrol that pt was transferred from OSH with
   - f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   - diurese with 40mg IV lasix daily -consider [**Hospital1 **] for goal UO 500cc/day
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - AM CXR
   - cont vanc, meropenem for klebsiella in sputum
   .
   #  Diffuse T wave inversions: Differential includes cardiac ischemia,
   cerebrovascular injury, or cardiomyopathy.  Given history of SAH, and
   recently starting plavix, exacerbation of prior head bleed is a
   possibility. Patient's neurologic exam is focal given prior CVA, but at
   her baseline. OSH Head CT on [**8-20**] showed no intracranial hemorrhage or
   mass.
   -obtain OSH CT head imaging -> no evidence of ventriculomegaly on this
   scan
   -rule out ischemia, as per above
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT 24.8.  Patient received 1u PRBCs today.
   Unclear what admission HCT was initially. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**]
   hospitalization here was 26-28. Iron 49, Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, and DES placement in two coronary vessels. She also has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease and systolic heart failure. The patient presented with chest pain and shortness of breath, leading to acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for ischemic etiology.

She was taken to the operating room for urgent placement of a ventriculostomy due to deteriorating mental status, ventriculomegaly, and hydrocephalus. The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. She has been experiencing bilateral infiltrates, possible fluid overload from CHF, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus: The patient's deteriorating mental status, ventriculomegaly, and hydrocephalus suggest the possibility of increased intracranial pressure. Monitoring of ICP and neurologic status is essential.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been experiencing fever and has positive sputum cultures for MRSA. There is a risk of developing sepsis, particularly with the presence of a central line and ventilatory support.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral infiltrates and respiratory distress, which may indicate pneumonia or fluid overload. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory effort is necessary.

   #  Respiratory failure: Patient apparently has bilateral infiltrates

   confirm diagnosis of ARDS [**12-31**] chronic aspiration. Pulm consulted and
   believes respiratory failure [**12-31**] fluid overload from HF. Chest CT read
   as likely infectious cause with possible superimposed pulmonary edema,

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. She has multiple comorbidities including severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease. The patient's current condition includes Klebsiella pneumonia, possible infected scalp hematoma, respiratory failure, hyponatremia, and normocytic anemia. She also has multiple fractures and a history of depression and seizure disorder. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus: The patient has signs of deteriorating mental status and ventriculomegaly, possibly due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage. This could lead to increased intracranial pressure and further neurological deterioration.
2. Infected scalp hematoma: The patient has a scalp hematoma with suspected infection, which could progress to a more serious infection such as meningitis or sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia or fluid overload from CHF. This may require further intervention such as bronchoscopy or tracheostomy.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has new-onset hypon"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, the note highlights several significant events including the removal of an arterial line and multi-lumen central venous catheter, as well as blood cultures taken. The patient is also experiencing fever with a temperature of 101.7°F.

The patient has known allergies to Cardizem (Oral) and Lipitor (Oral). The last dose of antibiotics was administered on 08/23/20 at 04:00 PM, which included Cefepime, Ciprofloxacin, Meropenem, and Vancomycin. 

The patient is currently receiving multiple infusions, including Furosemide (Lasix) and Morphine sulfate. Additionally, there are other medications being administered as part of the ICU care.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.7°C (101.7°F), heart rate of 89 bpm with a range of 69-89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/60 mmHg to 92/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute with a range of 17-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 3 mmHg with a range of 3-6 mmHg, and intracranial pressure (ICP) of 11 mmHg with a range of 0-11 mmHg. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 2,134 mL and output of 2,573 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 439 mL.

Respiratory support is being provided through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode ventilation. The tidal volume (Vt) is set at 424 mL with a range of 370-430 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is at 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 60%, and the plateau pressure (PIP) is 27 cmH2O.

The patient's blood work shows elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 0.5 mg/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) at 211 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 24.3%, platelet count (Plt) at 197 K/uL, troponin-T at <0.01 ng/mL, lactate at 1.3 mmol/L, and lactic acid at 1.3 mmol/L. The patient's glucose levels are consistently high, ranging from 68 mg/dL to 226 mg/dL. Other lab results are also provided.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Also suspect volume
   overload given her poor systolic function.  No recent CXR however prior
   studies concerning for infection and volume overload, cannot r/o ARDS.
   - Pt tolerated wean on PS well.  Continue to wean as tolerated.
   - pt spiked/cultured last night, continue to follow cxs
   - continue to diurese with 40mg IV lasix daily  for goal UO [**Telephone/Fax (1) 179**]
   cc/day
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - cont vanc, meropenem for hx of MRSA and recent klebsiella in sputum
   .
   # Mental status
 improving.  Likely [**12-31**] ventriculomegaly and
   hydrocephalus, may also be a component of delirium secondary to her
   PNA.   Drain placed by neuronsurg for non-communicating hydrocephalus
   in setting of recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   - will f/u neurosurg recs, appreciate input
   - avoid sedatives as able, however will re-start home dose of fentanyl
   for chronic pain
   .
   # scalp hematoma: dressed, no evidence of active bleed or infection.
   If infected, pt covered by vanc, however no evidence of infection at
   this time.
   -continue wound care
   -wound cultures pending
   .
   # hyponatremia: new onset in setting of ventriculostomy and D5NS
   overnight.   Concern for SIADH.  Holding NS for now.
   - f/u PM lytes
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. This is unlikely in
   stent thrombosis given negative cardiac enzymes at OSH. Admission EKG
   looks unchanged from baseline. However, EKG on transfer shows diffuse
   TWI, with ST depressions in V2-V6, with ST elevations in aVR.  Patient
   appears slightly volume overloaded, which certainly could be secondary
   to cardiac ischemia.  Given her negative CEs and EKG, pain thought
   secondary to anxiety.  Troponins negative to date.  No plan for Cath at
   this time.
   - Ativan for anxiety
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.
   Will f/u with neurosurg regarding re-starting plavix given her recent
   stent placement.
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic Congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] currently appears mild fluid
   overloaded and had inadequate UOP yesterday.
   - Lasix 40mg IV daily  titrate to goal negative 500cc-1L today
   - Continue lisinopril, carvedilol
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Diffuse T wave inversions: Differential includes cardiac ischemia,
   cerebrovascular injury, or cardiomyopathy.  Given history of SAH, and
   recently starting plavix, exacerbation of prior head bleed is a
   possibility. Patient's neurologic exam is focal given prior CVA, but at
   her baseline. OSH Head CT on [**8-20**] showed no intracranial hemorrhage or
   mass.  No evidence of active ischemia at this time.
   -obtain OSH CT head imaging -> no evidence of ventriculomegaly on this
   scan
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT 24.7 today and has been stable. Baseline from
   [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization here was 26-28. Iron 49, Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
 anemia of chronic disease picture with extremely high ferritin.  Will
   not transfuse today given that she does not appear to have active
   ischemia.
   - follow daily crit
   -guaiac all stools

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [**2149**]. She has a past medical history of systolic congestive heart failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU due to respiratory failure, suspected to be secondary to pneumonia (PNA) or volume overload. 

The patient's recent course has been complicated by several issues. She was found to have a scalp hematoma, which is currently being managed with wound care and monitored for signs of infection. The patient also has mental status changes, likely due to a combination of ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, possibly secondary to a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. A drain has been placed by neurosurgery to address this. 

Additionally, the patient has developed hyponatremia, which is being monitored and treated appropriately. There are concerns about possible SIADH. The patient's coronary arteries are well-stented, but there is evidence of diffuse T wave inversions on the EKG, which could indicate cardiac ischemia or anxiety. 

The patient's heart failure is being managed with diuretics and cardiac medications. She has a history of multiple fractures, and orthopedic follow-up is planned. She is also on medications for depression and seizure prophylaxis. 

Overall, the patient's condition remains complex, with multiple potential medical complications that need to be addressed."

   # Mental status
 likely deteriorating [**12-31**] ventriculomegaly and
   hydrocephalus, possible non-communicating hydrocephalus in setting of
   recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   - to OR yesterday for urgent placement of ventriculostomy
   - will f/u neurosurg recs, appreciate input
   - avoid sedatives as able
 currently off propofol
   .
   # Klebsielly pna, possible infected scalp hematoma.
   - meropenem started [**8-23**].  cipro and cefepime stopped.
   - continue vanc until scalp culture returns
   - continue to f/u all cultures
   - will send csf cultures today
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Patient apparently has bilateral infiltrates
   per OSH records with multiple sputum cultures + for MRSA with 50,000
   colonies. Differential includes pneumonia vs. fluid overload from CHF
   vs. ARDS.  Given elevated BNP, with clinical signs of mild fluid
   overload, and decreased systolic function seen on echo, it's hard to
   confirm diagnosis of ARDS [**12-31**] chronic aspiration. Pulm consulted and
   believes respiratory failure [**12-31**] fluid overload from HF. Chest CT read
   as likely infectious cause with possible superimposed pulmonary edema,
   diffuse hemorrhage, or ARDS.
   - Continue pressure support as patient tolerates -> pt had increasing
   respiratory distress, possible [**12-31**] worsening pulm infection with
   underlying anxiety

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2149. She also has two drug-eluting stents (DES) in place, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and known systolic heart failure (HF). The patient presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and was transferred from another hospital (OSH) with acute respiratory failure, possibly due to ischemic etiology.

The patient has several medical complications that need attention. 

1. Mental status changes: The patient likely has deteriorating mental status, ventriculomegaly, and hydrocephalus, possibly non-communicating in the setting of a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. An urgent placement of ventriculostomy was done, and neurosurgical recommendations are being followed. Avoiding sedatives is also advised.

2. Klebsiella pneumonia (PNA): The patient has been diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumonia, and meropenem has been started. Other antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and cefepime, have been stopped. Cultures are being continued, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures will be sent today.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient appears to have bilateral infiltrates per OSH records with multiple sputum"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2149. She also has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and known systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and was transferred from an outside hospital with acute respiratory failure. The initial concern was pneumonia versus volume overload. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.

24-hour events include the removal of an arterial line and multi-lumen catheter. The patient developed a fever and blood cultures were drawn. Klebsiella was identified in mini-ball culture, and the patient was started on meropenem. PEEP was decreased from 12 to 10, and PSV weaning was started.

Allergies include diltiazem Hcl, atorvastatin calcium, and muscle aches. Antibiotics administered include cefipime, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and vancomycin. Infusions include furosemide (Lasix) and morphine sulfate.

Vital signs show a temperature of 101.7°F, blood pressure ranging from 154/60 mmHg to 92/37 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 89-34 bpm, respiratory rate ranging from 17-34 breaths"

   appears slightly volume overloaded, which certainly could be secondary
   to cardiac ischemia.  Given her negative CEs and EKG, pain thought

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. She has severe peripheral vascular disease, known systolic heart failure, and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2149. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, suspected pneumonia versus volume overload, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. She has multiple medical complications including hyponatremia, normocytic anemia, scalp hematoma, mental status changes, and diffuse T-wave inversions on EKG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with ongoing need for invasive ventilation. Klebsiella infection has been identified in recent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has positive sputum cultures for MRSA and Klebsiella, indicating an ongoing infection.
3. Volume Overload: The patient shows signs of fluid overload, which can exacerbate her poor systolic function.
4. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's EKG shows diffuse T-wave inversions, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia.
5. Mental Status Changes: The patient is experiencing mental status changes, likely due to a combination of ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, and delirium secondary to her pneumonia.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [**2149**]. She also has two drug-eluting stents (DES) in place, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and known systolic heart failure (SHF). The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure, which led to her transfer from an outside hospital.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, suspected pneumonia versus volume overload. She has positive sputum cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at the outside hospital and klebsiella on recent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient tolerated weaning from invasive ventilation using pressure support (PS) well and continues to be weaned as tolerated. The cultures from last night are pending.

The patient has mental status changes, likely due to ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, which may also be a component of delirium secondary to her pneumonia. A drain was placed by neurosurgeons for non-communicating hydrocephalus in the setting of a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The patient also has a scalp hematoma, which is dressed and showing no evidence of active bleed or infection. Wound care is continued"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [**2149**]. She also has two drug-eluting stents (DES) in place, an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and known systolic heart failure (SHF). The patient presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure, leading to transfer from the outside hospital with concerns for pneumonia versus volume overload. 

Upon admission, the patient was sedated with propofol and switched to assisted control ventilation (ACV) due to worsening respiratory status. The patient's blood cultures revealed MRSA initially but have since grown klebsiella on a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient's chest X-ray showed worsening right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate, raising concerns for worsening pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is also a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) and cardiac ischemia given the worsening ST depressions, although this is less likely considering the CXR findings.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate (HR) of 105 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 142/58 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 92%. The patient's physical examination reveals that she is sedated and unresponsive, flushed, hot, and has minimal bilateral lower extremity edema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.0 K/uL, normal hemoglobin (Hgb) at 8.4 g/dL, elevated lactate levels at 1.3 mmol/L, and elevated liver enzymes such as aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT). The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for hyponatremia with a sodium level of 126 mEq/L.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing assisted control ventilation with pressure support, stat chest X-ray, re-culture and follow-up for growth, administration of diuretics, and antibiotic coverage for MRSA and klebsiella. An ID consult has been requested to determine appropriate antibiotic coverage given the patient's worsening condition on current antibiotics. A pulmonologist consult is also pending for possible bronchoscopy.

Regarding the patient's mental status, she is likely experiencing ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, which may be a component of delirium secondary to her pneumonia and hypoxemia. A drain was placed by neurosurgery for non-communicating hydrocephalus in the setting of a recent subarachnoid"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure and is currently on invasive ventilation. There is a concern for pneumonia versus volume overload. The patient's recent BAL culture showed klebsiella, and they are already on vancomycin and meropenem for MRSA and recent klebsiella in sputum.

2. Mental status changes: The patient has been improving but likely has ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, which may be contributing to delirium secondary to their PNA. A drain was placed by neurosurg for non-communicating hydrocephalus in the setting of a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has new-onset hyponatremia in the setting of a ventriculostomy and D5NS overnight. There is concern for SIADH. Holding NS for now.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has known CAD s/p CABG in 2149, with DES in place. There is diffuse T wave inversions on EKG, which could be due to cardiac ischemia, cerebrovascular injury, or cardiomyopathy. The patient's systolic function is poor, and they have evidence of MR (mitral regurgitation).

   Imaging: [**8-26**] CXR:
   The fluctuating pattern of slight worsening and improvement over
   multiple serial chest radiographs is most likely due to superimposed
   pulmonary edema.  Increased confluent opacification in the right
   costophrenic angle suggests evolving pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is unchanged.
   [**8-26**] CXR:
   The graphic appearance of the chest is unchanged since 5:44 a.m., which
   showed generalized increased opacification in the lungs and new right
   pleural effusion most readily explained by pulmonary edema superimposed
   on the diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality which is the cause of
   recent respiratory failure. The heart is not enlarged, and there is no
   pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. Swan-Ganz
   catheter has been inserted through a right jugular introducer, but may
   loop in the ventricular outflow tract. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10393**] was paged.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2149. She has multiple comorbidities including severe peripheral vascular disease and systolic congestive heart failure. The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and respiratory failure, concerning pneumonia versus volume overload. She also has a scalp hematoma from a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage and is being treated for possible hydrocephalus. There is a concern for cardiac ischemia and worsening ST depressions on the EKG, but this is less likely given the chest X-ray findings and negative cardiac enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with worsening right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, and she is currently on assisted ventilation with pressure support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has sputum cultures positive for MRSA and Klebsiella, indicating a possible bacterial infection.
3. Volume Overload: Given her poor systolic function, there is concern for volume overload contributing to her respiratory failure.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has developed new-onset hyponatremia, which may be related to her ventriculostomy or D5NS overnight.
5. Cardiac Ischemia: There are worsening ST depressions on the EKG, but cardiac enzymes are negative.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. The patient's current condition is stable with controlled vital signs and improved oxygenation. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and central venous catheter use. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies is necessary to identify any signs of infection.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Daily chest X-rays and sputum cultures should be performed to monitor for any signs of infection.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheter use increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic anticoagulation should be continued, and periodic lower extremity venous Doppler studies may be considered.

4. Delirium: ICU admission and the use of sedatives and analgesics can contribute to delirium. Frequent neurological assessments and daily orientation are recommended to monitor cognitive function.

5. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation, which increases the risk of fluid overload. Daily weight measurements and monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) are important to assess fluid status.

   Imaging: [**8-26**] CXR:
   The fluctuating pattern of slight worsening and improvement over
   multiple serial chest radiographs is most likely due to superimposed
   pulmonary edema.  Increased confluent opacification in the right
   costophrenic angle suggests evolving pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is unchanged.
   [**8-26**] CXR:
   The graphic appearance of the chest is unchanged since 5:44 a.m., which
   showed generalized increased opacification in the lungs and new right
   pleural effusion most readily explained by pulmonary edema superimposed
   on the diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality which is the cause of
   recent respiratory failure. The heart is not enlarged, and there is no
   pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. Swan-Ganz
   catheter has been inserted through a right jugular introducer, but may
   loop in the ventricular outflow tract. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10393**] was paged.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and severe peripheral vascular disease. She presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely due to MRSA and Klebsiella. She also has worsening systolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status indicates a high risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has an active infection with MRSA and Klebsiella. Antibiotic coverage should be continued and reassessed based on culture results.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's systolic heart failure may worsen due to fluid overload and inadequate urine output. Diuretics should be continued to manage fluid balance.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to delirium or ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus. Neurological evaluation and consultation are recommended.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's recent development of hyponatremia should be closely monitored and corrected"

   Imaging: [**8-26**] CXR:
   The fluctuating pattern of slight worsening and improvement over
   multiple serial chest radiographs is most likely due to superimposed
   pulmonary edema.  Increased confluent opacification in the right
   costophrenic angle suggests evolving pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is unchanged.
   [**8-26**] CXR:
   The graphic appearance of the chest is unchanged since 5:44 a.m., which
   showed generalized increased opacification in the lungs and new right
   pleural effusion most readily explained by pulmonary edema superimposed
   on the diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality which is the cause of
   recent respiratory failure. The heart is not enlarged, and there is no
   pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. [**Month/Year (2) **]-Ganz

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and was transferred from another hospital with acute respiratory failure, suspected pneumonia (PNA) versus volume overload. The patient's recent medical history includes a subarachnoid hemorrhage, for which a ventriculostomy was placed, and a scalp hematoma.

Assessment:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has worsening right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, with sputum cultures positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Klebsiella. There is concern for worsening PNA versus acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pulmonary embolism (PE) and cardiac ischemia are also considered, but less likely.
2. Mental status: The patient is likely experiencing ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, which may contribute to delirium secondary to her PNA and hypoxemia. A drain was placed by neurosurgery for non-communicating hydrocephalus.
3. Scalp hematoma: The patient has a scalp hematoma that was re-dressed by neurosurgery, with no evidence of active bleed or infection.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient had a new onset of hyponat"

   Imaging: [**8-26**] CXR:
   The fluctuating pattern of slight worsening and improvement over
   multiple serial chest radiographs is most likely due to superimposed
   pulmonary edema.  Increased confluent opacification in the right
   costophrenic angle suggests evolving pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is unchanged.
   [**8-26**] CXR:
   The graphic appearance of the chest is unchanged since 5:44 a.m., which
   showed generalized increased opacification in the lungs and new right
   pleural effusion most readily explained by pulmonary edema superimposed
   on the diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality which is the cause of
   recent respiratory failure. The heart is not enlarged, and there is no
   pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. Swan-Ganz
   catheter has been inserted through a right jugular introducer, but may
   loop in the ventricular outflow tract. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10393**] was paged.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Appreciate ID/Pulm recs.  Pulm will
   re-evaluate pt once optimally diuresed for ?BAL at the end of the week
   if appropriate
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Most concerning for PNA
   and volume overload, however cannot r/o ARDS.
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support, will attempt to wean
   FiO2 today, have been unable to wean PEEP
   - Pt spiked again this AM, will re-culture and follow for growth
   - Continue lasix, will start gtt if needed to maintain UOP of 100
   ccs/hr
   -  albuterol and ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc, Meropenem for hx of MRSA and recent klebsiella in sputum
   - Continue Azithromycin for atypical coverage
   .
   # Mental status
 Likely [**12-31**] ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, may
   also be a component of delirium secondary to her PNA and hypoxemia.
   Drain placed by neuronsurg for non-communicating hydrocephalus in
   setting of recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.  CT head this AM stable.
   -no new neurosurg recs at this time.
   - try to wean down sedatives to examine neurologic function
   .
   # Scalp hematoma: Re-dressed by neurosurgery, no evidence of active
   bleed or infection.  If infected, pt covered by vanc, however wound
   culture showed sparse and rare growth coag negative Staph.
   -Continue wound care
   -Continue Vancomycin
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved, concern for SIADH in the setting of recent
   head injury.  Cortisol WNL.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CEs as necessary, particularly for diaphoretic episodes given that
   the patient is unable to articulate CP.   Will check AM CEs
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Neurosurgery comfortable with re-starting ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.
   Neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement.
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic Congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded.
   -Continue diuresis today with goal UOP of -100 ccs/hr
   - Continue Lisinopril, Carvedilol, hold for hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop o/n. Iron 49,
   Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
 anemia of chronic disease picture with
   extremely high ferritin.  Will not transfuse today given that she does
   not appear to have active ischemia.  Stat head CT today without new
   bleed, repeat HCt stable, T&S active.
   - follow daily Hct
   -guaiac stools
   .
   #  Multiple fractures seen on x-ray: Patient is scheduled to be seen in
   orthopedic clinic in [**2160-8-28**] here at [**Hospital1 19**].
   -d/c home fentanyl patch, as pt on Fentanyl drip
   .
   #  Depression: Continue prozac
   .
   #  Seizure prophylaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs,
   therapeutic dose.  EEG not required now as other etiologies more likely
   for AMS and on therapeutic Keppra.  Neuro signed off.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She also has severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and known systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure, and she is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/42 mmHg to 157/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 3 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) are 53/19 mmHg, and intracranial pressure (ICP) is 0 mmHg. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is 58%.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and volume overload, and there is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been receiving antibiotics for MRSA and klebsiella infections, as well as diuretics for fluid management. The patient's mental status is described as likely ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, possibly secondary to her recent subarachn"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She has a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and is currently tracheostomized since a car accident and with respiratory distress thought to be secondary to pneumonia (PNA) or volume overload. 

The patient has been unable to wean off the ventilator and has shown a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 26.1% to 22.2%. This could indicate ongoing blood loss or inadequate oxygenation. The patient also has multiple fractures seen on x-ray, for which she is scheduled to be seen in the orthopedic clinic. 

The patient's mental status is likely due to ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, possibly secondary to a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. A drain has been placed by neurosurgery for non-communicating hydrocephalus. 

The patient has several other medical conditions, including normocytic anemia, depression, and seizure prophylaxis with Kendra. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. The inability to wean off the ventilator suggests a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has sputum cultures positive for MRSA"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [2149]. She also has two drug-eluting stents (DES) in place, an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and known systolic heart failure. 

The patient presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and was transferred from the outside hospital with acute respiratory failure. The initial assessment suggests possible pneumonia versus volume overload. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA and klebsiella pneumonia, for which she is receiving appropriate antibiotics. There is also concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) and cardiac ischemia due to worsening ST depressions on EKG, although less likely given the chest X-ray findings and negative cardiac enzymes.

The patient has worsening right lower lobe infiltrate, and a chest CT scan has shown worsening effusions/infiltrate. A drain has been placed by neurosurgery for non-communicating hydrocephalus in the setting of a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient's mental status is likely due to ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, which may also be a component of delirium secondary to her pneumonia and hypoxemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Also suspect volume
   overload given her poor systolic function.  CXR this AM shows worsening
   RLL infiltrate.  Unclear etiology of her worsening resp status o/n,
   however concern for worsening pna vs ARDS.  Also concern for PE and
   cardiac ischemia given worsening ST depressions, however less likely
   given CXR findings and negative CEs.
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support.
   - Pt spiked this AM, will re-culture and follow for growth
   - Start lasix drip with goal of  at least 1L negative daily; goal
   100cc/hour urine output
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc, Meropenem for hx of MRSA and recent klebsiella in sputum
   - Continue Azithromycin for atypical coverage
   - ID consulted regarding worsening effusions/infiltrate on chest CT on
   current abx, recommend continuing [**Last Name (un) **]/Vanc
   - Pulm consult for ? bronch
 will re-evaluate pt once optimally
   diuresed for ?BAL at the end of the week if appropriate
   .
   # Mental status
 Likely [**12-31**] ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, may
   also be a component of delirium secondary to her PNA and hypoxemia.
   Drain placed by neuronsurg for non-communicating hydrocephalus in
   setting of recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.  CT head overnight stable
   hydrocephalus.
   - f/u neurosurg recs, appreciate input
   - try to wean down sedatives to examine neurologic function
   - f/u STAT head CT, concern for bleed d/t 4 point Hct drop
   .
   # Hct decrease by 4, but not far off from baseline
 stat head CT,
   repeat Hct, active t&s
   .
   # Scalp hematoma: Re-dressed by neurosurgery, no evidence of active
   bleed or infection.  If infected, pt covered by vanc, wound culture
   showed sparse and rare growth coag negative Staph.
   -Continue wound care
   -Continue Vancomycin
   .
   # Hyponatremia: New onset in setting of ventriculostomy and D5NS
   overnight, now resolved.  Unlikely SIADH, but cortisol level pending.
   -f/u cortisol level
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. This is unlikely in
   stent thrombosis given negative cardiac enzymes at OSH. Recent EKG
   concerning for worsening ST depressions, similar EKG findings with
   diaphoretic episode last night but negative CEs.
   - CEs as necessary, particularly for diaphoretic episodes.
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrioventricular block (AVB), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and known systolic heart failure. She presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and respiratory failure. The patient has a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and is on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's condition is complicated by multiple comorbidities, including pneumonia (PNA) with MRSA and klebsiella infections, worsening right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate, potential pulmonary embolism (PE), cardiac ischemia, hyponatremia, scalp hematoma, and normocytic anemia. She also has a history of depression and multiple fractures.

Medical interventions include administration of antibiotics, diuretics, bronchodilators, cardiac medications, and seizure prophylaxis. The patient is on a ventilator with pressure support, has an intra-arterial line, central venous pressure (CVP) catheter, arterial line, and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to worsening RLL infiltrate, positive sputum cultures for MRSA and klebsiella, and potential PE. Continuous monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, two drug-eluting stents, abdominal aortic aneurysm, severe peripheral vascular disease, and systolic heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and concern for pneumonia versus volume overload. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. Her recent sputum cultures have shown MRSA and Klebsiella pneumoniae. She has been diagnosed with a non-communicating hydrocephalus due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage and has had a drain placed by neurosurgery. Her mental status is likely due to ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, as well as possible delirium secondary to her pneumonia and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to her prolonged intubation and the presence of MRSA and Klebsiella pneumoniae in her sputum cultures, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures such as elevating the head of the bed, bronchoscopic hygiene, and regular re-culture should be taken to prevent this complication.

2. Drug-resistant infection: The patient's recent sputum cultures have shown MRSA and Klebsiella pneumoniae, indicating a possible drug-resistant infection. It is important to monitor her response to antibiotics and consider additional coverage with agents like"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and placement of drug-eluting stents (DES). She also has severe peripheral vascular disease and known systolic heart failure. The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure. She was transferred from another hospital with pneumonia (PNA) versus volume overload. She has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and klebsiella on recent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a concern due to her recent diagnosis of VAP and klebsiella infection. There is also a possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) given her low oxygen levels and inability to wean off the ventilator.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with PNA and VAP, indicating a persistent infection in the lungs. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient initially had hyponatremia, which has since resolved. However, there is a concern for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in the setting of her recent head injury.
4. Scalp hematoma: The patient has a scalp"

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 2149 and has two drug-eluting stents in place. She also has an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and known systolic heart failure. The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and was transferred from an outside hospital with acute respiratory failure, raising concerns for pneumonia versus volume overload. 

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and is currently on assisted ventilation with pressure support. There is ongoing concern for pneumonia, as sputum cultures have grown MRSA and klebsiella. The patient is receiving vancomycin and meropenem for MRSA and recent klebsiella in sputum. Azithromycin has been started for atypical coverage.

The patient's blood pressure has been in the 80s systolic, leading to holding the lasix drip overnight and restarting levophed. The patient's urine output has decreased as a result. Diarrhea was reported overnight.

The patient's fever is being investigated, with consideration given to pneumonia as the most likely source. Drug fever is also a concern, and further stool cultures are being obtained. A CT torso has been ordered.

The patient has a history of CAD with CABG, DES placement, AAA, severe PVD, and known systolic HF. Coronary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD). She presents with chest pain and shortness of breath, transferred from outside hospital with acute respiratory failure. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has known systolic heart failure and presents with concerns for pneumonia versus volume overload. The patient is also diagnosed with normocytic anemia, likely due to chronic disease, and has extremely high ferritin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and there is a concern for pneumonia. Klebsiella has been identified in her sputum culture. Antibiotics have been initiated, but the patient remains febrile, suggesting that the pneumonia may not be responding to treatment. There is a concern for vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia, and consideration is being given to adding linezolid to the antibiotic regimen.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's respiratory failure could progress to ARDS, a severe form of lung injury characterized by diffuse alveolar damage. The patient's current condition does not rule out ARDS, and close monitoring is necessary.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD and previous CABG. Her systolic congestive heart failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Appreciate ID/Pulm recs.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support, will attempt to wean
   FiO2 yet again today (although unsuccessful due to desats x2 days now)
   - Pt spiked again yesterday, will re-culture daily and follow for
   growth
   - CXR today
   - Continue lasix drip with goal: 100 ccs/hr, as tolerated by BP
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc (started [**8-21**]), Meropenem (started [**8-23**]) for hx of MRSA and
   recent klebsiella in sputum
   - Today is last day of 5-day course of Azithromycin (started [**8-26**]) for
   atypical coverage
   .
   # Fevers
 considering pneumonia as most likely source thus far (no
   significant change to LFT
s over past week, CSF without significant
   growth)
   - Concern for vanco-resistant s.aureus pneumonia; re-consult ID re:
   addition of linezolid to antibiotic regimen
   - CT torso to find potential source for fevers (with IV and PO
   contrast)
   - U/S thorax to examine if pleural effusions could be tapped as
   potential infectious source
   - Repeat sputum culture, per pulm
   - Consider drug fever
   - F/u stool for c.diff
   - F/u blood and urine cultures

   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CE
s as necessary, particularly for diaphoretic episodes given that
   the patient is unable to articulate CP.
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Neurosurgery comfortable with re-starting ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement.
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded. Did not meet diuresis goal yesterday due to lower BP that
   prohibited giving lasix and actually meant patient went back onto
   levophed now (but being weaned back down).
   - Diuresis today trailing off, with goal UOP of even to (-)500cc/day
   - Continue Lisinopril, Carvedilol, hold for hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop recently. Iron 49,
   Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
 anemia of chronic disease picture with
   extremely high ferritin.  Will not transfuse today given that she does
   not appear to have active ischemia.
   - maintain active T&S
   - follow daily Hct
   - guaiac stools

   # Mental status
 Likely [**12-31**] ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, may
   also be a component of delirium secondary to her PNA and hypoxemia.
   Drain placed by neurosurgery for non-communicating hydrocephalus in
   setting of recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Most recent CT head stable.

   ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10453**] today and I concur with
   the history, physical examination, assessment and treatment plan.   My
   examination is consistent with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10453**]
s examination.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 9447**]
   is a 70 year old women who is well known to the CCU due to a prolonged
   hospitalization following a motor vehicle accident complicated an
   intracranial hemorrhage, prolonged ventilatory dependence, fever of
   unknown origin, anemia, and known coronary artery disease.  She is
   being followed by both pulmonary and infectious disease services.   We
   will plan reculture of the MRSA sputum samples to assess drug
   resistance and look for occult sources of an abscess.   Her prognosis
   for long-term recovery remains uncertain.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently on ventilatory support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, blood pressure ranging from 122/47 to 153/58 mmHg, heart rate between 75 and 95 bpm, respiratory rate at 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on 50% FiO2. The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 196 K/uL, elevated lactate levels at 26 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 135 mEq/L. The patient's renal function is impaired with an elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL and a decreased glomerular filtration rate. The patient's liver enzymes are within normal limits, and her hemoglobin level is slightly low at 7.2 g/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals a new systolic murmur along with crackles in the lungs. The patient's neurological status is deteriorating, with grimacing to painful stimuli and no movement or tracking to verbal stimuli. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current concerns include respiratory failure, potential pneumonia, and se"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and placement of drug-eluting stents (DES) in two vessels. She also has an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), along with known systolic heart failure (HF).

The patient presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure, which led to her transfer from another hospital. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. The initial concern was pneumonia versus volume overload, but now it is most concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, and the source has not been determined yet. There is a concern for vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and the ID team has been consulted regarding the addition of linezolid to the antibiotic regimen. A CT torso has been ordered to find potential sources of infection, and an ultrasound of the thorax will be performed to examine if pleural effusions could be tapped as a potential infectious source.

The patient's coronary anatomy includes a left internal mammary artery graft to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery, and saphenous vein graft-omental distribution. There are chronic ST depressions, but they do not appear to be significantly worse during this"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Appreciate ID/Pulm recs.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.   CT prelim read
   indicates infectious vs. inflammatory.  Mini BAL results pending.
   - f/u final CT read.
   - Consider adding Bactrim to cover PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Continue AC ventilation with pressure support, will attempt to wean
   FiO2 yet again today (although unsuccessful due to desats x2 days now),
   switch to pressure support if pt over-breathing vent
   - Pt spiked again yesterday, will re-culture daily and follow for
   growth
   - CXR today
   - Continue lasix drip with goal: 100 ccs/hr, as tolerated by BP, goal
   even-negative 500cc.
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc (started [**8-21**]), Meropenem (started [**8-23**]) for hx of MRSA and
   recent klebsiella in sputum
   - Will consider adding bactrim for PCP coverage, will arrange
   multi-disp meeting with pulm and ID tomorrow
   .
   # Fevers
 considering pneumonia as most likely source thus far (no
   significant change to LFT
s over past week, CSF without significant
   growth)
   - Concern for vanco-resistant s.aureus pneumonia; re-consult ID re:
   addition of linezolid to antibiotic regimen
   - CT torso to find potential source for fevers (with IV and PO
   contrast)
   - U/S thorax to examine if pleural effusions could be tapped as
   potential infectious source
   - Repeat sputum culture, per pulm
   - Consider drug fever
   - F/u stool for c.diff
   - F/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CE
s as necessary, particularly for diaphoretic episodes given that
   the patient is unable to articulate CP.
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Neurosurgery comfortable with re-starting ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement.
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded. Did not meet diuresis goal yesterday due to lower BP that
   prohibited giving lasix and actually meant patient went back onto
   levophed now (but being weaned back down).
   - Diuresis today trailing off, with goal UOP of even to (-)500cc/day
   - Continue Lisinopril, Carvedilol, hold for hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop recently. Iron 49,
   Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
 anemia of chronic disease picture with
   extremely high ferritin.  Will not transfuse today given that she does
   not appear to have active ischemia.
   - maintain active T&S
   - follow daily Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Mental status
 Likely [**12-31**] ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, may
   also be a component of delirium secondary to her PNA and hypoxemia.
   Drain placed by neurosurgery for non-communicating hydrocephalus in
   setting of recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Most recent CT head stable.
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
   .
   # Scalp hematoma: Re-dressed by neurosurgery, no evidence of active
   bleed or infection.  If infected, pt covered by vanc, however wound
   culture showed sparse and rare growth coag negative Staph.
   -Continue wound care
   -Continue Vancomycin.
   .
   #  Multiple fractures seen on x-ray: Patient is scheduled to be seen in
   orthopedic clinic in [**2160-8-28**] here at [**Hospital1 19**].
   -d/c home fentanyl patch, as pt on Fentanyl drip
   .
   #  Depression: Continue prozac
   .
   #  Seizure prophylaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs,
   therapeutic dose.  EEG not required now as other etiologies more likely
   for AMS and on therapeutic Keppra.  Neuro signed off.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and requires mechanical ventilation. The presence of sputum culture positive for MRSA and klebsiella indicates a possible bacterial infection, which could lead to pneumonia or an infected pleural effusion.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated with antibiotics for MRSA and klebsiella, indicating a concern for pneumonia. The CT scan shows diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacity and interlobular septal thickening, which can be seen in cases of pneumonia.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous CABG surgery puts them at risk for cardiac complications. The mention of chronic ST depressions on ECG suggests possible coronary artery disease.

4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's systolic congestive heart failure is evident from the echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. The presence of 2+ mitral regurgitation (MR) also suggests CHF.

5. Anemia: The patient has a normocytic anemia with a stable hematocrit level but with a recent critical drop in hemoglobin. The extremely high ferritin level suggests anemia of chronic disease.

6. Scalp Hematoma: The patient has a scalp hematoma that was redressed by neuros"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. She has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and concern for pneumonia versus volume overload versus acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has multiple comorbidities including severe peripheral vascular disease, known systolic heart failure, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/48 to 152/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacity and interlobular septal thickening on CT chest, with mild improvement in the basilar confluent opacification and bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support, and attempts have been made to wean FiO2 due to desaturation. She is also receiving IV Lasix for fluid management, as well as antibiotics for suspected MRSA and klebsiella pneumonia. There are concerns about vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, and consideration is being"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia twice, once with MRSA and recently with klebsiella. The fevers and positive sputum cultures indicate ongoing infection, and the patient remains on antibiotics. There is also concern for vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, and although they have been weaned off the ventilator, they continue to require supplemental oxygen. The ongoing difficulty in weaning off the ventilator suggests a risk of respiratory failure.

3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. There is concern for systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) due to reduced ejection fraction (EF) and mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient's current volume overload and diuretic requirements indicate ongoing cardiac dysfunction.

4. Neurological complications: The patient has a likely ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, which may be contributing to altered mental status. There is also a scalp hematoma that needs to be monitored for infection.

5. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia with a stable hematocrit but a recent critical drop in hemoglobin. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Appreciate ID/Pulm recs.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support, will attempt to wean
   FiO2 yet again today (although unsuccessful due to desats x2 days now)
   - Pt spiked again yesterday, will re-culture daily and follow for
   growth
   - CXR today
   - Continue lasix drip with goal: 100 ccs/hr, as tolerated by BP
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc (started [**8-21**]), Meropenem (started [**8-23**]) for hx of MRSA and
   recent klebsiella in sputum
   - Today is last day of 5-day course of Azithromycin (started [**8-26**]) for
   atypical coverage
   .
   # Fevers
 considering pneumonia as most likely source thus far (no
   significant change to LFT
s over past week, CSF without significant
   growth)
   - Concern for vanco-resistant s.aureus pneumonia; re-consult ID re:
   addition of linezolid to antibiotic regimen
   - CT torso to find potential source for fevers (with IV and PO
   contrast)
   - U/S thorax to examine if pleural effusions could be tapped as
   potential infectious source
   - Repeat sputum culture, per pulm
   - Consider drug fever
   - F/u stool for c.diff
   - F/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CE
s as necessary, particularly for diaphoretic episodes given that
   the patient is unable to articulate CP.
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Neurosurgery comfortable with re-starting ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement.
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded. Did not meet diuresis goal yesterday due to lower BP that
   prohibited giving lasix and actually meant patient went back onto
   levophed now (but being weaned back down).
   - Diuresis today trailing off, with goal UOP of even to (-)500cc/day
   - Continue Lisinopril, Carvedilol, hold for hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop recently. Iron 49,
   Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
 anemia of chronic disease picture with
   extremely high ferritin.  Will not transfuse today given that she does
   not appear to have active ischemia.
   - maintain active T&S
   - follow daily Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Mental status
 Likely [**12-31**] ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, may
   also be a component of delirium secondary to her PNA and hypoxemia.
   Drain placed by neurosurgery for non-communicating hydrocephalus in
   setting of recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Most recent CT head stable.
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
   .
   # Scalp hematoma: Re-dressed by neurosurgery, no evidence of active
   bleed or infection.  If infected, pt covered by vanc, however wound
   culture showed sparse and rare growth coag negative Staph.
   -Continue wound care
   -Continue Vancomycin.
   .
   #  Multiple fractures seen on x-ray: Patient is scheduled to be seen in
   orthopedic clinic in [**2160-8-28**] here at [**Hospital1 19**].
   -d/c home fentanyl patch, as pt on Fentanyl drip
   .
   #  Depression: Continue prozac
   .
   #  Seizure prophylaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs,
   therapeutic dose.  EEG not required now as other etiologies more likely
   for AMS and on therapeutic Keppra.  Neuro signed off.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Appreciate ID/Pulm recs.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.   CT prelim read
   indicates infectious vs. inflammatory, f/u final CT read.
   - Consider adding Bactrim to cover PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u final CT read
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support, will attempt to wean
   FiO2 yet again today (although unsuccessful due to desats x2 days now)
   - Pt spiked again yesterday, will re-culture daily and follow for
   growth
   - CXR today
   - Continue lasix drip with goal: 100 ccs/hr, as tolerated by BP, goal
   even-negative 500cc.
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc (started [**8-21**]), Meropenem (started [**8-23**]) for hx of MRSA and
   recent klebsiella in sputum
   - Today ([**8-30**]) is last day of 5-day course of Azithromycin (started
   [**8-26**]) for atypical coverage
   .
   # Fevers
 considering pneumonia as most likely source thus far (no
   significant change to LFT
s over past week, CSF without significant
   growth)
   - Concern for vanco-resistant s.aureus pneumonia; re-consult ID re:
   addition of linezolid to antibiotic regimen
   - CT torso to find potential source for fevers (with IV and PO
   contrast)
   - U/S thorax to examine if pleural effusions could be tapped as
   potential infectious source
   - Repeat sputum culture, per pulm
   - Consider drug fever
   - F/u stool for c.diff
   - F/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CE
s as necessary, particularly for diaphoretic episodes given that
   the patient is unable to articulate CP.
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Neurosurgery comfortable with re-starting ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement.
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded. Did not meet diuresis goal yesterday due to lower BP that
   prohibited giving lasix and actually meant patient went back onto
   levophed now (but being weaned back down).
   - Diuresis today trailing off, with goal UOP of even to (-)500cc/day
   - Continue Lisinopril, Carvedilol, hold for hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop recently. Iron 49,
   Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
 anemia of chronic disease picture with
   extremely high ferritin.  Will not transfuse today given that she does
   not appear to have active ischemia.
   - maintain active T&S
   - follow daily Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Mental status
 Likely [**12-31**] ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus, may
   also be a component of delirium secondary to her PNA and hypoxemia.
   Drain placed by neurosurgery for non-communicating hydrocephalus in
   setting of recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Most recent CT head stable.

   # Scalp hematoma: Re-dressed by neurosurgery, no evidence of active
   bleed or infection.  If infected, pt covered by vanc, however wound
   culture showed sparse and rare growth coag negative Staph.
   -Continue wound care
   -Continue Vancomycin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), two drug-eluting stents (DES) in place, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and known systolic heart failure. She presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure, transferred from another hospital with suspected pneumonia versus volume overload. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 119/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 2 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and fever suggest the possibility of pneumonia. The presence of klebsiella in the recent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and positive sputum cultures for MRSA and klebsiella indicate an ongoing infection. Antibiotics have been initiated, but considering the resistance patterns, additional coverage may be necessary. Imaging studies such as a CT scan of the chest are recommended to identify the source of infection.

2. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD,"

   Radiology:
   Chest CT - Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacity and interlobular
   septal thickening is slightly improved. Extensive mediastinal
   adenopathy may be reactive to the inflammatory and infectious process
   involving the lungs.
   CXR [**8-31**]: The diffuse interstitial and ground-glass pulmonary
   abnormality seen on chest CT on [**8-26**] has been subsequently
   stable. Heart is not particularly enlarged and pleural effusion, if
   any, is small and unchanged. Tracheostomy
   tube is in standard placement, left jugular line ends low in the SVC.
   Right jugular sheath and Swan-Ganz catheter have been removed. No
   pneumothorax.
   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Patient with mental status change
   this morning.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.   CT read indicates
   infectious vs. inflammatory.
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support, will attempt to wean
   FiO2 yet again today, switch to pressure support if pt over-breathing
   vent
   - Continue lasix drip, as tolerated by BP, goal even to negative 500cc.
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc (started [**8-21**]), Meropenem (started [**8-23**]) for hx of MRSA and
   recent klebsiella in sputum
   - Will consider adding bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 10504**] (although negative on
   mini-BAL), will arrange multi-disciplinary meeting with pulm and ID
   tomorrow
   .
   # Fevers
 considering pneumonia as most likely source thus far (no
   significant change to LFT
s over past week, CSF without significant
   growth)
   - Concern for vanco-resistant s.aureus pneumonia; re-consult ID re:
   addition of linezolid to antibiotic regimen
   - F/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Mental status
 Acute change this morning with decreased response to
   pain and not moving extremities. Likely contributors include:
   ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, delirium secondary to PNA and
   hypoxemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
   - f/u stat head CT
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CE
s as necessary if clinically indicated
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Continue ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement.
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded. Did not meet diuresis goal yesterday due to lower BP that
   prohibited giving lasix and actually meant patient went back onto
   levophed now (but being weaned back down).
   - Diuresis today trailing off, with goal UOP of even to (-)500cc/day
   - Continue Lisinopril, Carvedilol, hold for hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop on [**8-27**].
   Iron 49, Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
 anemia of chronic disease picture
   with extremely high ferritin.  Will not transfuse today given that she
   does not appear to have active ischemia; Hct stable in 22 range.
   - maintain active T&S
   - follow daily Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Scalp hematoma: Re-dressed by neurosurgery, no evidence of active
   bleed or infection.  If infected, pt covered by vanc, however wound
   culture showed sparse and rare growth coag negative Staph.
   -Continue wound care
   -Continue Vancomycin.
   .
   #  Multiple fractures seen on x-ray: Patient is scheduled to be seen in
   orthopedic clinic in [**2160-8-28**] here at [**Hospital1 19**].
   -d/c home fentanyl patch, as pt on Fentanyl drip
   .
   #  Depression: Continue prozac
   .
   #  Seizure prophylaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs. EEG
   not required now as other etiologies more likely for AMS and on
   therapeutic Keppra.  Neuro signed off.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved, originally with concern for SIADH in the
   setting of recent head injury.  Cortisol WNL

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and severe peripheral vascular disease. She presents with acute respiratory failure, shortness of breath, and chest pain. She was transferred from an outside hospital and is now in the ICU with mental status changes. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem. Her vital signs are stable, but she is still experiencing fevers. The patient has a history of systolic heart failure and has had a recent echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction of 35%. She also has chronic anemia with a hematocrit level of 22.1%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk for respiratory complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which may lead to further respiratory distress and potential sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG, and systolic heart failure, there is a risk of cardiac-related issues such as heart failure exacerbation or arrhythmias.
4. Delirium: The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to delirium, which may require close monitoring and management.
5. Hyponatremia: Although resolved, the patient had hyponatremia"

   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.   CT read indicates
   infectious vs. inflammatory.
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support
   - Goal I&O: even to negative 500cc.; lasix prn to achieve goal
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc (started [**8-21**]), Meropenem (started [**8-23**]) for hx of MRSA and
   recent klebsiella in sputum
   - Will consider adding bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 10504**] (although negative on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and stenting in two arteries. She also has severe peripheral vascular disease and known systolic heart failure. The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure. She was transferred from an outside hospital with suspected pneumonia versus volume overload. On admission, she had mental status changes and sputum cultures positive for MRSA and klebsiella. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and receiving antibiotics for MRSA and klebsiella. The patient has diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacity and interlobular septal thickening on chest CT, which has slightly improved. Extensive mediastinal adenopathy may be reactive to the inflammatory and infectious process involving the lungs. There are no significant changes in liver function tests over the past week, and cerebrospinal fluid without significant growth. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to pneumonia or an infected effusion, as indicated by the presence of klebsiella in recent BAL and sputum cultures positive for MRSA. The CT scan indicates an infectious process rather than an inflammatory one.
2. Fevers: The patient's fevers may be related to the suspected pneumonia, as no significant change in liver function tests was observed over the past week, and CSF without"

   Radiology:
   Chest CT - Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacity and interlobular
   septal thickening is slightly improved. Extensive mediastinal
   adenopathy may be reactive to the inflammatory and infectious process
   involving the lungs.
   CXR [**8-31**]: The diffuse interstitial and ground-glass pulmonary
   abnormality seen on chest CT on [**8-26**] has been subsequently
   stable. Heart is not particularly enlarged and pleural effusion, if
   any, is small and unchanged. Tracheostomy
   tube is in standard placement, left jugular line ends low in the SVC.
   Right jugular sheath and Swan-Ganz catheter have been removed. No
   pneumothorax.
   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Patient with mental status change
   this morning.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.   CT read indicates
   infectious vs. inflammatory.
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support, will attempt to wean
   FiO2 yet again today, switch to pressure support if pt over-breathing
   vent
   - Continue lasix drip, as tolerated by BP, goal even to negative 500cc.
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc (started [**8-21**]), Meropenem (started [**8-23**]) for hx of MRSA and
   recent klebsiella in sputum
   - Will consider adding bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 10504**] (although negative on
   mini-BAL), will arrange multi-disciplinary meeting with pulm and ID
   tomorrow
   .
   # Fevers
 considering pneumonia as most likely source thus far (no
   significant change to LFT
s over past week, CSF without significant
   growth)
   - Concern for vanco-resistant s.aureus pneumonia; re-consult ID re:
   addition of linezolid to antibiotic regimen
   - F/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Mental status
 Acute change this morning with decreased response to
   pain and not moving extremities. Likely contributors include:
   ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, delirium secondary to PNA and
   hypoxemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
   - f/u stat head CT
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CE
s as necessary if clinically indicated
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Continue ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement.
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded. Did not meet diuresis goal yesterday due to lower BP that
   prohibited giving lasix and actually meant patient went back onto
   levophed now (but being weaned back down).
   - Diuresis today trailing off, with goal UOP of even to (-)500cc/day
   - Continue Lisinopril, Carvedilol, hold for hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop on [**8-27**].
   Iron 49, Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
 anemia of chronic disease picture
   with extremely high ferritin.  Will not transfuse today given that she
   does not appear to have active ischemia; Hct stable in 22 range.
   - maintain active T&S
   - follow daily Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Scalp hematoma: Re-dressed by neurosurgery, no evidence of active
   bleed or infection.  If infected, pt covered by vanc, however wound
   culture showed sparse and rare growth coag negative Staph.
   -Continue wound care
   -Continue Vancomycin.
   .
   #  Multiple fractures seen on x-ray: Patient is scheduled to be seen in
   orthopedic clinic in [**2160-8-28**] here at [**Hospital1 19**].
   -d/c home fentanyl patch, as pt on Fentanyl drip
   .
   #  Depression: Continue prozac
   .
   #  Seizure prophylaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs. EEG
   not required now as other etiologies more likely for AMS and on
   therapeutic Keppra.  Neuro signed off.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved, originally with concern for SIADH in the
   setting of recent head injury.  Cortisol WNL

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic aneurysm (AAA), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and known systolic heart failure. She presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure, transferred from an outside hospital. The patient's mental status changed this morning, and she is unresponsive to painful stimuli and not moving her extremities. She has been panned cultured, and neurosurgery has been notified. A stat head CT has been ordered. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics for suspected MRSA and klebsiella pneumonia, diuretics for volume overload, bronchodilators for shortness of breath, and cardiac medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on assisted ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for pneumonia or infected effusion as the cause of respiratory distress.
2. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and pneumonia is considered the most likely source. There is also a concern for vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.
3. Mental status change: The patient has experienced an acute change in mental status with decreased response to pain and immobility. Possible contributors include ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, delirium secondary to PNA"

   ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the Progress Note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10453**] today and I concur with
   the history, physical examination, assessment and treatment plan.
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 9447**] is a 70 year old women who is well known to the CCU due to
   a prolonged hospitalization following a motor vehicle accident
   complicated an intracranial hemorrhage, prolonged ventilatory
   dependence, fever of unknown origin, anemia, and known coronary artery
   disease.  She is being followed by both pulmonary and infectious
   disease services.
   Her fevers and ventilatory requirements are slightly improved, but she
   remains critically ill.
   We have asked pulmonary to evaluate the need for bronchoscopy is an
   effort to exclude other infectious or inflammatory processes.
   Her prognosis for long-term recovery remains uncertain.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previously treated with CABG, AAA, severe peripheral vascular disease, and known systolic heart failure. She presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure, transferred from an outside hospital. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and septic shock, and her condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires ventilatory support. There is a concern for pneumonia or infected effusion, and the ongoing need for mechanical ventilation poses a risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA and klebsiella pneumonia, and there is a concern for vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) pneumonia. Additionally, the patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which may lead to antibiotic-associated complications such as Clostridium difficile infection.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure, and her current condition suggests acute decompensated heart failure. There is a concern for volume overload, and diuresis has been initiated to manage this issue.
4. Mental Status Changes: The patient has experienced acute mental status changes with decreased response to pain and immobility of extremities. Possible causes include ventriculomegaly"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   CT - no significant change (head)
   In the afternoon, temp up to 100.6.
   Hypotensive to 70s in the afternoon, put back on levophed and give 2x
   250cc bolus (SBP response = up to 90s).
   As a result, pulm deferred BAL/bronchoscopy to when patient
   hemodynamically stable and off of levophed - they are unclear what the

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Patient with mental status change
   this morning.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.   CT read indicates
   infectious vs. inflammatory.
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support
   - Goal I&O: even to negative 500cc.; lasix prn to achieve goal
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc (started [**8-21**]), Meropenem (started [**8-23**]) for hx of MRSA and
   recent klebsiella in sputum
   - per pharmacy changed vanc from 750mg q12h to 1250mg daily. check
   vanco trough [**9-4**] (Thursday) morning before [**9-4**]
s AM dose
   - Will consider adding bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 10504**] (although negative on
   mini-BAL)
   - Arrange multi-disciplinary meeting with pulm and ID today regarding
   lung disease and inability to wean off of the vent
   -hopefully bronch/BAL today if hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Fevers
 considering pneumonia as most likely source thus far (no
   significant change to LFT
s over past week, CSF without significant
   growth, negative mini-BAL)
   - Concern for vanco-resistant s.aureus pneumonia; re-consult ID re:
   addition of linezolid to antibiotic regimen
   - F/u blood and urine cultures
   - Diarrhea decreasing, but resend c.diff nonetheless
   .
   # Mental status
 Acute change this morning with decreased response to
   pain and not moving extremities. Likely contributors include:
   ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, delirium secondary to PNA and
   hypoxemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CE
s as necessary if clinically indicated
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Continue ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement.
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded. Did not meet diuresis goal yesterday due to lower BP that
   prohibited giving lasix and actually meant patient went back onto
   levophed now (but being weaned back down).
   - Diuresis today trailing off, with goal UOP of even to (-)500cc/day
   - Continue Lisinopril, Carvedilol, hold for hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop on [**8-27**].
   Iron 49, Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
 anemia of chronic disease picture
   with extremely high ferritin.  Will not transfuse today given that she
   does not appear to have active ischemia; Hct stable in 22 range.
   - maintain active T&S
   - follow daily Hct
   - guaiac stools
   .
   # Scalp hematoma: Re-dressed by neurosurgery, no evidence of active
   bleed or infection.  If infected, pt covered by vanc, however wound
   culture showed sparse and rare growth coag negative Staph.
   -Continue wound care
   -Continue Vancomycin.
   .
   #  Multiple fractures seen on x-ray:
   - Fentanyl drip covering
   .
   #  Depression: Continue prozac
   .
   #  Seizure prophylaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs. EEG
   not required now as other etiologies more likely for AMS and on
   therapeutic Keppra.  Neuro signed off.

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [**2149**]. She also has two drug-eluting stents (DES) in place, an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and known systolic heart failure (HF). The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure, transferred from another hospital. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with pneumonia or an infected effusion, as indicated by positive sputum cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at the outside hospital and klebsiella on recent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Her mental status changed this morning, showing decreased response to pain and not moving extremities. There are multiple potential causes for the mental status change, including ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, delirium secondary to pneumonia and hypoxemia, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. 

The patient has known CAD with previous CABG surgery and DES placement. However, her recent echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, indicating an improvement from 20% one month prior. She also has 2+ mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient appears to be volume overloaded and did not meet diures"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been in the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, reaching a maximum of 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon.
- Blood pressure has been consistently low, requiring the use of levophed to maintain stable blood pressure levels.
- The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist and autoflow modes, set tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.27, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 238 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 74 mmHg.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 251 K/uL, low platelet count (Plt) of 200 K/uL, high creatinine (Cr) level of 0.5 mg/dL, elevated troponin-T level of 17 ng/mL, and elevated lactate level of 0.7 mmol/L.
- The patient has impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, airway clearance, arousal, attention, cognition, balance, gait, motor function, knowledge, transfers, and ventilatory forces and flow.
- The patient also has hyperglycemia, electrolyte & fluid disorder, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), fever, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status (not delirium), heart failure (systolic, acute on chronic), and respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS).
- The patient has been receiving various ICU care interventions, including nutrition, glycemic control, arterial line, ICP catheter, and multi-lumen lines.
- Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) have been implemented.
- The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the provided information include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated WBC count, and high lactate levels suggest the possibility of an infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Although the patient's respiratory failure is mentioned as acute and not ARDS, the low PaO2/FiO2 ratio and the use of high PEEP indicate a risk for ARDS development.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart failure (systolic, acute on chronic) and low blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium due to various factors such as infection, medication, or other underlying conditions.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and risk factors may predispose them to DVT formation.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, respiratory support, and risk factors may increase the risk of pneumonia development.
7. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels require close monitoring to prevent complications related to fluid and electrolyte disorders.

It is important to note that the provided information is a summary, and a thorough evaluation of the patient's medical history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic tests would be necessary to determine the exact medical complications that may arise."

   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Patient with mental status change
   this morning.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.   CT read indicates
   infectious vs. inflammatory.
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support
   - Goal I&O: even to negative 500cc.; lasix prn to achieve goal
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc (started [**8-21**]), Meropenem (started [**8-23**]) for hx of MRSA and
   recent klebsiella in sputum
   - per pharmacy changed vanc from 750mg q12h to 1250mg daily. check
   vanco trough [**9-4**] (Thursday) morning before [**9-4**]

 considering pneumonia as most likely source thus far (no
   significant change to LFT
s over past week, CSF without significant
   growth, negative mini-BAL)
   - Concern for vanco-resistant s.aureus pneumonia; re-consult ID re:
   addition of linezolid to antibiotic regimen
   - F/u blood and urine cultures
   - Diarrhea decreasing, but resend c.diff nonetheless
   .
   # Mental status
 Acute change this morning with decreased response to
   pain and not moving extremities. Likely contributors include:
   ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, delirium secondary to PNA and
   hypoxemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
   - f/u cultures

   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CE
s as necessary if clinically indicated
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Continue ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement.

   # PUMP:  Systolic congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded. Did not meet diuresis goal yesterday due to lower BP that
   prohibited giving lasix and actually meant patient went back onto
   levophed now (but being weaned back down).
   - Diuresis today trailing off, with goal UOP of even to (-)500cc/day
   - Continue Lisinopril, Carvedilol, hold for hypotension

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and placement of two drug-eluting stents (DES) in [**2159**]. She also has severe peripheral vascular disease and known systolic heart failure. The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure. She was transferred from an outside hospital with suspected pneumonia versus volume overload. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has sputum cultures positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at the outside hospital, and now with klebsiella on recent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). She is being ventilated with pressure support and is receiving vancomycin and meropenem for her history of MRSA and recent klebsiella infection. The goal is to achieve even intake and output with lasix as needed, albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers for shortness of breath, and consideration for adding trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), although the mini-BAL was negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Having tremendous difficulty
   weaning patient off of the ventilator due to desat
s and/or hypotensive
   episodes when try to alter physiology.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.   CT read indicates
   infectious vs. inflammatory. Concern for pneumopericardium (potentially
   from tracheostomy site, prior CABG, mediastinitis). Patient academic
   with increased CO2 retained on ABG this morning, unclear reason why
   (perhaps infection, over-diuresis, hypotension):
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support, monitor newly
   increased RR and TV
   - Goal I&O: even today; lasix 60mg [**Hospital1 **] and then additional prn to
   achieve goal
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc (started [**8-21**]) for hx of MRSA and recent klebsiella in
   sputum
   - per pharmacy, changed vanc dose from 750mg q12h to 1250mg daily
   - check vanco trough [**9-4**] (Thursday) morning before [**9-4**]
s AM dose
   - discontinue Meropenem following today
s doses (started [**8-23**]) as today
   is day #[**9-6**]
   - arrange multi-disciplinary meeting with pulm and ID today regarding
   lung disease and inability to wean off of the vent
   - f/u bronch/BAL today
   - echo today, focused on pedicardial region
   - CT chest today
   - f/u ABG this AM
   - d/c diamox now that significant diuresis completed and now that
   patient academic this morning
   .
   # Fevers
 considering pneumonia as most likely source thus far (no
   significant change to LFT
s over past week, CSF without significant
   growth, negative mini-BAL, no obvious skin wounds, c.diff negative)
   - Concern for vanco-resistant s.aureus pneumonia; re-consult ID re:
   addition of linezolid to antibiotic regimen
   - F/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Mental status
 Stable over past 24 hours grossly, following acute
   change yesterday morning with decreased response to pain and not moving
   extremities. Likely contributors include: ventriculomegaly,
   hydrocephalus, delirium secondary to PNA and hypoxemia, subarachnoid
   hemorrhage.
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CE
s as necessary if clinically indicated
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Continue ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded. Balancing between diuresis, hypotension, and overdiuresis.
   - Goal even I
s & O
s today; Lasix 60mg [**Hospital1 **] and prn if needed to
   achieve this goal
   - Continue Lisinopril, Carvedilol, hold for hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop on [**8-27**].
   Iron 49, Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
 anemia of chronic disease picture
   with extremely high ferritin.  Will not transfuse today given that she
   does not appear to have active ischemia; Hct stable in 22 range.
   - maintain active T&S
   - follow daily Hct
   .
   # Scalp hematoma: Re-dressed by neurosurgery, no evidence of active
   bleed or infection.  If infected, pt covered by vanc, however wound
   culture showed sparse and rare growth coag negative Staph.
   -Continue wound care
   -Continue Vancomycin.
   .
   #  Multiple fractures seen on x-ray:
   - Fentanyl drip covering
   .
   #  Depression: Continue prozac
   .
   #  Seizure prophylaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs. EEG
   not required now as other etiologies more likely for AMS and on
   therapeutic Keppra.  Neuro signed off.

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the past. She also has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), known systolic heart failure (HF), and is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, suspected pneumonia versus volume overload. The patient has been experiencing difficulty weaning off the ventilator, and there is concern for a pneumopericardium.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.6°F, blood pressure ranging from 70s to 90s mmHg, heart rate of 68 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, set at a tidal volume (Vt) of 350 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 50%.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 5.9-6.5 x 10^9/L, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hct) level of 22.1-22.3%, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count (Plt) of"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   CT - no significant change (head)
   In the afternoon, temp up to 100.6.
   Hypotensive to 70s in the afternoon, put back on levophed and give 2x
   250cc bolus (SBP response = up to 90s).
   As a result, pulm deferred BAL/bronchoscopy to when patient
   hemodynamically stable and off of levophed - they are unclear what the
   diagnosis is, and have a very broad differential.

   24 Hour Events:
   CT - no significant change (head)
   In the afternoon, temp up to 100.6.
   Hypotensive to 70s in the afternoon, put back on levophed and give 2x
   250cc bolus (SBP response = up to 90s).
   As a result, pulm deferred BAL/bronchoscopy to when patient
   hemodynamically stable and off of levophed - they are unclear what the

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and two drug-eluting stents (DES) in place. She also has severe peripheral vascular disease and known systolic heart failure. The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure. She was transferred from another hospital with positive sputum cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and recent klebsiella in the sputum. The patient's mental status changed this morning. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to pneumonia or infected effusion, as indicated by positive sputum cultures for MRSA and klebsiella, as well as an infectious vs. inflammatory finding on the CT scan. She requires mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem for the suspected MRSA and klebsiella infections.
2. Fevers: The patient has fevers, which are most likely due to pneumonia, considering the negative results for liver function tests (LFTs), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) without significant growth, and negative mini-balloon (mini-BAL) cultures. There is a concern for vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VANCOMYCIN-RESISTANT S.AUREUS) pneumonia, so re"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent a trans thoracic echo which revealed air in the pericardium and mediastinum, indicative of barotrauma.
- A CT chest confirmed the presence of interstitial pulmonary emphysema, air in the mediastinum, and a small amount of air in the pericardium.
- The patient has been started on Bactrim and Prednisone for presumed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) treatment, although the sputum gram stain did not show any microorganisms.
- The patient's MAP (mean arterial pressure) is high, around 40s, and SBP (systolic blood pressure) is in the 70s. Neurosurgery instructed the nurse to keep SBP above 90, and the patient was temporarily given Norepinephrine at 5mg/hr before being taken off due to high blood pressure.
- The patient experienced respiratory distress while being turned, became hypertensive and tachycardic, and required an increase in FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) to 100%. The patient was transferred to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) today if a bed is available.
- The patient has allergies to Cardizem (oral) and Lipitor (oral), with unknown and muscle aches as respective reactions.
- The patient has received various"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Having tremendous difficulty
   weaning patient off of the ventilator due to desat
s and/or hypotensive
   episodes when try to alter physiology.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.   CT read indicates
   infectious vs. inflammatory. Concern for pneumopericardium (potentially
   from tracheostomy site, prior CABG, mediastinitis). Patient academic
   with increased CO2 retained on ABG this morning, unclear reason why
   (perhaps infection, over-diuresis, hypotension):
   - Continue AC ventilation with pressure support, monitor newly
   increased RR and TV
   - Goal I&O: even today; lasix 60mg [**Hospital1 **] and then additional prn to
   achieve goal
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Cont Vanc (started [**8-21**]) for hx of MRSA and recent klebsiella in
   sputum
   - per pharmacy, changed vanc dose from 750mg q12h to 1250mg daily
   - check vanco trough [**9-4**] (Thursday) morning before [**9-4**]
s AM dose
   - discontinue Meropenem following today
s doses (started [**8-23**]) as today
   is day #[**9-6**]
   - arrange multi-disciplinary meeting with pulm and ID today regarding
   lung disease and inability to wean off of the vent
   - f/u bronch/BAL today
   - echo today, focused on pedicardial region
   - CT chest today
   - f/u ABG this AM
   - d/c diamox now that significant diuresis completed and now that
   patient academic this morning
   .
   # Fevers
 considering pneumonia as most likely source thus far (no
   significant change to LFT
s over past week, CSF without significant
   growth, negative mini-BAL, no obvious skin wounds, c.diff negative)
   - Concern for vanco-resistant s.aureus pneumonia; re-consult ID re:
   addition of linezolid to antibiotic regimen
   - F/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Mental status
 Stable over past 24 hours grossly, following acute
   change yesterday morning with decreased response to pain and not moving
   extremities. Likely contributors include: ventriculomegaly,
   hydrocephalus, delirium secondary to PNA and hypoxemia, subarachnoid
   hemorrhage.
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CE
s as necessary if clinically indicated
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Continue ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded. Balancing between diuresis, hypotension, and overdiuresis.
   - Goal even I

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [2149] and has two drug-eluting stents (DES) in place. She also has severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and known systolic heart failure (HF). The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and respiratory failure. She has been transferred from an outside hospital with acute respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to desaturation and hypotensive episodes. She has positive sputum cultures for MRSA and klebsiella, indicating a possible pneumonia or infected effusion. There is also concern for pneumopericardium, which could be related to the tracheostomy site, prior CABG, or mediastinitis.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated with antibiotics for MRSA and recent klebsiella in sputum. However, there is still a concern for vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) pneumonia, and ID consultation is recommended to add linezolid to the antibiotic regimen.

3. Mental Status Changes: The patient has had acute changes in mental status, including decreased response to pain, not moving extremities, ventriculomegaly, hydro"

   episodes when try to alter physiology.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.   CT read indicates
   infectious vs. inflammatory. Concern for pneumopericardium and
   pneumomediastinum based on recent CT (potentially from tracheostomy
   site, prior CABG, mediastinitis).  Patient academic on vent last night,
   switched to CMV again this AM.  Plan to transfer to MICU today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in [**2149**]. She has multiple comorbidities including severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), known systolic heart failure (HF), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory failure, leading to transfer from the outside hospital (OSH).

The patient is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and has been experiencing difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to desaturation and hypotension episodes. The recent CT scan indicates the presence of interstitial pulmonary emphysema, air in the mediastinum, and a small amount of air in the pericardium, consistent with barotrauma.

The patient's current medications include carvedilol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and nitroglycerin sublingually as needed for chest pain. She is also on prophylactic antibiotics and steroids for suspected Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.8 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 7.9 g/dL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 26 mg/dL, and abnormal arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicating respiratory acidosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate (HR) of 68 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 83/32 to 162/54 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%, and temperature within normal limits.

Given the patient's history of multiple comorbidities and acute respiratory failure, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These may include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is a common complication in critically ill patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae has been identified on the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture. The presence of fever, increased white blood cell count, and infiltrates on the chest X-ray further support the possibility of pneumonia.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. The healthcare team is taking measures to prevent this by elevating the head of bed (HOB) and ensuring proper hygiene practices.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD and systolic HF. The echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, indicating some degree of heart dysfunction. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status is necessary to detect any exacerbations of her pre-existing heart conditions.

4. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, which may be attributed to various factors such as hypoxemia, sepsis, or medication effects. It"

   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG [**2149**], 2 DES in place, AAA,
   severe PVD, known systolic HF who presents with chest pain, shortness
   of breath, transferred from OSH with acute respiratory failure,
   concerning PNA vs volume overload.  Having tremendous difficulty
   weaning patient off of the ventilator due to desat
s and/or hypotensive
   episodes when try to alter physiology.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure: Pt with + sputum cxs for MRSA at outside
   hospital, now with klebsiella on recent BAL.  Now that we have
   diuresed, less cardiogenic concern for respiratory distress, most
   concerning for pneumonia or infected effusion.   CT read indicates
   infectious vs. inflammatory. Concern for pneumopericardium and
   pneumomediastinum based on recent CT (potentially from tracheostomy
   site, prior CABG, mediastinitis).  Patient academic on vent last night,
   switched to CMV again this AM.  Plan to transfer to MICU today.
   Bactrim/steroids started yesterday per pulm recs.
   - Continue CMV
   - Goal I&O: even today; will bolus lasix as needed
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN shortness of breath
   - Continue bactrim and steroids for PCP empiric tx
   - completed course of Vanco and Meropenem
   .
   # Fevers
 no fevers o/n.  Some concern for vanc-resistant pneumonia.
   Blood/urine/CSF cxs negative to date.
   - F/u blood cxs
   - CIS
   - Pulm considering BAL, however held off for now given
   pneumomediastinum/pneumopericardium
   .
   # Mental status
 Stably poor over past 24 hours grossly, does not
   follow commands.  Opens eyes to sternal rub only. Likely contributors
   include: ventriculomegaly, hydrocephalus, delirium secondary to PNA and
   hypoxemia, hx subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
s, aim to maintain SBP >70
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p CABG in [**2149**] s/p DES in [**2159**].
   Anatomy is LIMA to diag, SVG-diag, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM. Currently low
   suspicion for cardiac etiology of her respiratory distress.  She does
   have chronic ST depressions which do not appear to be significantly
   worse during this admission.
   - CE
s as necessary if clinically indicated
   - Continue cardiac meds including carvedilol 25mg po bid, 325mg mg po
   daily, Lisinopril 10mg po daily, Atorvastatin 80mg, SL nitro PRN CP.
   - Continue ASA
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement
   .
   # PUMP:  Systolic congestive heart failure. EF 1 month prior was 20%.
   Echo at OSH shows EF 35%, 2+ MR.  Pt still appears to be volume
   overloaded. Balancing between diuresis, hypotension, and overdiuresis.
   - Goal even I
s & O
s today; Lasix 60mg [**Hospital1 **] and prn if needed to
   achieve this goal
   - Continue Lisinopril, Carvedilol, hold for hypotension
   .
   # RHYTHM: Currently NSR.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop on [**8-27**].
   Iron 49, Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176
 anemia of chronic disease picture
   with extremely high ferritin.  Will not transfuse today given that she
   does not appear to have active ischemia; Hct stable in 22 range.
   - maintain active T&S
   - follow daily Hct
   .
   # Scalp hematoma: Re-dressed by neurosurgery, no evidence of active
   bleed or infection.  If infected, pt covered by vanc, however wound
   culture showed sparse and rare growth coag negative Staph.
   -Continue wound care
   -Continue Vancomycin.
   .
   #  Multiple fractures seen on x-ray:
   - Fentanyl drip covering
   .
   #  Depression: Continue prozac
   .
   #  Seizure prophylaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs. EEG
   not required now as other etiologies more likely for AMS and on
   therapeutic Keppra.  Neuro signed off.

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, admitted to the ICU for acute decompensation. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, hypertension, tachycardia, and increased FiO2 requirements. Bronchoscopic evaluation revealed air in the pericardium and mediastinum, consistent with barotrauma. There is also evidence of interstitial pulmonary emphysema on CT chest. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia. The patient has been receiving empiric treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) with Bactrim and Prednisone, as well as antifungal therapy for suspected yeast infection. His blood cultures are negative for microorganisms, but the patient remains hypertensive and tachycardic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing VAP.
2. Barotrauma: The presence of air in the pericardium and mediastinum suggests the possibility of barotrauma, which can lead to cardiac tamponade or pneumothorax.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers may indicate an ongoing infection, potentially leading to sepsis.
4. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's chronic"

   Assessment and Plan
   70-year-old woman with severe respiratory failure following a recent
   admission for polytrauma resulting in trach/vent.  However, her CT near
   discharge was markedly better than present.  Admitted and has had AMI
   as well as hydrocephalus.  She has been diuresed successfully.
   Respiratory failure
   The underlying etiology is far from clear.  The most likely is probably
   ARDS that may be entering the fibroproliferative phase.  Bacterial
   infection seems unlikely as a cause for her current diffuse CT changes,
   though may co-exist and has certainly grown things from respiratory
   samples.  Primary pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. DAH, COP,
   eosinophilic disease) is possible though unlikely.  Unusual infections
   (PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 10576**], etc.) are in differential though again seem less likely.
   Although she is higher than average risk, I think that the benefits of
   bronchoscopy outweigh the risks at present.  We will plan for bronch
   with BAL (with deep sedation and single dose of paralytics) tomorrow
   morning.  This will provide cell count and good microbiologic samples.
   If nondiagnostic, will need to consider balance of risks/benefits from
   empiric treatment vs. formal biopsy.
   Hypercarbia/respiratory acidosis
   He approximately 10-point rise is pCO2 today is worrisome.  However, I
   suspect it represents relative hypovolemia (occurred after Lasix,
   associated with rise in HR, CVP ~3 pre-Lasix, and pulse pressure
   variation currently quite marked).  Will try fluid challenge (to adjust
   relative [**Name (NI) **] zones); if no response then consider PCV.
   Pneumomediastinum
   No evidence of tension or infection at present.  Echo reassuring
   regarding pericardium.
   Minimize vent pressures as feasible, and follow clinically for now.
   Elevated Intracranial Pressure
   Felt most likely related to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following
   intracranial bleeding.
   Appreciate neurosurgery
s help
   Anticipate change of drain on Friday
   Goal ICP <10, and maintenance of CPP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with severe respiratory failure following a recent admission for polytrauma. She has been admitted multiple times and has experienced acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and hydrocephalus. The patient's condition has worsened, with her CT scan showing marked deterioration compared to a previous near-discharge CT scan. She has been successfully diuresed, but her current diffuse CT changes suggest a possible underlying etiology such as ARDS or bacterial infection. The patient's respiratory failure is still unclear, and there is a possibility of primary pulmonary parenchymal disease or unusual infections. A bronchoscopy with BAL will be planned to obtain cell count and microbiologic samples. The patient also has hypercarbia/respiratory acidosis, pneumomediastinum, and elevated intracranial pressure related to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and she remains in the ICU."

   #  Respiratory failure:
   Differential:  fibroproliferative ARDS, atypical infectious processes,
   including viral pneumonias (CMV possible, VZV, RXV, Flu unlikely),
   legionella negative, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 10587**] alveolar hemorrhage, neoplastic
   process
   Regarding ventilation, she is now on pressure control ventilation with
   an increase in FiO2.
   - bronchoscopy this morning
   - f/u cultures
   - trend lung compliance
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - f/u fungal markers (glucan)
   Plan also for bronchoscopy quickly in the morning with paralysis for
   BAL.
   # Pneumomediastinum:
   - Following CXRs, hemodynamics
   # Acute Anemia
   - HCT drop from 24.7 to 19 with ~1.5L of IVF, no clear source of
   bleeding seen (no GIB). Respiratory secretions are more blood tinged,
   though unlikely to account for one unit.
   - add hemolysis studies
   - bronchoscopy/BAL for blood, hemosiderin laden macrophages
   - transfuse <21
   - consider abdominal CT scan
   # Fevers
   - f/u cultures, obtain BAL planned for the morning.
   # Elevated Intracranial Pressure: Likely resultant from malabsorptive
   hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. Appreciate neurosurgical
   consultation service following
   - Continue extraventricular drain, plan to replace on Friday at 12:30.
   - aspirin on hold pending drain change
   - follow ICP, goal <10.
   # Mental status
 Remains poor, not withdrawing to pain but on
   sedation. Will do daily sedation holiday
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
s, aim to maintain SBP >70 to ensure adequate
   cerebral perfusion
   # Seizure Prophlyaxis: on keppra.
   # Congestive Heart Failure:
   - Can continue maintenance furosemide, but goal is to keep even given
   recent hypotension
   - continue afterload reduction with Lisinopril 10mg po daily
   - continue carvedilol.
   - EF continues to improve.
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  Significant cardiac disease though she has
   currently ruled out for MI.
   - holding asa for anticipation of EVD (drain) revision
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement though will have to discuss since drain is being changed.
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop on [**8-27**].

 anemia of chronic disease picture
   with extremely high ferritin.
   - Transfuse <21
   - maintain active T&S
   - follow daily Hct
   # Scalp hematoma: No evidence of active bleed or infection.
   -Continue wound care
   #  Fractures
   - on fent gtt/versed for pain management.
   #  Depression: Continue prozac
   #  Seizure prophylaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs. EEG

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and persistent ground glass opacities concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing respiratory failure, pneumomediastinum, acute anemia, fevers, elevated intracranial pressure, mental status changes, seizure prophylaxis, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, normocytic anemia, scalp hematoma, fractures, depression, and seizure prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent ground glass opacities and ARDS increase the risk of respiratory failure. The current ventilation mode and FiO2 adjustments aim to optimize oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has evidence of pneumomediastinum on imaging, which can be a serious complication requiring further evaluation and management.
3. Acute Anemia: The sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration indicates acute anemia, which may be due to bleeding or hemolysis. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Fevers: The patient's persistent fevers suggest an ongoing infectious process or inflammatory response. Cultures and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are planned for identification and management of the causative agent.
5. Elevated Intracranial Pressure: The patient has elevated intracranial pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and was placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by fibroproliferative ARDS, atypical infectious processes, including viral pneumonias (CMV possible, VZV, RXV, Flu unlikely), and pneumomediastinum. She also has acute anemia with a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 24.7 to 19.4, fevers, elevated intracranial pressure (likely resultant from malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding), mental status changes, seizures, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, normocytic anemia, scalp hematoma, fractures, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function remains poor, and there is concern for fibroproliferative ARDS. Ventilation strategies will be continued, and weaning FiO2 will be done over the course of the day.

2. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has developed pneumomediastinum, which requires pressure control ventilation and monitoring of hemodynamics. A repeat chest X-ray is planned after bronchoscopy for possible pneumothorax.

3. Acute Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped significantly, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and persistent ground glass opacities concerning for fibroproliferative acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is currently on pressure control ventilation with an increase in FiO2 due to pneumomediastinum. The patient also has acute anemia, fevers, elevated intracranial pressure, mental status changes, seizure prophylaxis, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, normocytic anemia, scalp hematoma, fractures, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The presence of pneumomediastinum increases the risk of complications such as tension pneumothorax or pneumopericardium.
3. Acute Anemia: The sudden drop in hemoglobin levels can lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues, potentially resulting in organ dysfunction.
4. Fevers: The ongoing fevers may indicate an ongoing infection, which could be due to various causes, including atypical infectious processes or nosocomial pneumonia.
5. Elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The elevated ICP poses a risk of brain herniation and cerebral ischemia.
6. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status remains poor, indicating potential cerebral dysfunction and the need for"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease.
- She is currently experiencing respiratory failure likely due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient has ground glass opacities on imaging, which are concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS and less likely to be diffuse infection.
- She also has evidence of pneumomediastinum, which is being managed with pressure control ventilation.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 24.7 to 19, indicating acute anemia.
- There is no clear source of bleeding, but respiratory secretions are more blood-tinged.
- Blood tinged sputum could indicate the presence of blood in the respiratory system.
- The patient has fevers, which were previously treated with antibiotics but have now stopped.
- Her intracranial pressure is elevated and likely due to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding.
- Neurosurgical consultation has been obtained, and an extraventricular drain has been placed.
- The patient's mental status remains poor, and she is on sedation. Daily sedation holiday is planned.
- She is on seizure prophylaxis with Kendra, and EEG is not required at this time.
- The patient has congestive heart failure, and diuresis is being considered.
- She has a history"

   Assessment and Plan:
   70 yo F with a history of CAD with persistent ground glass opacities
   concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS, less likely diffuse infection.
   #  Respiratory failure: Likely ARDS.
   - continue current vent settings on pressure control ventilation (low
   tidal volumes)
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u cultures
   - trend lung compliance
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - f/u fungal markers (glucan)
   # Pneumomediastinum:
   - Following CXRs, hemodynamics
   - Pressure control ventilation
   # Acute Anemia: HCT drop from 24.7 to 19 with ~1.5L of IVF, no clear
   source of bleeding seen (no GIB). Respiratory secretions are more blood
   tinged, though unlikely to account for one unit.
   - check Hct after OR experience
   - bronchoscopy/BAL for blood, hemosiderin laden macrophages
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   - consider abdominal CT scan if HD unstable
   # Fevers: stopped vanc/meropenem [**9-3**] after 2 week course.
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BAL
   # Elevated Intracranial Pressure: Likely resultant from malabsorptive
   hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. Appreciate neurosurgical
   consultation service following
   - Continue extraventricular drain, plan to replace on Friday at 12:30.
   - aspirin on hold pending drain change, holding HSQ
 will restart
   after OR
   - follow ICP, goal <10.
   # Mental status
 Remains poor, not withdrawing to pain but on
   sedation. Will do daily sedation holiday
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
s, aim to maintain SBP >70 to ensure adequate
   cerebral perfusion
   - neuro recs
   - daily wake up
   # Seizure Prophlyaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs. EEG
   not required now as other etiologies more likely for AMS and on
   therapeutic Keppra.
   # Congestive Heart Failure:
   - Can continue maintenance furosemide, but goal is to keep even given
   recent hypotension
   - consider diuresis
   - hold captopril / lisinopril
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  Significant cardiac disease though she has
   currently ruled out for MI.
   - holding asa for anticipation of EVD (drain) revision
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement though will have to discuss since drain is being changed.
   #  Normocytic anemia: HCT stable. Baseline from [**Month (only) 435**] hospitalization
   here was in 20s, however pt with 4 point crit drop on [**8-27**].
   Iron 49, Ferritin 1828, TIBC 176 - anemia of chronic disease picture
   with extremely high ferritin.
   - Transfuse <21
   - maintain active T&S
   - follow daily Hct
   # Scalp hematoma: No evidence of active bleed or infection.

   Assessment and Plan:
   70 yo F with a history of CAD with persistent ground glass opacities
   concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS, less likely diffuse infection.
   #  Respiratory failure: Likely ARDS in fibroproliferative phase.
   - continue current vent settings on pressure control ventilation (low
   tidal volumes)
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u cultures
   - trend lung compliance
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - f/u fungal markers (glucan)
   # Pneumomediastinum:
   - Following CXRs, hemodynamics
   - Pressure control ventilation
   # Acute Anemia: HCT drop from 24.7 to 19 with ~1.5L of IVF, no clear
   source of bleeding seen (no GIB). Pt has responded to transfusion of
   one unit with otherwise stable hematocrits.
   - check Hct after OR experience
   - no hemosiderin laden macrophages seeen
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   - consider abdominal CT scan if HD unstable
   # Fevers: stopped vanc/meropenem [**9-3**] after 2 week course.
   - Check CSF cell count and culutre
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BAL
   # Elevated Intracranial Pressure: Likely resultant from malabsorptive
   hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. Appreciate neurosurgical
   consultation service following
   - Continue extraventricular drain, plan to replace on Friday at 12:30.
   - aspirin on hold pending drain change, holding HSQ
 will restart
   after OR
   - follow ICP, goal <10.
   # Mental status
 Remains poor, not withdrawing to pain but on
   sedation. Will do daily sedation holiday
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
s, aim to maintain SBP >70 to ensure adequate
   cerebral perfusion
   - neuro recs
   - daily wake up
   # Seizure Prophlyaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs. EEG
   not required now as other etiologies more likely for AMS and on
   therapeutic Keppra.
   # Congestive Heart Failure:
   - Can continue maintenance furosemide, but goal is to keep even given
   recent hypotension
   - consider diuresis
   - hold captopril / lisinopril
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  Significant cardiac disease though she has
   currently ruled out for MI.
   - holding asa pending neurosurg restart.
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement though will have to discuss since drain is being changed.
   # Scalp hematoma: No evidence of active bleed or infection.
   -Continue wound care
   #  Fractures
   - on fent gtt/versed for pain management.
   #  Depression: Continue prozac

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and persistent ground glass opacities, concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely ARDS in the fibroproliferative phase, pneumomediastinum, acute anemia, fevers, elevated intracranial pressure, poor mental status, seizure prophylaxis, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, scalp hematoma, fractures, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing ARDS in the fibroproliferative phase, which can lead to severe respiratory distress and difficulty in oxygenation.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The presence of pneumomediastinum indicates air leakage into the mediastinum, which can be a life-threatening condition if it causes respiratory compromise or other complications.
3. Acute Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped significantly, indicating acute anemia. This can lead to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and organ dysfunction.
4. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. It is important to identify the source of infection and provide appropriate treatment.
5. Elevated Intracranial Pressure: The patient has elevated intracranial pressure, which can result in neurological deterioration and potential brain herniation if not"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. She has persistent ground glass opacities concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS and is likely to have MRSA and Klebsiella infection in her bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains sedated and has poor mental status. She also has elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) due to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding, and a neurosurgical consultation has been obtained. Other issues include congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, scalp hematoma, fractures, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure. Continued pressure control ventilation with low tidal volumes and monitoring of ABGs are recommended.
2. MRSA and Klebsiella Infection: The presence of MRSA and Klebsiella in the BAL indicates a bacterial infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and cultures should be followed up.
3. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has developed pneumomediastinum, which can lead to further complications such as subcutaneous emphysema or mediastinitis. Close monitoring of CXRs and hemodynamics is advised.
4. Acute Anemia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient underwent a ventricular drain change to the left side, with the tip of the catheter sent for culture. During the procedure, the patient's vent settings were increased to TV 600 and RR, and a chest X-ray was ordered to assess for barotrauma. Vanc/[Last Name] was restarted for positive BAL with MRSA/Klebsiella. Lasix 20mg IV was given, and the patient's gases are improving. 

24-hour events include an ICP catheter being stopped and started, and the patient being taken to the OR. Allergies are documented, including Cardizem (oral), Lipitor (muscle aches), and unknown allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on 09/05/2160 at 04:45 PM and Meropenem on 09/06/2160 at 12:06 AM. 

Infusions include Fentanyl at 100 mcg/hour and Midazolam (Versed) at 2 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include Famotidine (Pepcid), Midazolam (Versed), Fentanyl, and Furosemide (Lasix). 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results. 

Physical examination findings are not assessed due to various reasons. Labs show elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   She is mildly hyperkalemic this morning; would check EKG to ensure no
   peaked T
s and recheck
lytes this afternoon.
 INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Vanco
   Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] had been on for 14 days; stopped on [**9-3**] on transfer from
   the CCU. Resatarted for positive MRSA and klebs in bronch sample. CMV
   viral load, BAL, galactomannan and beta-glucan pending.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Cannot assess her mental status meaningfully while she is on sedation.
   Will decrease sedation when we are able from a respiratory perspective.
   Currently she remains too tenuous to down-titrate. Keppra for seizure
   prophylaxis.  Neuro following for ventricular drain. Going to send CSF
   culture again today [**9-6**]
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Goal CVP ~8. She appears to still be volume overloaded based on CXR,
   but CVP lower today (6).  She has been on and off Neo ; she may require
   intermittent pressors for low BP in order to minimize need for fluids,
   since fluids tend to make her resp status decline rapidly.  Trying to
   hold volume status steady where it is [**9-6**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure following a motor vehicle accident. She has multiple fractures and suffered from subdural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient also has MRSA and klebsiella infections in her sputum and is on ventilatory support. She has been readmitted from the operating room with hydrocephalus requiring a ventricular drain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent MRSA and klebsiella infections, which can lead to worsening sepsis and respiratory failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) puts her at risk for ongoing respiratory failure, requiring careful management of oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Cardiac Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic heart failure, which may lead to fluid overload and worsening cardiac function. Close monitoring of her fluid balance and cardiovascular status is essential.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient has had a ventricular drain placed due to hydrocephalus. There is a risk of complications such as infection, intracranial hemorrhage, or worsening neurological status.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels may require transfusion, and ongoing monitoring of her blood counts is necessary.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient is mildly hyperkalemic, and close monitoring of electrolyte levels is required to prevent any"

   Assessment and Plan
   ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   She is mildly hyperkalemic this morning; would check EKG to ensure no
   peaked T
s and recheck
lytes this afternoon. Bicarb decreased to 30
   with resolution of her respiratory acidosis (with PaCO2s in the 80-90s
   yesterday.)
 INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Vanco
   Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] had been on for 14 days; stopped on [**9-3**] on transfer from
   the CCU. No e/o further infectious complications.  CMV viral load, BAL
   cultures, galactomannan and beta-glucan pending.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Cannot assess her mental status meaningfully while she is on sedation.
   Will decrease sedation when we are able from a respiratory perspective.
   Currently she remains too tenuous to down-titrate. Keppra for seizure
   prophylaxis.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Goal CVP ~8. She appears to be more volume overloaded today in as that
   her compliance is even lower (down to 7) and her CVP is up to 14-18 (it
   had been [**1-31**] on transfer from the CCU.) She has been on and off Neo
   over the past 24 hours; she may require intermittent pressors while
   attempting to diurese her from her current CVP in an effort to improve
   (as minimal as it may be) her compliance.
 ANEMIA
   Follow H/H. Transfuse for Hgb < 7. No e/o acute bleeding.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   She has ARDS based on her PaO2/FiO2 ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and
   no compelling e/o pulmonary edema contributing to her overall
   presentation. She remains very tenuous with a compliance of 7 leading
   to tidal volumes of ~250cc despite a set inspiratory pressure of >30cm
   H2O. She has essentially no reserve in terms of safely increasing her
   inspiratory pressure as she is already above 30cm H2O. Further
   increases will increase her risk of further barotrauma in addition to
   her pneumomediastinum. A pneumothorax would be devastating for her.
   Hopefully, with diuresis her compliance will improve somewhat.
   Otherwise, we will continue supportive care, attempt to minimize
   complications (although her compliance necessitates high airway
   pressures, increasing her risk for barotrauma.)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing multiple fractures and subdural hematoma/ subarachnoid hemorrhage (SDH/SAH) from a motor vehicle accident (MVA). She also has a tracheostomy and is readmitted from the operating room (OSH) with respiratory failure, MRSA, and ESBL klebsiella in her sputum. The patient has persistent diffuse ground glass opacities and poor lung compliance, making it difficult to ventilate. There has been only mild improvement with diuretics, and the patient has a low ejection fraction (EF). Bronchoscopy shows persistent MRSA and klebsiella, although at low colony counts. The patient's course has been complicated by hydrocephalus, which required a ventricular drain.

The patient has allergies to Cardizem (Oral) and Lipitor (Oral), with muscle aches as a side effect. She received vancomycin on [2160-9-5] at 04:45 PM and meropenem on [2160-9-6] at 05:53 AM. She is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam (Versed). Other ICU medications include famotidine (Pepcid), midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and furosemide (Lasix).

   Assessment and Plan
   ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   She is mildly hyperkalemic this morning; would check EKG to ensure no
   peaked T
s and recheck
lytes this afternoon.
 INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Vanco
   Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] had been on for 14 days; stopped on [**9-3**] on transfer from
   the CCU. Resatarted for positive MRSA and klebs in bronch sample. CMV
   viral load, BAL, galactomannan and beta-glucan pending.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Cannot assess her mental status meaningfully while she is on sedation.
   Will decrease sedation when we are able from a respiratory perspective.
   Currently she remains too tenuous to down-titrate. Keppra for seizure
   prophylaxis.  Neuro following for ventricular drain. Going to send CSF
   culture again today [**9-6**]
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Goal CVP ~8. She appears to still be volume overloaded based on CXR,
   but CVP lower today (6).  She has been on and off Neo ; she may require
   intermittent pressors for low BP in order to minimize need for fluids,
   since fluids tend to make her resp status decline rapidly.  Trying to
   hold volume status steady where it is [**9-6**].
 ANEMIA
   Follow H/H. Transfuse for Hgb < 7. No e/o acute bleeding.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   She has ARDS based on her PaO2/FiO2 ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and
   no compelling e/o pulmonary edema contributing to her overall
   presentation. Stable on slightly decreased inspiratory pressure. TV
   280-30o.  Will try to wean FiO2 gradually as able.

   Assessment and Plan
   ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
   She is mildly hyperkalemic this morning; would check EKG to ensure no
   peaked T
s and recheck
lytes this afternoon. Bicarb decreased to 30
   with resolution of her respiratory acidosis (with PaCO2s in the 80-90s
   yesterday.)
 INFECTIOUS DISEASE
   Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] had been on for 14 days; stopped on [**9-3**] on transfer from
   the CCU. No e/o further infectious complications.  CMV viral load, BAL
   cultures, galactomannan and beta-glucan pending.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Cannot assess her mental status meaningfully while she is on sedation.
   Will decrease sedation when we are able from a respiratory perspective.
   Currently she remains too tenuous to down-titrate. Keppra for seizure
   prophylaxis.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Goal CVP ~8. She appears to be more volume overloaded today in as that
   her compliance is even lower (down to 7) and her CVP is up to 14-18 (it
   had been [**1-31**] on transfer from the CCU.) She has been on and off Neo
   over the past 24 hours; she may require intermittent pressors while
   attempting to diurese her from her current CVP in an effort to improve
   (as minimal as it may be) her compliance.
 ANEMIA
   Follow H/H. Transfuse for Hgb < 7. No e/o acute bleeding.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   She has ARDS based on her PaO2/FiO2 ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and
   no compelling e/o pulmonary edema contributing to her overall
   presentation. She remains very tenuous with a compliance of 7 leading
   to tidal volumes of ~250cc despite a set inspiratory pressure of >30cm
   H2O. She has essentially no reserve in terms of safely increasing her
   inspiratory pressure as she is already above 30cm H2O. Further
   increases will increase her risk of further barotrauma in addition to
   her pneumomediastinum. A pneumothorax would be devastating for her.
   Hopefully, with diuresis her compliance will improve somewhat.
   Otherwise, we will continue supportive care, attempt to minimize
   complications (although her compliance necessitates high airway
   pressures, increasing her risk for barotrauma.)

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) with multiple fractures and subdural hematoma/SAH. She has a history of readmission from the operating room (OSH) with respiratory failure, MRSA, and ESBL klebsiella in her sputum. The patient's course has been complicated by hydrocephalus requiring ventricular drain. She is currently on ventilatory support with a tracheostomy tube, receiving medications such as fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, and lasix. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 167/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 6.6-7.6 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 24.3-26.7%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 318-348 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 0.6-0.5 mg/dL, and elevated lactic acid levels. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with a PaCO2 of 80-90 mmHg. The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and persistent ground glass opacities concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS, less likely diffuse infection. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely in the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS. There is also evidence of MRSA and Klebsiella found on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The patient remains on pressure control ventilation with improved ABG.

2. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has developed pneumomediastinum, which is the presence of air in the mediastinum. This condition requires close monitoring of hemodynamics and continued pressure control ventilation.

3. Acute anemia: The patient has a trend of decreased hematocrit (HCT) due to likely decreased production, phlebotomy, and hemodilution. The HCT should be checked after surgical procedures, and transfusion should be considered for HCT <21. An abdominal CT scan may be considered if hemodynamic instability persists.

4. Fevers: The patient has been restarted on vancomycin and meropenem for an 8-day course. Cultures, including CSF, should be monitored, and the fever curve should be followed.

5. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient likely has elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   70 yo F with a history of CAD with persistent ground glass opacities
   concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS, less likely diffuse infection.
   #  Respiratory failure: Likely ARDS in fibroproliferative phase. Also
   with MRSA and Klebsiella found on [**9-4**] BAL
   - continue current vent settings on pressure control ventilation (low
   tidal volumes)
   -day 2 of Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - follow ABGs
   - f/u cultures
   - trend lung compliance
   - f/u CMV viral load
   - f/u fungal markers (glucan)
   # Pneumomediastinum:
   - Following CXRs, hemodynamics
   - Pressure control ventilation
   # Acute Anemia: HCT drop from 24.7 to 19 with ~1.5L of IVF, no clear
   source of bleeding seen (no GIB). Pt has responded to transfusion of
   one unit with otherwise stable hematocrits.
   - check Hct after OR experience
   - no hemosiderin laden macrophages seen
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   - consider abdominal CT scan if HD unstable
   # Fevers: restarted vanc/meropenem [**9-5**] for 8 day course
   - Check CSF cell count and culutre
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u BAL
   # Elevated Intracranial Pressure: Likely resultant from malabsorptive
   hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. Appreciate neurosurgical
   consultation service following. Drain changed in OR on [**9-5**]
   - Continue extraventricular drain, plan to replace on Friday at 12:30.
   - aspirin on hold pending drain change, holding HSQ
 will restart
   after OR
   - follow ICP, goal <10.
   # Mental status
 Remains poor, not withdrawing to pain but on
   sedation. Will do daily sedation holiday
   - f/u neurosurgery rec
s, aim to maintain SBP >70 to ensure adequate
   cerebral perfusion
   - neuro recs
   - daily wake up
   -f/u old ouwnd tip
   # Seizure Prophlyaxis:  On keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Neuro recs. EEG
   not required now as other etiologies more likely for AMS and on
   therapeutic Keppra.
   # Congestive Heart Failure:
   - Can continue maintenance furosemide, but goal is to keep even given
   recent hypotension
   - consider diuresis
   - hold captopril / lisinopril
   # Coronary Artery Disease:  Significant cardiac disease though she has
   currently ruled out for MI.
   - holding asa pending neurosurg restart.
   - Holding Plavix 75mg po daily for now given recent drain placement.;
   neurosurg ok to re-start Plavix [**9-6**] for her recent cardiac stent
   placement though will have to discuss since drain is being changed.
   # Scalp hematoma: No evidence of active bleed or infection.
   -Continue wound care
   #  Fractures
   - on fent gtt/versed for pain management.
   #  Depression: Continue prozac

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been intubated and placed on pressure control ventilation. The patient also has a pneumomediastinum, acute anemia, fevers, elevated intracranial pressure, poor mental status, seizure prophylaxis, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, scalp hematoma, fractures, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring of ABGs and lung compliance is recommended.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has evidence of pneumomediastinum, which can potentially worsen or lead to further complications such as subcutaneous emphysema or mediastinitis. Follow-up CXRs and hemodynamic monitoring are important.
3. Acute Anemia: The patient's HCT has dropped significantly, indicating acute anemia. Continued monitoring of hematocrits and transfusion as necessary is recommended.
4. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, and there are multiple pending cultures. Close monitoring of fever curve and follow-up cultures are important.
5. Elevated Intracranial Pressure: The patient's ICP is elevated, likely due to malabsorptive hydrocephalus"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and persistent ground glass opacities concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS. She is currently in the ICU on pressure control ventilation. The patient has MRSA and Klebsiella found on bronchoalveolar lavage. She has developed a cuff leak yesterday and transiently dropped her mental status, but remains on PCV with improved ABG. The patient is on day 3 of Vanc/[Last Name] x 8 days. She also has pneumomediastinum, acute anemia, fevers, elevated intracranial pressure, mental status changes, seizure prophylaxis, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, scalp hematoma, fractures, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent ground glass opacities and presence of MRSA and Klebsiella suggest a high risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The patient's chest X-rays should be monitored for any signs of worsening pneumomediastinum. Pressure control ventilation should be continued to prevent further damage to the lung tissue.
3. Acute anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, indicating acute anemia. Daily monitoring of hemoglobin levels is crucial to determine if transfusion is required.
4. Fevers: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has a history of motor vehicle accident trauma with multiple fractures and subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages. The patient underwent tracheostomy and was readmitted from the operating room with persistent diffuse ground glass opacities, poor lung compliance, and difficulty ventilating. There is improvement with diuresis, but the patient has a low ejection fraction. Bronchoscopy shows persistent MRSA and klebsiella, although at low colony counts. The patient's course has been complicated by hydrocephalus requiring ventricular drain.

The patient has several medical allergies, including Cardizem (Diltiazem Hcl) and Lipitor (Atorvastatin Calcium), which cause muscle aches. The last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on 09/06/2160 at 08:00 AM and Meropenem on 09/07/2160 at 06:30 AM.

The patient is currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. Other medications include famotidine, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and nutrition supplementation through Nutren Pulmonary.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/44"

She has persistent diffuse ground glass opacities, poor lung compliance, and difficult to ventilate. The patient also has a low ejection fraction (EF) and is on diuretics. Bronchoscopy shows persistent MRSA and klebsiella, although at low colony counts. The patient's course has been complicated by hydrocephalus requiring ventricular drain.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/44 mmHg to 188/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on sedation with midazolam and fentanyl, and is receiving various medications including famotidine, heparin sodium, and others.

The patient's flow sheet data shows fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, set respiratory rate of 32, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 39 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is tracheostomized and sedated, with regular respirations, no murmurs or gallops, and normal lung sounds bilaterally. The patient's laboratory values indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate, and other abnormalities.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management for infectious disease (MRSA and klebsiella), altered mental status, heart failure (acute on chronic), anemia, respiratory failure (ARDS), and ICU care. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is as per the physician's recommendation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further infections due to MRSA and klebsiella, cardiac complications due to acute on chronic heart failure, seizures due to the use of sedation medications, and potential bleeding or clotting disorders."

   Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] had been on for 14 days; stopped on [**9-3**] on transfer from
   the CCU. Resatarted for positive MRSA and klebs in bronch sample. CMV
   viral load, galactomannan and beta-glucan pending.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Keeping sedation as light as possible to be able to assess mental
   status.  Generally unresponsive, with occasional sspontaneous movement
   of left arm.  Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.  Neuro following for
   ventricular drain. Repeat CSF sample sent [**9-6**], normal cell counts and
   culture negative to date.
                      -will repeat EEG to r/o seizure
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Goal CVP ~8.  CVP overnight [**3-2**], and BP low, so received some
   additional fluids.  BP stable this AM.
   Will try very los dose captopril this morning to see if this will help
   for her cardiac disease/low EF(with conservative holding parameters).
 ANEMIA
   Follow H/H. Transfuse for Hgb < 7. No e/o acute bleeding.  Hct stable
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   She has ARDS based on her PaO2/FiO2 ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and
   no compelling e/o pulmonary edema contributing to her overall
   presentation. Driving pressure back up to 35 overnight due to worsening
   hypercarbia. TV 280-300.  Will try to wean FiO2 gradually as able.
   Pneumomediastinum clinically stable, no change on CXR.Compliance [**8-7**]

   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed her hospital course, and
   was present for the key portions of the services provided.  I have
   reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note and agree with her findings and plan of care.
   Mrs [**Known lastname 9447**] is known to me from the consult service and unfortunately
   despite best efforts (including BAL and neurosurg taking her to the OR
   again) she remains with severe resp failure (lung compliance <10) and
   obtundation, both of unclear cause.  EEG planned. Pt back on
   antibiotics for BAL cultures, but [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
t believe her lung process is
   bacterial infection. As her pneumomediastinum has resolved by CXR one
   can increase PEEP if necessary for oxygenation, though that doesn
   seem necessary at present.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and suspected ARDS.
- The patient has ground glass opacities on chest X-ray, concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS.
- She has been diagnosed with MRSA and Klebsiella in her bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
- The patient developed a cuff leak yesterday and temporarily improved her respiratory status.
- She is currently on ventilator support with PCV mode and has improved ABG results.
- The patient has a history of congestive heart failure, for which she will be started on low-dose captopril.
- She also has a history of depression and will continue taking Prozac.
- The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute anemia, elevated intracranial pressure (possibly due to hydrocephalus), mental status changes, seizures, and fractures.
- She is currently on various medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and cardiac medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and she is on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for worsening ARDS.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has evidence of pneumomediastinum on imaging. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and pressure control ventilation is necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, MRSA and ESBL klebsiella in her sputum, and multiple fractures and subdural hematoma/subarachnoid hemorrhage from a motor vehicle accident. The patient has been readmitted from the operating room with persistent diffuse ground glass opacities, poor lung compliance, and difficulty in ventilation. She has a history of low ejection fraction and has shown only mild improvement with diuresis. A bronchoscopy revealed persistent MRSA and klebsiella, although at low colony counts. The patient's course has been complicated by hydrocephalus, which required a ventricular drain.

24-Hour Events:
The patient received midazolam and fentanyl infusions, as well as famotidine, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/48-210/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's CVP is 4 mmHg, ICP is 3 mmHg, and her fluid balance shows an intake of 2,371 mL and output of 1,197 mL.

   Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] had been on for 14 days; stopped on [**9-3**] on transfer from
   the CCU. Restarted for positive MRSA and klebs in bronch sample. CMV
   viral load, galactomannan pending and beta-glucan negative.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Keeping sedation as light as possible to be able to assess mental
   status.  Generally unresponsive, with occasional spontaneous movement
   of left arm.  Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.  Neuro following for
   ventricular drain. Repeat CSF sample sent [**9-6**], normal cell counts and
   culture negative to date.
                      -will repeat EEG to r/o seizure
                      -will talk to neuro about whether there is any
   significance to the RBC
s seen in her ventricular drain sample
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Goal CVP ~8.  BP labile.  More hypertensive again this AM.
   Added low dose captopril yesterday to see if this will help for her
   cardiac disease/low EF(with conservative holding parameters).
 ANEMIA
   Follow H/H. Transfuse for Hgb < 7. No e/o acute bleeding.  Hct stable
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   She has ARDS based on her PaO2/FiO2 ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and
   no compelling e/o pulmonary edema contributing to her overall
   presentation. Driving pressure back up to 35 due to worsening
   hypercarbia. TV 280-300.  Will try to wean FiO2 gradually as able.
   Pneumomediastinum clinically stable, no change on CXR. Compliance
   approx. 10 this AM.

   Assessment and Plan
 INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Vanco
   Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] had been on for 14 days; stopped on [**9-3**] on transfer from
   the CCU. Restarted for positive MRSA and klebs in bronch sample. CMV
   viral load, galactomannan pending and beta-glucan negative.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Keeping sedation as light as possible to be able to assess mental
   status.  Generally unresponsive, with occasional spontaneous movement
   of left arm.  Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.  Neuro following for
   ventricular drain. Repeat CSF sample sent [**9-6**], normal cell counts and
   culture negative to date.
                      -will repeat EEG to r/o seizure
                      -will talk to neuro about whether there is any
   significance to the RBC
s seen in her ventricular drain sample
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   Goal CVP ~8.  BP labile.  More hypertensive again this AM.
   Added low dose captopril yesterday to see if this will help for her
   cardiac disease/low EF(with conservative holding parameters).
 ANEMIA
   Follow H/H. Transfuse for Hgb < 7. No e/o acute bleeding.  Hct stable
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   She has ARDS based on her PaO2/FiO2 ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and
   no compelling e/o pulmonary edema contributing to her overall
   presentation. Driving pressure back up to 35 due to worsening
   hypercarbia. TV 280-300.  Will try to wean FiO2 gradually as able.
   Pneumomediastinum clinically stable, no change on CXR. Compliance
   approx. 10 this AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old woman who was involved in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and suffered multiple fractures and subdural/emphysema hemorrhages. She was readmitted to the ICU from the operating room with respiratory failure, MRSA, and ESBL klebsiella in her sputum. The patient has diffuse ground glass opacities in her lungs, poor lung compliance, and is difficult to ventilate. Bronchoscopy shows persistent MRSA and klebsiella, although at low colony counts. Her course has been complicated by hydrocephalus requiring a ventricular drain.

Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Drain Adjustment: The patient's ventricular drain had to be adjusted yesterday as it was not draining properly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) based on her PaO2/FiO2 ratio, bilateral infiltrates, and no compelling evidence of pulmonary edema contributing to her overall presentation. She is on mechanical ventilation with a driving pressure of 35 and a tidal volume (TV) of 280-300. Efforts are being made to wean FiO2 gradually as able.
3. Infections: The patient has MRSA and klebsiella in her sputum. She was previously on vancomycin and meropenem but developed resistance. Antibiotics were stopped on 9/3 but restarted due to positive bronchoscopic culture results"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing multiple fractures and a subdural hematoma (SDH) following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). She also has a history of respiratory failure, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing klebsiella in her sputum. The patient has been difficult to ventilate and has shown only mild improvement with diuretics. She has a low ejection fraction (EF).

The patient's course has been complicated by hydrocephalus, which required a ventricular drain. She has been on vancomycin and meropenem antibiotics for suspected MRSA and klebsiella infection, but bronchoscopy results showed persistent MRSA and klebsiella at low colony counts.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 113/48 mmHg to 210/88 mmHg, heart rate between 72-94 bpm, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 280-300 mL, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.6 K/u"

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and persistent ground glass opacities concerning for fibroproliferative ARDS, less likely diffuse infection. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypertension, pneumomediastinum, acute anemia, fevers, elevated intracranial pressure, mental status changes, seizure prophylaxis, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and scalp hematoma.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, uncontrolled hypertension, pneumomediastinum progression, further decline in hemoglobin levels, persistent or recurrent fevers, increased intracranial pressure, deterioration in mental status, seizures, worsening congestive heart failure, cardiac events, and potential infection at the scalp hematoma site.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, hemodynamic stability, neurologic function, and laboratory values. Timely intervention and management are crucial to prevent further complications and improve the patient's outcome."

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent a tracheostomy following a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and developed respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the fibroproliferative phase and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has an elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) due to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding, for which an extraventricular drain has been placed. Additionally, the patient has a scalp hematoma, fractures, depression, coronary artery disease, and macrocytic anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Close monitoring of respiratory status and implementing appropriate measures to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and assessing respiratory system infection markers, is essential.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be continued to prevent DVT.

3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid secretion. Pro"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, currently admitted to the ICU. She is unresponsive and has been experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to ARDS in the fibroproliferative phase. The patient also has hypertension and has shown labile blood pressure readings. Additionally, she has been diagnosed with pneumomediastinum, acute anemia, fevers, elevated intracranial pressure, mental status changes, and congestive heart failure. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has ruled out myocardial infarction. She also has scalp hematoma, fractures, and depression. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the progression of ARDS. Monitoring ABG if vent settings are changed, continuing current vent settings, following up with cultures, and trending lung compliance will be important.

2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed to prevent further complications. Trending BPs, continuing captopril at the current dose, and increasing if needed will be important.

3. Pneumomediastinum: The patient's pneumomediastinum requires close monitoring following CXRs and hemodynamics. Pressure control ventilation may be necessary.

4. Acute Anemia: The patient's acute anemia may progress, leading to decreased oxygen carrying capacity. Trending HCT, transfusing for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure. She underwent a tracheostomy following a motor vehicle accident and is now showing signs of fibrosing ARDS. The patient also has MRSA and Klebsiella in her BAL culture, indicating a possible infection. Her vital signs are stable, but she has hypotension that may be attributed to sedation, neurogenic shock, or septic shock. The patient's elevated ICP is due to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding, and she has a scalp hematoma with no active bleed or infection. Her mental status is impaired, and she has a history of coronary artery disease, depression, fractures, and a previous myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern as she has ARDS, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential ventilator dependence.
2. Infection: The presence of MRSA and Klebsiella in the BAL culture suggests a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia. This increases the risk of systemic infection and sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can be attributed to various causes, including sedation, neurogenic shock, or septic shock. Monitoring and managing blood pressure is crucial to maintain adequate organ perfusion.

","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with respiratory failure following a motor vehicle accident. She has been in the ICU for several days and has multiple medical complications. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS, and her respiratory status is stable with slightly improved compliance. She has a tracheostomy tube in place, and her blood gases are within normal limits.

The patient also has hypotension, which is multifactorial and most likely due to sedation rather than neurogenic shock or septic shock. She is hemodynamically stable off pressors and will be cautious with fluid resuscitation due to previous difficulties with oxygenation/ventilation.

In addition, the patient has elevated intracranial pressure attributed to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. Her ICP is at goal <10, and she has had a drain change in the OR. An MRI was ordered but could not be tolerated due to low compliance and tidal volumes on the ventilator.

The patient also has macrocytic anemia, which is stable with a Hct of 24.6%. She will have daily Hct monitoring, and transfusion will be considered for Hct <21. Guaiac all stools will be done.

Furthermore, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease and will be restarted on aspirin. Plavix will be held per neurosurg.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was involved in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and subsequently developed respiratory failure. She has undergone a tracheostomy and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely suffering from ARDS in the fibroproliferative phase, as evidenced by low compliance with ventilation and elevated peak pressures. There is also evidence of MRSA and Klebsiella in her respiratory cultures.

2. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension that is multifactorial, with sedation being a major contributing factor. Other potential causes include neurogenic shock from a CNS process or septic shock from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient has elevated ICP attributed to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. An extraventricular drain has been placed, and the goal is to maintain ICP below 10.

4. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is impaired, with primal reflexes observed on examination. CSF cultures are negative, and further evaluation by neurosurgery is recommended.

5. Pneumomediastinum: This condition has resolved on chest X-ray.

   Imaging: CXR [**9-10**] - In comparison with the study of [**9-9**], there is
   little overall
   change. Again there is diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
   consistent
   with the fibrosing stage of ARDS. Bibasilar pleural effusions with
   atelectatic changes at the bases. The possibility of superimposed
   consolidation, especially at the left base, cannot be excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   70 yo F with a history of CAD, s/p tracheostomy following MVA with
   respiratory failure in the setting of bilateral opacities concerning
   for fibroproliferative ARDS, less likely diffuse infection.
   #  Respiratory failure: Stable, due to ARDS; compliance slightly
   improved with less elevated peak pressures; MRSA (9000 cfu/ml) and
   Klebsiella ([**2150**] cfu/ml) on [**9-4**] BAL, as well as sputum Cx [**9-1**]; fungal
   markers negative; lack of respiratory drive and poor compliance are
   barriers to weaning
   -cont vanc/[**Last Name (un) 614**] day 7 (last day [**2160-9-12**])
   -cont low Vt ventilation, will lower driving pressure to reduce peak
   pressures
   -wean sedation (10-20%/day) as Vt will tolerate, continue bolus
   sedation/anxiolytics (zyprexa) as gradual replacement for continuous
   infusion
   -cautious with high PEEP in the setting of pneumomediastinum
   #Hypotension
 multifactorial, most attributable to sedation, less
   likely neurogenic shock from CNS process or septic shock from VAP;
   currently hemodynamically stable off pressors
   -cautious fluid resuscitation given prior difficulty with
   oxygenation/ventilation in the setting of mild volume overload (CVP
   3-5)
   -titrate neo gtt to MAP>65 if BP drops
   -cont hold BB, ACEi
   .
   # Elevated Intracranial Pressure: ICP at goal <10; attributed to
   malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. Drain
   changed in OR on [**9-5**]
   -appreciate neurosurg involvement
   -plan for VP shunt when infectious issues resolved
   -MRI ordered but could not tolerate traveling to study due to low
   compliance & tidal volumes on vent
   -maintain ICP, goal <10
   -keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Difficult to assess given sedation, however, pt
   has reactive pupils and some primitive reflexes.
   - Continue to wean sedation
   - Neurosurg following
   - Will try for MRI again today if patient stable
   .
   # Macrocytic anemia: Hct stable
   - daily Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease:
   - restarted aspirin
   - holding plavix per neurosurg
   .
   # Scalp hematoma: No evidence of active bleed or infection.
   -Continue wound care

   #  Depression:
   - restarted on fluoxetine per family request

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) resulting in respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), specifically the fibrosing stage, as evidenced by diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications on imaging. 

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure due to ARDS, hypotension (multifactorial, likely due to sedation and not neurogenic shock or septic shock), elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) attributed to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding, and altered mental status due to sedation. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is currently on medication for it. They also have macrocytic anemia, a scalp hematoma from the MVA, and depression.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume ventilation to reduce peak pressures. Sedation is being weaned gradually as tolerated, and zyprexa (olanzapine) is used for agitation. The patient's ICP is being monitored and managed with appropriate interventions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further increase in ICP leading to neurological deterioration, and potential infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the duration of mechanical ventilation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who experienced respiratory failure after a motor vehicle accident. She underwent a tracheostomy and is currently in the ICU. The patient has bilateral opacities on imaging consistent with fibrosing ARDS, and there is a possibility of superimposed consolidation, especially at the left base.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure due to ARDS, hypotension that is multifactorial but mainly attributed to sedation, elevated intracranial pressure attributed to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding, altered mental status likely due to sedation, macrocytic anemia, coronary artery disease, and a scalp hematoma.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume ventilation to reduce peak pressures. Sedation is being weaned gradually as tolerated, and the patient will continue to receive bolus sedation/anxiolytics. Fluid resuscitation is cautious due to prior difficulty with oxygenation/ventilation in the setting of mild volume overload. Blood pressure management involves avoiding hypotension and maintaining a mean arterial pressure greater than 65.

The patient has an ICP catheter in place and is being monitored for elevated intracranial pressure. Neurosurgical consultation is planned, and a VP shunt may be considered once infectious issues are resolved. An MRI is ordered but the patient was unable to tolerate traveling to the study due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who has been admitted to the ICU following a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and subsequent respiratory failure. She has undergone a tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has a scalp hematoma, altered mental status, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), macrocytic anemia, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS is stable, but there are barriers to weaning from mechanical ventilation, including lack of respiratory drive, poor compliance, and agitation with decreased sedation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial and mainly attributed to sedation. Other causes such as neurogenic shock or septic shock should be considered and monitored.
3. Elevated Intracranial Pressure: The patient's ICP is at goal <10, attributed to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. Neurosurgical involvement is recommended for further management.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is difficult to assess due to sedation. Weaning of sedation and neurosurgical follow-up are advised.
5. Macrocytic Anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia, which is stable with a Hct of 32%. Daily Hct monitoring and transfusion for Hct"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who was admitted to the ICU following a motor vehicle accident (MVA) resulting in respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with ARDS and is currently on full ventilatory support. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving sedation. She is also experiencing hypotension, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), altered mental status, and macrocytic anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened overnight, with decreased compliance and tidal volumes on the ventilator. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as evidenced by MRSA and Klebsiella bacteria in the BAL and sputum cultures. The patient's lack of respiratory drive, low compliance, and agitation make weaning from the ventilator challenging.
2. Hypotension: The patient became acutely hypotensive overnight, and the cause is unclear. Differential diagnoses include septic shock from VAP, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drain, or neurogenic shock from a central nervous system (CNS) process. The patient is currently on neo (likely neomycin) for BP support.
3. Elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient's ICP is elevated due to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. A VP shunt"

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure following a motor vehicle accident. She underwent a tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic heart failure, hypertension, and depression. She has a scalp hematoma but no evidence of active bleed or infection. Her current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, fluoxetine, and H2 blockers for stress ulcers and VAP prophylaxis.

The patient experienced several significant events overnight. She had a small bleed in the left ventricle, but no intervention was recommended. Her head CT showed a new small amount of left intraventricular hemorrhage and no change in the degree of hydrocephalus since September 4th. There were also new findings of left mastoid air cells and middle ear opacification, suggesting otomastoiditis. 

The patient's respiratory status worsened overnight, with an increase in peak pressures and a decrease in compliance. She required higher levels of oxygen and increased ventilatory support. The arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a pH of 7.14, indicating respiratory acidosis. The EKG was unchanged, but there was pseudonormalization of ST depression. Chest X-ray revealed evidence of increased pulmonary edema. The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 50s,"

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with CAD, s/p tracheostomy following MVA admitted with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure in the setting of ARDS, VAP with a hospital course
   complicated by encephalopathy and intracranial hypertension s/p
   temporary ventriculostomy drain placement.
   #Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Due to ARDS.  Able to decrease driving
   pressures and respiratory rate with maintenance of adequate tidal
   volumes; repeat sputum Cx with GPC pairs/clusters c/w prior MRSA PNA;
   lack of respiratory drive, mental status, low compliance remain
   barriers to weaning
   -cont vanc/[**Last Name (un) 614**] for VAP given recurrent fever (day 9 of abx)
   -goal peak pressures goal<30)
   -wean sedation (10%/day) as Vt will tolerate, continue bolus
   sedation/anxiolytics (zyprexa) as gradual replacement for continuous
   infusion
   -cautious with high PEEP in the setting of pneumomediastinum
   #Hypotension
 Became acutely hypotensive overnight on [**9-11**], felt to
   be due to bolus sedation and increased PEEP during respiratory
   distress, briefly required neo gtt (now off); may be attributable to
   septic shock from VAP and/or neurogenic shock from underlying CNS
   process
   -restart neo gtt for MAP<55
   -f/u culture data (blood, sputum, urine, CSF)
   -consider A-line holiday v. resite (placed [**8-23**])
   -cautious fluid resuscitation given prior difficulty with
   oxygenation/ventilation in the setting of mild volume overload (CVP
   3-5)
   -cont hold BB, ACEi
   # Elevated Intracranial Pressure: ICP at goal <10; attributed to
   malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. Drain
   changed in OR on [**9-5**].  Blood-tinged CSF drainage with subsequent CT
   [**9-11**] showing small IVH of unclear clinical significance
   -appreciate neurosurg involvement
   -plan for VP shunt when infectious issues resolved (potentially OR
   [**9-15**] or [**9-16**])

   #Encephalopathy - difficult to assess given sedation requirements;
   reactive pupils but has some primitive reflexes
   - Continue to wean sedation as tolerated by minute ventilation
   - Neurosurg following
   - Will try for MRI again if patient stable
   # Macrocytic anemia: Hct low but stable

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, temporary ventriculostomy drain placement, and changes in sedation and respiratory support.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is unable to be weaned off mechanical ventilation due to low compliance and inadequate tidal volumes.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of acute hypotension overnight, which was initially attributed to bolus sedation and increased PEEP during respiratory distress. It may be related to septic shock from VAP or neurogenic shock from an underlying CNS process.
3. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's ICP is at goal <10, attributed to malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. A temporary ventriculostomy drain was placed, and subsequent CT scan showed a small intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) of unclear clinical significance.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is difficult to assess due to sedation requirements. Pupils are reactive, but some primitive reflexes are present.
5. Macrocytic anemia: The patient has a low"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure following a motor vehicle accident. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possibly due to fibroproliferative changes rather than an infectious cause. The patient's condition has worsened overnight, but compliance and tidal volume have continued to improve, resulting in less elevated peak pressures.

The patient has also been experiencing hypotension, which was initially thought to be due to septic shock from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or neurogenic shock from a central nervous system process. However, it is now believed that the hypotension may be related to bolused sedation and increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during respiratory distress.

Other medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum culture showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. VAP is a common complication in patients on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Preventive measures such as boots and early mobilization should be continued.

3. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from medical devices can lead to skin breakdown and pressure ulcers. Regular"

   summer after a MVC with poly-trauma, including SAH/SDH w/small midline
   shift and multiple orthopedic injuries, now with ARDS of unclear
   etiology (possibly MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia.)
 HYPOTENSION : currently off pressors. Her physiology is likely volume
   depletion exacerbated by bolus sedation as she responded to volume
   repletion and she has weaned off pressors with minimal other
   intervention.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]) Pulmonary physiology is
   actually improved over the past week. Her compliance is slowly
   improving. Decrease her driving pressure with a short term goal of
   decreasing her peak pressure to <30cm H2O and a longer term goal of
   decreasing her with a goal of liberating her from the vent.
 INFECTIOUS DISEASE : Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] had been on for 14 days; stopped
   on [**9-3**] on transfer from the CCU. CMV viral load was 3700 which is of
   unclear significance repeat negative.  BAL with cytopathic changes but
   at this piunt would not Rx with anti virals and complete ABX course.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): in setting of ICH and sedation,
   with periods looked like acute delirium. Repeat imaging shows small
   bleed, IUCP stable. Wean sedatin and follow clinical exam.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC: She did not do well
   with a CVP >8; maintain a low CVP and diurese as needed / as she is
   able.
 ANEMIA : Follow H/H. Transfuse for Hgb < 7. No e/o acute bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent two coronary artery bypass graft surgeries. She was admitted to the hospital after a motor vehicle collision, resulting in poly-trauma including subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma with a small midline shift. She now presents with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of unclear etiology, possibly due to MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient is experiencing hypotension, respiratory failure, infectious disease, altered mental status, and acute on chronic systolic heart failure. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/43 to 161/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is being mechanically ventilated with a peak pressure of 27 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 244 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of 0.27, increased lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L, and decreased platelet count of 239. Imaging studies reveal a small bleed in the brain but stable intracranial pressure. The patient is sedated and intubated, with plans to wean sedation and follow her clinical exam. She has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   70yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p CABG x 2 who was admitted to an OSH this
   summer after a MVC with poly-trauma, including SAH/SDH w/small midline
   shift and multiple orthopedic injuries, now with ARDS of unclear
   etiology (possibly MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia.)
 INFECTIOUS DISEASE
   Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] had been on for 14 days; stopped on [**9-3**] on transfer from
   the CCU. CMV viral load was 3700 which is of unclear significance
   will repeat; BAL revealed persistent Staph and Klebsiella in her lower
   respiratory tract cultures and will continue Vanc and Meropenem for
   this (last day is today - [**9-12**].) Galactomannan and beta-glucan are
   negative.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Continue to wean her Fentanyl and Versed with Zyprexa for break-through
   agitation / anxiety. Her underlying mental status remains unclear given
   she has not been evaluated off of sedation.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
   She did not do well with a CVP >8; maintain a low CVP and diurese as
   needed / as she is able.
 ANEMIA
   Follow H/H. Transfuse for Hgb < 7. No e/o acute bleeding.
 HYPOTENSION
   She had transient hypotension last night in the setting of her
   respiratory decompensation. She required pressors for several hours
   overnight, but is currently off pressors. Her physiology is likely
   volume depletion exacerbated by bolus sedation as she responded to
   volume repletion and she has weaned off pressors with minimal other
   intervention.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   She had an acute decompensation last night in the setting of being
   turned, it was transient and her pulmonary physiology is actually
   improved over the past week. Her compliance (as measured by the
   ventilator) has improved from 7 to 14 (several days ago) to 40 today.
   It
s unclear why her pulmonary compliance is improving; regardless, we
   will continue to attempt to decrease her driving pressure with a short
   term goal of decreasing her peak pressure to <30cm H2O and a longer
   term goal of decreasing her with a goal of liberating her from the
   vent.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone two coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) with multiple traumas, including subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)/subdural hematoma (SDH) with a small midline shift, and orthopedic injuries. The patient is currently diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of unclear etiology, possibly due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Klebsiella pneumonia.

The patient's infectious disease assessment indicates that she had been on vancomycin and meropenem for 14 days but was stopped on September 3rd upon transfer from the cardiac care unit (CCU). A CMV viral load of 3700 was recorded, which is of unclear significance and will be repeated. Lower respiratory tract cultures revealed persistent Staph and Klebsiella, so vancomycin and meropenem will continue to be administered.

Regarding the patient's altered mental status, which is not delirium, she is being weaned off sedation with Zyprexa for breakthrough agitation/anxiety. Her underlying mental status remains unclear since she has not been evaluated off of sedation.

The patient also has heart failure (CHF), specifically"

   Assessment and Plan
   70F with CAD, s/p tracheostomy following MVA admitted with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure in the setting of ARDS, VAP with a hospital course
   complicated by encephalopathy and intracranial hypertension s/p
   temporary ventriculostomy drain placement.
   #Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Due to ARDS.  Appears to have worsening
   pulmonary edema.  Repeat sputum Cx with GPC pairs/clusters c/w prior
   MRSA PNA; lack of respiratory drive, mental status, low compliance
   remain barriers to weaning.  Viral cultures suggestive of possible CMV
   infection.
   -BAL for viral culture looking for CMV
   -cont vanc/[**Last Name (un) 614**] for VAP given recurrent fever (day 9 of abx)
   -goal peak pressures goal<30
   -Lasix gtt
   -Consider dig loading for increased inotropy
   -Recheck ECHO
   -Continue to wean sedation as tolerated by minute ventilation, continue
   bolus sedation/anxiolytics (zyprexa) as gradual replacement for
   continuous infusion
   -cautious with high PEEP in the setting of pneumomediastinum
   -ID consult re: CMV
   -consider gancyclovir for CMV
   #Hypotension
 Became acutely hypotensive overnight on [**9-11**], felt to
   be due to bolus sedation and increased PEEP during respiratory
   distress, briefly required neo gtt (now off); may be attributable to
   septic shock from VAP and/or neurogenic shock from underlying CNS
   process
   -restart neo gtt for MAP<55
   -f/u culture data (blood, sputum, urine, CSF)
   -replaced A-line ([**9-13**])
   -cautious fluid resuscitation given prior difficulty with
   oxygenation/ventilation in the setting of mild volume overload (CVP
   3-5)
   -cont hold BB, ACEi
   # Elevated Intracranial Pressure: ICP at goal <10; attributed to
   malabsorptive hydrocephalus following intracranial bleeding. Drain
   changed in OR on [**9-5**].  Blood-tinged CSF drainage with subsequent CT
   [**9-11**] showing small IVH of unclear clinical significance
   -appreciate neurosurg involvement
   -plan for VP shunt when infectious issues resolved (potentially OR
   [**9-15**] or [**9-16**])
   -MRI ordered to eval for diffuse axonal injury but could not tolerate
   traveling to study due to low compliance & tidal volumes on vent
   -maintain ICP, goal <10
   -keppra at 1500 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - viral culture CSF for CMV
   #Encephalopathy - difficult to assess given sedation requirements;
   reactive pupils but has some primitive reflexes
   - Continue to wean sedation as tolerated by minute ventilation
   - Neurosurg following
   - Will try for MRI again if patient stable
   - viral culture for CMV
   # Macrocytic anemia: Hct low but stable
   - daily Hct
   -would defer transfusion unless Hct<21 assuming adequate oxygenation
   can be achieved with increases in PEEP/FiO2
   - guaiac all stools

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has undergone tracheostomy and temporary ventriculostomy drain placement. The patient has experienced worsening pulmonary edema, lack of respiratory drive, mental status changes, and low compliance, making it difficult to wean him off the ventilator. There are concerns about possible cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and further investigations are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient appears to have worsening pulmonary edema, indicating ongoing respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are necessary to ensure adequate gas exchange.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has shown recurrent fever, suggesting a possible bacterial infection despite antibiotic therapy. It is important to review the sputum cultures and consider changing antibiotics if necessary.

3. Possible CMV infection: There are indications of viral cultures suggestive of possible CMV infection. BAL for viral culture looking for CMV should be performed, and appropriate antiviral treatment, such as gancyclovir, should be considered.

4. Intracranial hypertension: The patient has elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), which requires close monitoring. The goal is to maintain ICP below "

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been on mechanical ventilation and has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has encephalopathy and intracranial hypertension, for which a temporary ventriculostomy drain was placed. He has been experiencing recurrent fever, suggesting possible CMV infection. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 110/52-172/74 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including sedatives, antibiotics, and antivirals. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue is ARDS, which can lead to severe hypoxemia and difficulty in oxygenation.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, indicating an infection acquired during mechanical ventilation. This increases the risk of further respiratory complications.
3. Intracranial hypertension: The patient has elevated intracranial pressure, which can lead to brain herniation if not managed properly.

","The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting twice. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a motor vehicle collision, resulting in multiple traumas including subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma with a small midline shift. She also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possibly caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Klebsiella pneumonia. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to ARDS, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status with increased intracranial pressure. She has been experiencing fevers, hypotension, and constipation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatinine (Cr), lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), along with decreased levels of hemoglobin (Hgb), platelets (Plt), and albumin. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, evolving secondary infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further deterioration in mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. 

Further management includes plans to perform bronchoscopy and obtain cultures, initiate diuresis, and balance fluid management. The patient's code"

The central venous pressure (CVP) is 14, and mixed venous oxygen saturation will be checked, along with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Digoxin loading is considered. Despite being on pressors, the patient will be tried on a Lasix drip to improve forward flow.

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   70yo woman with a h/o CAD s/p CABG x 2 who was admitted to an OSH this
   summer after a MVC with poly-trauma, including SAH/SDH w/small midline
   shift and multiple orthopedic injuries, now with ARDS of unclear
   etiology (possibly MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia.)
 HYPOTENSION : currently off pressors. Her physiology is likely volume
   depletion exacerbated by bolus sedation as she responded to volume
   repletion and she has weaned off pressors with minimal other
   intervention.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]) Pulmonary physiology is
   actually improved over the past week. Her compliance is slowly
   improving. Decrease her driving pressure with a short term goal of
   decreasing her peak pressure to <30cm H2O and a longer term goal of
   decreasing her with a goal of liberating her from the vent.
 INFECTIOUS DISEASE : Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] had been on for 14 days; stopped
   on [**9-3**] on transfer from the CCU. CMV viral load was 3700 which is of
   unclear significance repeat negative.  BAL with cytopathic changes but
   at this piunt would not Rx with anti virals and complete ABX course.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM): in setting of ICH and sedation,
   with periods looked like acute delirium. Repeat imaging shows small
   bleed, IUCP stable. Wean sedatin and follow clinical exam.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC: She did not do well
   with a CVP >8; maintain a low CVP and diurese as needed / as she is
   able.
 ANEMIA : Follow H/H. Transfuse for Hgb < 7. No e/o acute bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)/subdural hematoma (SDH) with a small midline shift and multiple orthopedic injuries. The patient is now experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of unclear etiology, possibly due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Klebsiella pneumonia. She also has impaired skin integrity, constipation, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The presence of MRSA and Klebsiella pneumonia increases the risk of infection, and the patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic illness and medication use may further compromise her immune response.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic heart failure (CHF) that may worsen due to fluid overload or inadequate cardiac function.
4. Constipation: The patient is at risk of developing constipation, which can lead to further complications such as impaction, pain, and infection.
