","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female presenting with urosepsis. She has been treated with antibiotics, specifically Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 126/52 mmHg, heart rate of 68 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Her temperature is within normal range.

The patient has a history of triple lumen placement, which was successfully positioned in the proper location. She also has a Foley catheter in place for urine drainage.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, indicating ongoing infection and tissue hypoperfusion. Troponin levels are slightly elevated, suggesting possible cardiac involvement. Kidney function is within normal limits.

Imaging reveals that the right internal jugular (IJ) line tip is in the superior vena cava (SVC), with no pneumothorax. There are small bilateral pleural effusions and mild cardiomegaly noted.

The patient is being managed for urosepsis, with ongoing administration of Zosyn and Cipro until the specific identification and sensitivities of the gram-negative rods (GNR) causing the infection are known. The plan includes discontinuing Vancomycin, monitoring central venous pressure (CVP), renal function, and daily surveillance"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a chief complaint of urosepsis. The patient has been weaned off levophed and is stable with blood pressures. The triple lumen has been pulled back 3 cm and is now in proper location. The patient has been started on ciprofloxacin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). There are no known drug allergies. The patient's lactate levels are within normal range. Troponin and CK levels are slightly elevated, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or injury. The patient has a first-degree AV block but is asymptomatic. The patient's hypertension is being managed by withholding antihypertensives in the setting of sepsis. Fluid balance shows an excess intake of 6,925 mL with an output of 1,800 mL. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, maintaining SpO2 at 100%. Physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles in the lungs, tachycardia, and irregularly irregular heart rhythm with pac's. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with present bowel sounds. Foley catheter is in place draining clear urine. Extremities are warm and well perfused. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated blood glucose levels. Imaging reveals the right internal jugular line tip"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a chief complaint of urosepsis. She has been weaned off levophed and her blood pressures have remained stable. The triple lumen catheter was pulled back about 3 cm and is now in a proper location. The patient's lactate levels are within normal range, and her troponin and CK levels have decreased. She is alert, oriented, and showing no acute distress. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 68 bpm and a blood pressure of 126/52 mmHg. She is on various medications including norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and prophylactic antibiotics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-gap acidosis: This could be due to volume resuscitation with normal saline. The plan is to allow it to autocorrect and consider LR if further bolus is required.
2. Demand ischemia: The patient has a bump in troponin and CK, with flat MB and no EKG changes. It is considered as possible demand ischemia in the setting of severe sepsis/hypotension. Acute management is not required at this time, but ASA on discharge for primary prevention will be considered, along with repeating pm CE's and EKG.
3. First-degree AV block: The patient is asymptomatic and will be monitored on telemetry.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female presenting with urosepsis. She has a history of chronic leg and thigh pain. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 111/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and awake with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals a central area of redness on the tongue, clear urine drainage from the Foley catheter, and pain upon movement in the right lateral thigh and calf. 

The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Her blood cultures are positive for gram-negative rods, which are sensitive to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, and tobramycin. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes and kidney function tests are within normal limits. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Urosepsis: The patient will continue with renally dosed ciprofloxacin and switch to oral administration. Daily surveillance cultures will be performed, and renal function will be monitored. Foley catheterization will be discontinued.
2. Mouth/tongue pain: Lidocaine or nys"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female presenting with urosepsis. She has a history of chronic leg and thigh pain following a recent right total knee replacement (TKR). The patient is currently on ciprofloxacin for her infection, which is sensitive to the gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteria found in her blood and urine cultures. 

The patient has been off pressors and her central venous line (CVL) has been disconnected. She is stable and complains of pain in her right lateral thigh and calf, but there are no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/46 to 130/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin at 8.7 g/dL, normal creatinine at 1.2 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose levels. Her troponin levels are slightly elevated, indicating potential cardiac involvement, but without significant EKG changes. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a central area of redness on her tongue, which may be due to oral thrush. There are no wheezes or abnormal breath"

","The patient is an 88-year-old female presenting with urosepsis. She has a history of chronic leg and thigh pain following recent right total knee replacement (TKR). The patient was started on ciprofloxacin and heparin sodium prophylaxis. She has been experiencing fluctuations in vital signs, with tachycardia, irregularly irregular heart rhythm with pacemakers, and low blood pressure. The patient's urine culture revealed the presence of gram-negative rods, and blood cultures are pending. The patient's electrolytes and kidney function are within normal limits. The patient is currently stable, with plans for transfer to the floor today.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Persistent sepsis and infection: The patient's blood cultures are still pending, and there is a possibility of ongoing infection.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient has shown signs of hypotension and tachycardia, which may indicate potential organ dysfunction, including cardiovascular and renal systems.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's recent TKR surgery puts her at risk for DVT, especially while immobilized in the ICU.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged bed rest in the ICU increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Delirium: Older adults with sepsis are at higher risk for delirium.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's baseline respiratory function should be monitored closely, as se"

","Summary:
Mrs. [Known lastname] is an 88-year-old female patient who presented with urosepsis. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including lower extremity pain related to recent right total knee replacement (TKR), non-gap acidosis, demand ischemia, first-degree AV block, and hypertension. The patient's blood culture is positive with gram-negative rods (GNR), and she has been on various antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient's initial presentation of urosepsis indicates a severe infection that can lead to complications such as septic shock, organ failure, and even death if not properly managed.
2. Lower Extremity Pain: The patient's chronic leg and thigh pain may worsen over time, leading to decreased mobility and potential complications like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pressure ulcers.
3. Non-gap Acidosis: The patient's non-gap acidosis could be a result of volume resuscitation with normal saline. If not managed appropriately, it may progress to severe metabolic acidosis, affecting vital organ functions.
4. Demand Ischemia: The patient's bump in troponin and CK levels, along with flat MB and no EKG changes, suggest possible demand ischemia. If left untreated, it could"

","Summary:
Mrs. [Known Lastname] is an 88-year-old female admitted with urosepsis. She has a history of chronic leg and thigh pain post right total knee replacement (TKR). She is currently on ciprofloxacin for an infection and has a central venous line (CVL) that was discontinued in the morning. The patient is stable and complains of morning pain. She has no known drug allergies. Her vital signs show a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. Her respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are within normal limits. The patient's weight has decreased since admission. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable central venous pressure (CVP). Fluid balance indicates a negative balance since 12 AM. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and creatinine levels. Blood cultures are pending for gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient has a Foley catheter in place, draining clear urine. Physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles in the lungs, tachycardia with irregularly irregular rhythm, and well-healed TKR incision without surrounding erythema or exudate. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with present bowel sounds. No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema is observed in the extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's blood gas analysis shows a non-gap metabolic acidosis, which may be due to recent volume resuscitation with normal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a chief complaint of urosepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on ciprofloxacin for treatment. The patient's medical history includes chronic leg and thigh pain, and she has undergone a recent right total knee replacement (TKR). 

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, heart rate is slightly elevated but within acceptable limits, blood pressure is stable, respiratory rate is normal, and oxygen saturation is at 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 65 kg at admission to 56.4 kg currently. 

Fluid balance shows a net loss of 326 mL over the past 24 hours. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg, which is within the normal range. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), and elevated blood glucose levels. The blood cultures are positive for gram-negative rods (GNR), and the preliminary sensitivity results indicate that ceftriaxone, gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin are sensitive. The patient also has pending MRSA screen and blood culture tests. 

The assessment and plan include continuing ciprof"

 SHOCK, OTHER secondary to urosepsis.  Growing pansensitive E. Coli
   (except bactrim). Now on cirprofloxicin.  She has had some mild
   nausea.  Abdominal exam benigh.  Will try to encourage po intake,
   consider switching to po cirpo if tolerated.  Discontinue foley.
 HYPONATREMIA:  Resolving with hydration/volume repletion and
   resolution of sepsis.  Persistently slightly down.  Appears dry so
   still may be component of hypovolemia hyponatremia.  Check urine lytes
   and osoms.
 RENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  Improving.  Good urine output.  Workup for RTA
   given persistently low bicarb.
