","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of recent right thalamic bleed, hypoxia, and aspiration pneumonia. He has impaired skin integrity, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and hypotension due to aspiration pneumonia and volume depletion. The patient is currently on 100% NRB with saturations ranging from 92-97%. He is being treated with vancomycin, levaquin, and flagyl. Tube feeds have been held, and the patient has DNR/DNI status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's current condition of impaired skin integrity and previous aspiration pneumonia indicate an increased risk for further episodes of aspiration, which can lead to recurrent pneumonia.
2. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): The patient's history of right thalamic bleed suggests a potential risk for additional bleeding in the brain, which can worsen neurological status and lead to complications such as increased intracranial pressure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to aspiration pneumonia and volume depletion. If not appropriately managed, this can result in inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
4. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis, which is a bacterial infection commonly associated with antibiotic use. If not treated effectively, it can lead to severe diarrhea, electrolyte imbalances, and even"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 75-year-old male, was admitted with hypoxia and altered mental status likely due to aspiration pneumonia. He had a witnessed aspiration event prior to the admission, and a repeat chest X-ray showed significant right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient required oxygen by 70% face tent, but his mental status has improved to baseline according to his family. 

The patient also has a history of right thalamic bleed, which is believed to be caused by hypertension and elevated INR. However, there is no current evidence of a new bleed or worsening of the prior bleed. 

Additionally, the patient has a fractured clavicle, C. diff colitis, a history of DVT, hyponatremia, CAD, and hypertension. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Impaired skin integrity
2. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
3. H/O hypotension (not shock)
4. H/O pneumonia, aspiration

The patient is currently being treated for aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics, including vancomycin and levofoxacin. His oxygen requirement has decreased to 50% face tent. The mental status is back to baseline, and there is no current evidence of new thalamic bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event and significant right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray indicate aspiration pneumonia. If left untreated or not managed properly,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with recent right thalamic bleed admitted with hypoxia and altered mental status likely due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient had a witnessed aspiration event immediately preceding his hypoxia and altered mental status, resulting in significant right lower lobe infiltrate on repeat chest X-ray. Oxygen supplementation with a face tent was increased to 70% and then decreased to 50% as his oxygenation improved. The patient's mental status has returned to baseline. He is being treated for aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin, levofoxacin, and flagyl. There is no current evidence of new bleed or worsening of the prior bleed. The patient's recent medical history includes hypertension, right fractured clavicle, Clostridium difficile colitis, and deep vein thrombosis. His laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, with otherwise normal values. Imaging reveals evidence of aspiration and no new thalamic bleeding. The patient's plan includes obtaining an old CT scan, monitoring neuro status, holding DVT prophylaxis, and restarting treatment dose anticoagulation once stable. Other plans include placing a sling for the fractured clavicle, restarting beta-blockers for hypertension, holding aspirin and lovenox, repleting electrolytes and nutrition, and providing appropriate prophylaxis and access. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he will be informed of any deterioration"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of aspiration pneumonia, thalamic bleed, hypoxia, fractured clavicle, C. diff colitis, DVT, hyponatremia, CAD, and hypertension. The patient requires oxygen through a face tent and has desaturations in the mid/high 80's when the mask is removed. Mental status has improved to baseline. The patient is on various medications including vancomycin, levoquin, and flagyl. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged bed rest or immobility.
2. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): The patient already has a right thalamic bleed, which can increase the risk of further ICH.
3. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension likely due to aspiration pneumonia and volume depletion.
4. C. diff colitis: The patient is currently being treated for C. diff with vancomycin and flagyl.
5. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT, although it is currently being held due to the acute bleed.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia that may be related to volume depletion.
7. Fractured clavicle: The patient has a fractured clavicle, which may cause discomfort and affect mobility.
8. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms.
9. CAD: The patient's cardiac condition is being held due to the current acute situation.
10. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure medications are being held.

Please note that these are potential complications based on the information provided in the progress note. The actual complications and their severity can only be determined through a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of right thalamic bleed, hypotension, pneumonia, and aspiration. He was admitted with hypoxia and altered mental status likely due to aspiration pneumonia. There is no evidence of new thalamic bleeding.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Aspiration pneumonia - The patient had a witnessed aspiration event, and he has developed significant right lower lobe infiltrate on the repeat chest X-ray. He requires high-flow oxygen and will be placed on a face tent. Medications include albuterol as needed, vancomycin, levofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and Zosyn will be added today due to the lack of improvement. Pulmonary toilet and frequent monitoring are also required. A sputum sample will be obtained today.
2. Right thalamic bleed - The patient likely experienced this bleed due to hypertension and an elevated INR. There is no current evidence of a new bleed or worsening of the prior bleed. The patient's mental status has returned to baseline. Old computed tomography (CT) scans are being reviewed, and two CT scans here are stable. Aspirin and heparin subcutaneous were restarted yesterday. Neurological status will be closely monitored, and neuro recommendations will be appreciated. Resuming treatment dose anticoagulation is too high of a risk given the significant bleed.
3. Right fractured clavicle - The patient will be"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with recent right thalamic bleed admitted with hypoxia and altered mental status likely aspiration pneumonia, no evidence of new thalamic bleeding. The patient has impaired skin integrity, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), history of hypotension (not shock), history of pneumonia, and aspiration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event and significant right lower lobe infiltrate on repeat chest X-ray indicate the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory distress, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.

2. Right thalamic bleed: The patient's history of hypertension and elevated INR suggests a risk for further bleeding. Although there is no current evidence of a new bleed or worsening of the prior bleed, close monitoring of the patient's neuro status is essential to detect any changes.

3. Right fractured clavicle: The patient has a fractured clavicle, which may affect mobility and respiratory function. Proper pain management and the use of a sling to support the affected arm are important for the patient's comfort and recovery.

4. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis: The patient has a history of C. diff infection, which is a common hospital-acquired condition. Treatment with oral vancomycin and a chronic long taper may be necessary to resolve the infection and prevent recurrence.

   [**4-20**] CXR:
   As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
   sided parenchymal opacities have massively increased in extent. They
   now occupy the entire right lung bases. The presence of a combined
   dense lung parenchyma and air bronchograms suggests pneumonia. Mild
   increase in density is also seen at the left lung bases. The presence
   of a small right-sided effusion cannot be excluded, no larger
   left-sided pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette is
   unchanged. Round linear structure in the left lung base is caused by a
   skin fold.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with recent right thalamic bleed admitted for hypoxia and altered mental status, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. There is no evidence of new thalamic bleed. The patient had a witnessed aspiration event immediately preceding his hypoxia and altered mental status, now with significant right lower lobe infiltrate on repeat chest X-ray. Zosyn was added to his regimen yesterday with significant clinical improvement today. 

Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient had a witnessed aspiration event, leading to hypoxia and altered mental status. He now has significant right lower lobe infiltrate on repeat chest X-ray, indicating aspiration pneumonia. 

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has positive bowel sounds and a gastrostomy tube in place, suggesting impaired skin integrity in the area of the tube insertion.

3. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has a history of hypertension and elevated INR, which likely contributed to a right thalamic bleed. However, there is no current evidence of a new bleed or worsening of the prior bleed, and the patient's mental status has returned to baseline.

4. Fractured clavicle: The patient has a right fractured clavicle. It is recommended to place a sling, provide standing Tylenol, and offer oxycodone as needed for pain management.

5. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient"

   Imaging: [**4-20**] CT Head:
   Compared to prior exam from [**2124-4-18**], there is no significant
   change in hyperdense focus in the right thalamus which may represent a
   hemorrhagic infarct.
   [**4-20**] CXR:
   As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing right
   sided parenchymal opacities have massively increased in extent. They
   now occupy the entire right lung bases. The presence of a combined
   dense lung parenchyma and air bronchograms suggests pneumonia. Mild
   increase in density is also seen at the left lung bases. The presence
   of a small right-sided effusion cannot be excluded, no larger
   left-sided pleural effusion. The size of the cardiac silhouette is
   unchanged. Round linear structure in the left lung base is caused by a
   skin fold.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with recent right thalamic bleed admitted with hypoxia and altered mental status likely due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient has impaired skin integrity, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), history of hypotension, pneumonia, aspiration, fractured clavicle, C. diff colitis, history of DVT, hyponatremia, CAD, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of infection, and potential sepsis.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and poor wound healing.
3. Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has a history of right thalamic bleed, which can lead to neurological deficits, increased intracranial pressure, and potential deterioration in mental status.
4. Fractured Clavicle: The patient has a fractured clavicle, which can cause pain, restricted movement, and potential complications such as pneumonia due to impaired coughing and clearance of secretions.
5. C. diff Colitis: The patient has C. diff colitis, which can lead to severe diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of complications.
6. History of DVT: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which"
