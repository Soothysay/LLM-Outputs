","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient has been admitted to the ICU with complaints of an intracranial bleed and confusion. They experienced itchiness after finishing the FFP infusion, which cleared spontaneously. The patient also had a poor gag reflex upon admission to the floor and is receiving all medications intravenously. The patient has allergies to aspirin and penicillins, but the type of reaction is unknown. 

The patient received a dose of Furosemide (Lasix) at 02:00 AM. No other changes have been made to the medical or family history. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 76-88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 94/42 to 118/70 mmHg, respiratory rate between 16-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,000 mL, including 626 mL of intravenous fluids, and an output of 2,000 mL, with 1,460 mL of urine output. Blood products totaling 576 mL were given, and the patient received 50 mL of IV fluids. 

Respiratory support is not required, and the patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 100% without any supplemental oxygen. An arterial blood gas (ABG)"

 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC
   73yo male on coumadin and plavix because of a mechanical aortic valve
   and prior stroke, now with a new left parietal hemorrhage.  Appears to
   be at baseline mental status and no neurosurgical intervention needed
   at this time.
   .
   #. Intraparenchymal Bleed: Patient has new left parietal hemorrhage,
   seems to be contralateral to recent stroke.  Neurologically he does not
   appear far off of his baseline except for possibly possibly increased
   confusion and ?new visual changes (right hemianopsia likely could be
   explained by a bleed in this area).  He requires significant help with
   his ADL's and is very forgetful at baseline and it remains unclear how
   this added bleed will affect his prognosis.  Neurosurgery dos not want
   to intervene but recommends reversal of his anticoagulation.  If
   surgical intervention becomes appropriate, it is not clear if this
   would be an option pursued by HCP.  Appearance of bleed somewhat
   concerning for ?bleed into mass, but cannot be completely charactized
   at current time.
   - ?repeat imaging in AM.
   - given appearance of bleed, rads/neurosurg recommending MRI to eval
   for >?underlying mass, though unable to get given mechanical valve.
   Does have presumed active prostate cancer, ?met from this or other
   primary malignancy.  Need to check into old records from [**Hospital1 1233**] re:
   any previous structural disease in this area (presumably with previous
   imaging there).
   - appreciate neurosurg recs.
   - Q1H neuro checks.
   - Keppra for prophylaxis.
   - Maintain SBP < 140.
   - Holding clopidogrel and coumadin; getting 2 units FFP.  f/u neurosurg
   recs re: eventual appropriate time to restart anticoag.  s/p 10 mg IV
   vitamin K at OSH.  Significant risks having either continued
   intracranial bleed and/or embolic stroke with mechanical valve off
   anticoagulation explained to daughter/HCP.
   .
   # Confusion.  Per daughter, not far from post-CVA baseline.  Baseline
   disorientation with need for basically 24 hour care at home.  Unclear
   that this has been truly affected by new bleed.  Presumably new
   baseline the result of this stroke; also consider NPH (incontinence,
   poor gait), leptomeningeal disease, rapid progression of other type of
   dementia, depression seems less likely.  No evidence that this is
   infectious CNS disease.
   - Check TSH and LFTs.
   - Consider LP given the above.
   - Consider neuro input.
   - Eventual [**Hospital1 238**] screening.
   - Eventual OT/PT, possible repeat swallow eval.
   .
   # Weight loss.  Patient with unclear amount of recent weight loss
   despite adequate PO intake and severe cachexia on exam.  Prostate
   cancer apparently diagnosed but with unclear management.  Has a few
   areas of mild lymphadenopathy.
   - OSH/PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - Consider CT torso to eval for undiagnosed malignancy.
   - Check PSA (if very elevated would explore for metastatic disease with
   ?brain met as above.
   - TSH.
   - Consider HIV if risk factors present.
   .
   #. CHF. Unclear status of this.  Mildly volume overloaded currently.
   Symptomatically appears to be stable.
   - Outside records.
   - ?need eventual beta blockade.
   - Lasix prn (particularly with blood products)
   .
   #. s/p mechanical AVR.  Daughter and patient do not know any more
   details about type of valve.
   - Oustide records.
   - Holding coumadin and reversing INR as above; neuro checks with
   increased risk for acute embolic stroke.
   .
   #. CAD.  Indeterminate troponin at OSH; no ECg changes, CK very low..
   - repeat enzymes in AM as trop 0.05 here.
   - Holding plavix (on due to ASA allergy)
   - ?eventual beta blockade or statin therapy.
   .
   # Microcytic anemia.
   - Check Fe studies.
   - Obtain baseline.
   .
   # DM.  Daughter reports on insulin but unclear how much.
   - med rec in AM when roommate/caretaker comes in.
   - ISS for now.
   .
   #. Lightheadedness.  Unable to describe further (not clearly vertigo).
   Admits to continued LH when asked, but otherwise does not complain of
   it.  [**Month (only) 51**] be feeling abnormal with change in vision likely due to new
   bleed.
   - continue to monitor.
   - neuro checks as above.
   .
   # ?LLL atelectasis vs. consolidation.  No clinical signs of pneumonia.
   - consider repeat CXR here, though holding off as not suspicion of
   infection at this point.
   .
   FEN: Had difficulty swallowing at baseline, though most recently has
   been off thickened liquids.  [**Month (only) 51**] need swallow consult to assess for
   further decline in swallowing capabilities, and then either PO diet or
   NG tube placement.
   .
   PPX:
   - Continue home PPI IV for now.
   - DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   CODE STATUS: Discussed with daughter.  Would like all acute care, but
   would probably not want long-term ventilation or intensive care.
   .
   EMERGENCY CONTACT: Daughter [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 113**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2875**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11182**] or
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11183**]).
   .
   DISPOSITION: ICU pending stabilized neuro exam.  Possibly to the floor
   in the AM if neuro check frequency can be decreased.  Eventually needs
   screening.

   Assessment and Plan
 INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE (ICH)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC
   73yo male on coumadin and plavix because of a mechanical aortic valve
   and prior stroke, now with a new left parietal hemorrhage.  Appears to
   be at baseline mental status and no neurosurgical intervention needed
   at this time.
   .
   #. Intraparenchymal Bleed: Patient has new left parietal hemorrhage,
   seems to be contralateral to recent stroke.  Most concerning at this
   time is his possible right-sided hemianopsia, which likely could be
   explained by a bleed in this area.  He requires significant help with
   his ADL's and is very forgetful at baseline and it remains unclear how
   this added bleed will affect his prognosis.  His frequent neuro checks
   are to allow for prompt surgical intervention, but it is unclear if
   surgical intervention becomes appropriate whether his daughter would
   pursue that option.  Also concerning is that the appearance of bleed is
   concerning for an underlying mass.
   - Repeat head CT w/ contrast to assess for interval change and evidence
   of an underlying mass.  He cannot get an MRI because of his mechanical
   valve.
   - appreciate neurosurg recs.
   - Q1H neuro checks for now.  [**Month (only) 51**] lengthen if surgery is not a realistic
   option.
   - Keppra for prophylaxis.
   - Maintain SBP < 140.
   - Holding clopidogrel and coumadin after he received vit K and FFP.
   Plan for now is at least 2 weeks off of anticoagulation.
   .
   # Weight loss.  Per daughter, patient has had weight-loss despite
   adequate PO intake.  Prostate cancer apparently diagnosed but with
   unclear management.  PSA is undetectable.  We need to contact his PCP
   to see if any work-up has been done to date.
   - OSH/PCP records for cancer screening.
   - Can begin with CXR for imaging.
   - Guaiac stools as patient has microcytic anemia.
   - TSH.
   - Consider HIV if risk factors present.
   .
   # Confusion.  Patient may have had confusion pre-dating the fatigue
   that was the presenting symptom of this bleed.  No evidence that this
   is infectious CNS disease, so we will defer an LP.  We will try to
   gather more information today from the daughter and roommate.  He will
   likely eventually need higher level care as he was not doing well at
   home before this event.
   - Check TSH and LFTs.
   - If situation remains unclear after gathering information, could
   consider consulting neurology.
   - Eventual [**Hospital1 238**] screening.
   - Eventual OT/PT, possible repeat swallow eval.
   .
   #. CHF. Symptomatically stable, though may have been overloaded on
   initial exam.  He responded well to lasix.
   - Outside records.
   - Lasix prn (particularly with blood products)
   .
   #. s/p mechanical AVR/anticoagulation.  Daughter and patient do not
   know any more details about type of valve.
   - Oustide records.
   - Holding coumadin and reversing INR as above; neuro checks with
   increased risk for acute embolic stroke.
   .
   #. CAD.  Indeterminate troponin at OSH; no ECg changes, CK very low.
   - Recheck ECG today.
   - troponin has been stable at 0.05
   - Holding plavix (on due to ASA allergy)
   .
   # Microcytic anemia.
   - Check Fe studies.
   - Obtain baseline to verify for acute change.
   .
   # DM.  Daughter reports on insulin but unclear how much.
   - med rec in AM when roommate/caretaker comes in.
   - ISS for now.
   .
   FEN: Had difficulty swallowing at baseline, though most recently has
   been off thickened liquids.  Given his cachexia, we will place a
   Dobhoff today to allow the initiation of tube feeds.  He may need
   swallow consult to assess for further decline in swallowing
   capabilities so that we can determine an appropriate diet.
   .
   PPX:
   - Continue home PPI IV for now.
   - DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   CODE STATUS: Discussed with daughter.  Would like all acute care, but
   would probably not want long-term ventilation or intensive care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of mechanical aortic valve, prior stroke, and chronic diastolic heart failure. He presented with intracranial bleed and confusion. He has new left parietal hemorrhage, right-sided hemianopsia, and altered mental status. The patient's baseline mental status is not clear, and there are concerns about his prognosis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving Furosemide infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a history of chronic weight loss, microcytic anemia, prostate cancer, and diabetes. He is also on anticoagulation therapy due to his mechanical valve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal bleed: The patient already has a new left parietal hemorrhage, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, and potential need for neurosurgical intervention.
2. Right-sided hemianopsia: The patient's visual field loss on the right side can affect his daily activities and quality of life.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion and forgetfulness may worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and difficulty with activities of daily living.
4. Chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's heart condition can lead to symptoms of congestion such as shortness of breath, peripheral edema, and potential exacerbations.

The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of mechanical aortic valve, prior stroke, and type II diabetes mellitus. He presented with weakness and was found to have an intracranial bleed, specifically a left parietal hemorrhage. The patient also has a history of prostate cancer with an undetectable PSA level and coronary artery disease. He is currently experiencing mild diffuse pain in his abdomen, difficulty swallowing, and has a right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray suggestive of aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 111/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is alert and oriented to person and year but not date or place. Neurological examination reveals decreased vision on the right side, preserved sensation throughout, and symmetric strength with 4/5 strength in both lower extremities. Gait assessment has not been performed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 240, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 130 mg/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a male with a chief complaint of weakness and intracranial bleed. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, stroke, coronary artery disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, altered mental status, and chronic heart failure. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on respiratory support with no device, and their ABG results are pending. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood cultures were drawn due to a low-grade fever. The patient's creatinine and blood glucose levels are within normal limits. Other lab results, including liver function tests and electrolytes, are also within normal limits. 

The patient has been given ice chips, which were well tolerated. The patient's chest X-ray shows right lower lobe opacification, suggesting aspiration pneumonitis. The CT head with contrast shows an unchanged hematoma with surrounding vasogenic edema, but no obvious underlying mass. 

The family is unsure about the goals of care, and there is a discussion regarding the frequency of neuro checks. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, prostate cancer, stroke, coronary artery disease, intracranial hemorrhage, altered mental status, and chronic diastolic heart failure. He presented with weakness and intracranial bleeding. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing low-grade fever, right lower lobe opacification suggesting aspiration pneumonitis, and a 1cm area of nonspecific enhancement on MRI brain that cannot be ruled out for neoplastic/inflammatory disease (unlikely).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe infection: The patient's low-grade fever and aspiration pneumonitis indicate a possible severe infection in the respiratory system.
2. Neurological complications: Given the patient's history of intracranial hemorrhage and altered mental status, there is a risk of further neurological complications such as seizures or worsening of neurological function.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and chronic diastolic heart failure puts him at risk for cardiovascular complications like heart failure exacerbation or arrhythmias.
4. Cancer progression: Although the MRI brain does not definitively indicate neoplastic disease, the patient's history of prostate cancer raises concerns about potential cancer progression or metastasis.
5. Poor glycemic control: The patient's history of diabetes mellitus type II suggests the need for close monitoring and management of blood glucose levels to prevent hypergly"

   73yo male on coumadin and plavix because of a mechanical aortic valve
   and prior stroke, now with a new left parietal hemorrhage.  Appears to
   be at baseline mental status and no neurosurgical intervention needed
   at this time.
   .
   #. Intraparenchymal Bleed: New left parietal hemorrhage, seems to be
   contralateral to recent stroke.  Most concerning at this time is his
   possible right-sided hemianopsia, which likely could be explained by a
   bleed in this area.  He requires significant help with his ADL's and is
   very forgetful at baseline and it remains unclear how this added bleed
   will affect his prognosis.  There is concern given his weight-loss and
   bleed for malignancy, but it is reassuring that he had an MRI at the
   start of [**Month (only) 539**] without clear evidence of malignancy.
   - appreciate neurosurg recs.
   - Q4hr neuron checks.
   - Keppra for prophylaxis.
   - Maintain SBP < 140.
   - Should have 2 weeks off of anticoagulation, then reassess.
   - Should be able to be called out to floor today.
   .
   # Fever/bacteremia: Patient had low-grade temperature, appearance of
   aspiration on CXR and now a positive blood culture.  Started on
   clindamycin for possible anaerobic infection.  Now with the gram
   positive cocci in [**2-5**] bottles, we need to broaden coverage with IV

   a contaminant.
   - Repeat blood cultures
   - IV vancomycin 1gm Q12hrs pending speciation.

   # Poor nutrition:  Per family he was eating normally at home, but there
   is concern for aspiration pneumonitis on his chest x-ray and he has a
   poor gag reflex per nursing.  Has a history of prostate cancer but his
   PSA is undetectable.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has been no work-up of his weight

   - Speech and swallow suggested thickened liquids and a video swallow
   study.
   - Once they have given final suggestions, can get a nutrition consult.

   #. CHF. Symptomatically stable, though may have been overloaded on
   initial exam.  He responded well to lasix and now looks slightly dry on
   exam.  We will encourage PO intake with a goal of even to slightly

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Intraparenchymal bleed: The patient has a new left parietal hemorrhage, which is concerning and could potentially worsen his condition. This may require neurosurgical intervention.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows right lower lobe opacification, suggesting aspiration pneumonitis. This can be a serious complication if not properly managed.

3. Bacteremia and sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture and is febrile. There is a concern for a possible anaerobic infection, and the coverage for gram-positive cocci needs to be broadened with IV vancomycin.

4. Poor nutrition: The patient may have difficulty swallowing due to his altered mental status and poor gag reflex. This increases the risk of aspiration and malnutrition.

5. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient may have chronic diastolic heart failure, and it is important to monitor his fluid status and encourage oral intake.

6. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's history of mechanical aortic valve and prior stroke suggest underlying CAD. The recent troponin results are stable, but the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of cardiac complications.

7. Microcytic anemia: The patient's iron studies suggest chronic inflammation, which could be contributing to his microcytic anemia. Further evaluation and"

   at this time.

   #. Intraparenchymal Bleed: New left parietal hemorrhage, seems to be
   contralateral to recent stroke.  Most concerning at this time is his
   possible right-sided hemianopsia, which likely could be explained by a
   bleed in this area.  He requires significant help with his ADL's and is
   very forgetful at baseline and it remains unclear how this added bleed
   will affect his prognosis.  There is concern given his weight-loss and
   bleed for malignancy, but he cannot get an MRI because of his
   mechanical valve.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of diabetes, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, prostate cancer, stroke, and chronic heart failure. He presented with weakness and intracranial bleeding. The patient has been experiencing low-grade fever, right lower lobe opacification suggesting aspiration pneumonia, and a prior left temporal-occipital infarction. His vital signs are stable, but he has diffuse weakness and decreased vision on the right side. The patient's mental status is slow in responding to questions. Laboratory results show microcytic anemia and anemia of chronic disease. Imaging studies reveal a new left parietal hemorrhage without evidence of an underlying mass. The patient requires assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and is forgetful at baseline. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal bleed: The patient has a new left parietal hemorrhage which may affect his prognosis and could lead to further neurological deficits.
2. Malignancy: There is concern for malignancy due to weight loss and the intracranial bleed, but the patient cannot undergo an MRI due to his mechanical valve.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's right lower lobe opacification suggests aspiration pneumonitis. This can lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a male with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, a history of cancer (prostate), cerebrovascular accident (stroke), coronary artery disease (CAD), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and heart failure (CHF). The patient presented to the ICU with altered mental status, which is now close to baseline. He has difficulty taking oral medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 125/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is receiving nutrition and glycemic control through regular insulin sliding scale. He has two central lines in place for medication administration. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient is also being covered for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin. The patient's laboratory results are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and troponin T level. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
