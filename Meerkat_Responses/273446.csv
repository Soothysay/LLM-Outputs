","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of depression/anxiety, recent parathyroid surgery, and agitation/altered mental status in the setting of aspirin ingestion. She presented with decreased hearing bilaterally and no urgent need for dialysis.

The plan includes urine alkalinization with Q1 hour urine pH (goal >8), D5W with 150mEq NaBicarb/L at 125cc/hr Goal SERUM pH 7.45-7.55, and follow ASA levels q4hrs until significantly decreased. It is important to avoid sedating medications as they may decrease compensatory respiratory drive.

The patient appears to have acute-on-subacute confusion, possibly due to thyrotoxicosis vs. manic episode vs. serotonin syndrome, which precipitated a suicide attempt with acute exacerbation by ASA toxicity. The treatment plan includes treating ASA toxicity as mentioned above, measurement of synthroid levels, holding synthroid, hydration, psychiatric consultation, and continued holding of SSRIs and antipsychotics.

The patient is also being evaluated for suicide attempt/depression, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and cardiomyopathy. The plan includes holding home lisinopril, permissive hyperglycemia, fingerstick glucose monitoring, holding metformin, and considering insulin therapy for persistent fasting blood sugar (FSBS) >200.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of depression/anxiety, recent parathyroid surgery, and ingestion of aspirin. She presents with agitation, altered mental status, and decreased hearing bilaterally. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, blood pressure ranging from 103-149 mmHg, heart rate between 66-118 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. She is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and has a systolic murmur. Physical examination reveals anxiety, no edema, and normal peripheral pulses.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being treated for multiple conditions, including aspirin overdose, altered mental status, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus type II, hyperlipidemia, and cardiomyopathy. She requires urine alkalinization, intravenous fluids, and close monitoring of serum pH. ASA level should be followed, and sedating medications should be avoided. Psychiatric recommendations are also mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient may experience complications related to her conditions such as:
1. Aspirin overdose: Continued monitoring of serum pH and urine pH, along with the administration of D5W with 150m"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of depression/anxiety, recent parathyroid surgery, and agitation/altered mental status in the setting of aspirin ingestion.
- The patient's ASA level is decreasing slowly, but there are no signs of acute renal failure, seizures, or significant improvement in mental status. The patient still complains of decreased hearing bilaterally and does not require urgent dialysis.
- The patient's altered mental status seems to have resolved, and she is at her baseline mental status.
- The patient is suspected of attempting suicide due to depression and has been sectioned, awaiting placement in a psychiatric bed.
- The patient has hypertension, for which Lisinopril will be restarted today due to some elevated blood pressures.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, with permissive hyperglycemia for now. Glucose levels will be monitored with fingersticks, metformin will be held, and insulin will be given if the fasting serum blood sugar (FSBS) remains above 200.
- The patient has hyperthyroidism, as indicated by a low TSH level, possibly representing a Synthroid overdose. This will be discussed with the endocrinology team to determine if Synthroid should be measured as part of the free T4.
- The patient also has hyperlipidemia, and Lipitor will be held"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of depression/anxiety, recent parathyroid surgery, and agitation/altered mental status in the setting of aspirin ingestion. The patient's current condition includes decreased hearing bilaterally and no urgent need for dialysis.

The assessment and plan section highlights several medical concerns:
1. Aspirin overdose: The patient's ASA levels are decreasing slowly, and there are no signs of acute renal failure, seizures, or mental status changes. Urine alkalinization and hydration with D5W and 150mEq NaBicarb/L are being administered to manage the overdose.
2. Altered mental status: The patient appears to have acute-on-subacute confusion, possibly due to thyrotoxicosis, manic episode, or serotonin syndrome. Treatment includes managing ASA toxicity, measuring thyroid hormone levels, holding synthroid, and providing hydration.
3. Suicide attempt/depression: The patient's SSRIs and antipsychotics are being held, and a psych consult is planned.
4. Hypertension: The patient's home lisinopril is being held due to relative hypotension and overdose.
5. Diabetes mellitus: Permissive hyperglycemia is allowed, with fingersticks every 4 hours. Metformin is being held, and insulin may be required for persistent fasting blood sugar (FSBS) levels above 200.

   Assessment and Plan
   50 yo female with history of depression/anxiety and worsening symptoms
   of agitation/irritation at home now admitted with ASA ingestion and
   toxicity in the setting of self-medication attempts for poor sleep.
   1)ASA Ingestion
Has had encouraging trend down in ASA levels following
   HCO3- Rx.  No evidence of acute toxicity at this time.
   -No ASA
   -Levels trended down
   2)Altered Mental Status/Anxiety-
   -Psych in to eval patient
   -Will need to consider titration of medication and perhaps in inpatient
   setting given failure of outpatient setting
   3)Tachyardia
called by cardiology with concern for possible Vt on ECG
   from 2 days ago.
   Patient with stabilization of HR, known LBBB and by our interpretation
   do not seen Vt clearly.
   -Will follow up on final read of ECG
   -Will consider further evaluation baed on clinical course and final ECG

","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of depression/anxiety who was admitted with ASA ingestion and toxicity due to self-medication attempts for poor sleep. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 80 bpm (normal range: 66-118 bpm), blood pressure of 162/86 mmHg (normal range: 55-124 mmHg), respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (normal range: 17-35 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support but does not require supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is overweight/obese, has a systolic murmur, diminished breath sounds on the right side, and symmetric chest expansion. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and her skin has not been assessed. Neurologically, the patient responds appropriately but movement, tone, and sensation have not been assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.1 thousand/mm³ (normal range: 5.7-10.5 thousand/mm³), hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL), platelet count of 234 thousand/mm³ (normal range: 217-400 thousand/mm³), creat"
