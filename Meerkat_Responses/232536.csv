","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, admitted with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure.
- The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has a PICC line inserted.
- Blood cultures were taken and the patient's imaging showed diffuse pancreatic edema and possible necrosis.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have an elevated respiratory rate and low oxygen saturation.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and blood glucose levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient has been febrile despite extensive workup for infections, including negative pleural fluid culture.
- The plan includes weaning off sedation and attempting to transition to pressure support ventilation, considering the use of Lasix if there is no improvement.
- Antibiotics will be stopped and monitored, with the possibility of restarting them if the patient decompensates.
- Further investigations, such as repeating cultures, sending stool for C. diff, and considering surgery for pseudocyst aspiration, are also planned.
- The patient's chronic alcohol abuse requires monitoring for withdrawal, but since they have been hospitalized for more than two weeks, they are outside of the window for withdrawal symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if they are unable to be weaned off the ventilator, leading to further lung complications.

   48 yo M with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: It is unclear from the record what has been the
   barrier to weaning off of the vent. Per report CXR clear except for
   bilateral pleural effusions with negative culture on pleural fluid. CXR
   with opacities resembling pleural effusions. Admission ABG indicated
   mild alkalosis and fair oxygenation implying extraparenchymal fluid
   collection. RSBI on [**4-25**] is 76.
   - wean sedation and attempt to wean to pressure support
   - Can consider Lasix drip if no improvement on lighter sedation
   .
   # Fevers: Exhaustive w/u at OSH (bcx, ucx, [**Female First Name (un) **], LP, pseudocyst
   drainage). Will continue to follow their culture data. ?infected
   pseudocyst that has yet to be drained. Other noninfectious
   possibilities: malignancy (h/o renal mass, though not commented on on
   abdominal CT scan), drug fever (haldol, seroquel, lexapro),
   inflammatory condition.
   - Stop all antibiotics and monitor fever curve
   - Restart IV Vanco/Meropenem if decompensates --> indication is
   necrotizing pancreatitis
   - Resend cultures (blood, urine)
   - Send stool for C.dif
   - Surgery c/s in am re: ?need for further aspiration of pseudocyst
   - resite CVL, culture tip when access is obtained
   - hold psych meds including seroquel, haldol, lexapro
   .
   # Acute pancreatitis: Per OSH records lipase now <50. Abdomen is soft
   on exam. ?evolving pseudocyst compressing stomach on most recent CT Abd
   from OSH
   - NPO for now; place nasojejunal tube after [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult, start feeds
   if medical management
   - surgery consult in the morning
   - repeat labs now

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic ethanol abuse who is being treated for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. A PICC line was inserted for access.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 136/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal ventilation. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of +602 mL and blood products transfused totaling 270 mL.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count at 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin at 9.5 g/dL, blood glucose at 154 mg/dL, and elevated levels of AST, ALT, and LDH. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is not clearly defined, but there are bilateral pleural effusions present. The plan is to wean sedation and attempt to wean the patient to pressure support ventilation. Lasix drip may be considered if there is no improvement.
2. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers despite an extensive workup. Cultures are being monitored, and antibiotics will be restarted if the patient decompensates, especially"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic EtOH abuse who has been admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pain (foot, abdomen), intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, and obesity. There is no current evidence of acute pneumonia. The plan is to maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor arterial blood gas (ABG), monitor respiratory rate (RR), and monitor oxygen saturation (SaO2). A follow-up chest X-ray (CXR) is also recommended. Daily wake-up and monitoring of the respiratory system's ability to clear secretions (RSBI) will be done.

The patient has clinical improvement in acute pancreatitis, but with radiographic evidence for pseudocyst. Supportive care will be continued, and General Surgery will be consulted for evaluation. The patient has persistent fevers, and numerous concerns including pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, bacteremia (Streptococcus), urinary tract infection (Klebsiella), line-related infection, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and medications/antibiotics. Monitoring will be done, currently off antimicrobials, and the line will be resighted. Follow-up cultures will be obtained.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yom with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pain (foot, abd),
   intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, obesity.  No
   current evidence for acute pneumonia.  Maintain mechanical ventilation,
   monitor ABG, monitor RR, monitor SaO2.  F/U CXR.  Daily wake up,
   monitor RSBI.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- clinical improvement, labs improved, but with
   radiographic evidence for pseudocyst.  Consider repeat imaging.
   Continue supportive care.  General Surgery to evaluate.
   FEVERS -- persistent.  Numerous concerns, including panreatitis,
   pancreatitic pseudocyst, bacteremia (strept), UTI (Klebsiella),
   line-related, C. diff, medications/antibiotics.  Monitor, currently off
   antimicrobials.  Resight line.  F/U cultures.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- would initiate enteral feedings.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Plan net negative balance
   over net 24 hrs, if tolerates.
   LEFT FOOT TRAUMA -- would check x-ray, Orthopedic consult.
   EtOH ABUSE --

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse being treated in the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

Key findings from the note include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to multifactorial causes such as pain, intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, and obesity. Mechanical ventilation is being maintained, and the patient's ABG, RR, and SaO2 are being monitored.
2. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's clinical improvement indicates that the pancreatitis is responding to treatment; however, there is evidence of a pseudocyst formation. Repeat imaging may be necessary, and general surgery consultation is recommended.
3. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, which could be due to various reasons including pancreatitis, pseudocyst, bacteremia (specifically Streptococcus), urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Klebsiella, line-related infection, Clostridium difficile infection, or medication/antibiotics. Cultures are being monitored, and the patient is currently off antimicrobials.
4. Nutritional support: Enteral feedings should be initiated.
5. Fluid balance: A negative fluid balance is desired over the next 24 hours if tolerated.
6. Left foot trauma: X-ray and orthopedic consultation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse who is being treated in the ICU for acute pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been febrile with temperatures ranging from 38.6 to 101.5 degrees Celsius. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 50%, PEEP 8 cmH2O, and PS 10 cmH2O. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he has been started on IV meropenem due to persistent fevers. He also has a large pseudocyst in his pancreas with evidence of pancreatic necrosis, as seen on CT torso. The patient's oxygenation remains stable, and he has been placed on heparin gtt for suspected PE. He has a history of a left metatarsal fracture and chronic alcohol abuse. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and he is being closely monitored for clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The barrier to weaning off the vent is unclear, but there are bilateral pleural effusions with negative culture on pleural fluid. The patient's RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) is low at 22, indicating a need for further evaluation and possibly a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The barrier to weaning off the ventilator includes a pulmonary embolism (PE), pleural effusions, and restrictive physiology caused by elevated diaphragm and pseudocyst. The patient's RSBI is low, and he has failed spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) with desaturation to 80%. Daily SBTs will be performed, and the patient may be extubated to BiPAP when ready. Heparin will be continued for PE management.

2. Fevers: Despite extensive workup at the previous hospital, including blood cultures, urine cultures, and drainage of the pseudocyst, the cause of the persistent fevers remains unidentified. Cultures will be followed, and other noninfectious possibilities such as malignancy, drug fever, or inflammatory conditions will be considered. IV meropenem has been restarted due to the patient's fevers, and cultures have been resent.

3. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's lipase levels indicate ongoing acute pancreatitis, with evidence of pancreatic necrosis and a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach. Surgical recommendations will be obtained, and decisions regarding ent"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. He is currently on meropenem, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The patient has a CT scan revealing pancreatic necrosis and pseudocyst, as well as an incidental ventral hernia with a loop of bowel. Additionally, a CT chest demonstrates evidence of a pulmonary embolism in the right lower lobe, along with a left pleural effusion. The patient is now on heparin, an anticoagulant.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain (L foot, abdomen), and obesity. The plan is to maintain mechanical ventilation and monitor ABG, RR, and SaO2. A follow-up chest X-ray is also recommended. Daily wake-up and monitoring of RSBI (respiratory system compliance and resistance index) will be done.
2. Acute Pancreatitis: Although the patient's labs have improved, there is radiographic evidence for a pseudocyst. Supportive care will be continued, and General Surgery will be consulted for further evaluation.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient likely has a pulmonary embolism, which"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. A CT scan revealed pancreatic necrosis and pseudocyst formation. Additionally, an incidental ventral hernia with a loop of bowel was found. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/83 to 169/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, and PaO2 of 105 mmHg. 

Physical examination findings include minimal pain in the neck, right lower extremity edema, and left lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure due to multiple factors including pulmonary embolism, intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain, and obesity. The patient is being maintained on mechanical ventilation and will continue to be monitored closely. 

Other assessments and plans include acute pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic EtOH abuse who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including a pulmonary embolism (PE), extensive peripancreatic fluid and pancreatic necrosis due to acute pancreatitis, a small left pleural effusion, and a small ventral hernia. He also has a history of chronic alcohol abuse and a recent left metatarsal fracture.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors such as PE, pleural effusions, and restrictive physiology caused by elevated diaphragm and a pseudocyst. The patient's fevers are most likely due to pancreatic necrosis, but other noninfectious possibilities are also being considered. 

The patient's acute pancreatitis is evident by elevated lipase levels, and his abdomen is soft on examination. The CT torso shows a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach and evidence of pancreatic necrosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if the underlying causes such as PE, effusions, and restrictive physiology are not adequately addressed. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) should be performed to assess readiness for extubation. If the patient fails SBT, alternative options like transitioning to bilevel positive air"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic EtOH abuse who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a NJ feeding tube, restart of IV meropenem, and initiation of heparin therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 162/77 mmHg to 171/105 mmHg, heart rate between 76-106 bpm, respiratory rate of 8-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct, and normal platelet count. Imaging studies reveal filling defects within the right lower lobe and middle lobe pulmonary arteries, indicative of a pulmonary embolism (PE). There is also evidence of pancreatitis with extensive peripancreatic fluid, pancreatic necrosis within the head, and a large pancreatic pseudocyst anterior to the pancreas. Additionally, there is a small ventral hernia containing loops of small bowel with no evidence of obstruction and a small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yom with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain (L foot,
   abdomen), and obesity.  No current evidence for acute pneumonia.
   Remains hypoxemic, requiring high FiO2 --> hope to work towards 40%
   prior to extubation trial.   Maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor
   ABG, monitor RR, monitor SaO2.  F/U CXR.  Daily wake up, monitor RSBI.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- clinical improvement, labs improved, but with
   radiographic evidence for pseudocyst.  Consider repeat imaging.
   Continue supportive care.  General Surgery to evaluate.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- likely responsible for fevers and respiratory
   failure.
   FEVERS -- persistent.  Attributed to panreatitis (necrosis),
   pancreatitic pseudocyst, bacteremia (strept), UTI (Klebsiella), and now
   evidence for pulmonary embolism.  Monitor.  Currently on Meropenem
   alone.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K >4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- would initiate enteral feedings via post-pyloric
   tube.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Plan net negative balance
   over net 24 hrs, if tolerates.
   LEFT FOOT TRAUMA -- Fracture by radiographs.  Orthopedic consult
   recommended boot in place.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Remains on benzodiazepines.  Beyond window for
   DTs.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic EtOH abuse who was admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. 

The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature (39°C), tachycardia (HR: 103 bpm), hypertension (BP: 179/108 mmHg), tachypnea (RR: 31 breaths/min), and hypoxemia (SpO2: 92%). The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he is overweight with trace edema in both lower extremities.

On physical examination, the patient's general appearance is well-nourished, not in acute distress, and obese. His eyes are normal, with no conjunctival edema or sclera icterus. His lungs are clear bilaterally without wheezes or crackles. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. There is no distension or tenderness. His extremities show trace edema without cyanosis or clubbing. His skin is warm and dry without rash or jaundice. Neurologically, he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal movement and tone.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 10.5, slightly low hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL,"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yom with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain (L foot,
   abdomen), and obesity.  No current evidence for acute pneumonia.
   Remains hypoxemic, requiring high FiO2 --> hope to work towards 40%
   prior to extubation trial.   Maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor
   ABG, monitor RR, monitor SaO2.  F/U CXR.  Daily wake up, monitor RSBI.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- clinical improvement, labs improved, but with
   radiographic evidence for pseudocyst.  Consider repeat imaging.
   Continue supportive care.  General Surgery to evaluate.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- likely responsible for fevers and respiratory
   failure.
   FEVERS -- persistent.  Attributed to panreatitis (necrosis),
   pancreatitic pseudocyst, bacteremia (strept), UTI (Klebsiella), and now
   evidence for pulmonary embolism.  Monitor.  Currently on Meropenem
   alone.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K >4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- would initiate enteral feedings via post-pyloric
   tube.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Plan net negative balance
   over net 24 hrs, if tolerates.
   LEFT FOOT TRAUMA -- Fracture by radiographs.  Orthopedic consult
   recommended boot in place.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Remains on benzodiazepines.  Beyond window for
   DTs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic EtOH abuse, who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, which is multifactorial including pulmonary embolism, intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain, and obesity. The patient's labs show signs of hypokalemia, and there is evidence of a pulmonary embolism. The patient also has a fracture in the left foot, and nutritional support is being initiated via post-pyloric tube due to the patient's inability to tolerate enteral feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and requires close monitoring and management. Ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation is crucial.
2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which may lead to complications such as infection, pseudocyst formation, and organ dysfunction.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has evidence of a pulmonary embolism, which can cause further respiratory distress and potentially lead to circulatory collapse if not managed appropriately.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels need to be corrected to avoid cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
5. Left Foot Fracture: The patient has a fracture in the left foot, which requires orth"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 116/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, elevated platelet count, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's ABG results indicate mild alkalosis and fair oxygenation.

The patient's medical conditions include acute pancreatitis, respiratory failure, suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), pleural effusions, and chronic alcohol abuse. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors including PE, pleural effusions, and restrictive physiology caused by elevated diaphragm and pseudocyst. The patient's fevers are most likely from pancreatic necrosis, but other noninfectious possibilities such as malignancy or drug fever have not been ruled out.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, decreased respiratory rate, and low oxygen saturation.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and is being weaned off sedation. There are concerns about the barrier to weaning off the vent, with bilateral pleural effusions and negative culture on pleural fluid. The patient's ABG indicates mild alkalosis and fair oxygenation, suggesting extraparenchymal fluid collection. The patient has undergone diuresis with lasix and has shown improvement in respiratory status.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, normal creatinine, and mildly elevated glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, fevers, and acute pancreatitis. The respiratory failure is likely due to pleural effusions and restrictive physiology. The fevers are most likely from pancreatic necrosis. The patient has a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach and evidence of pancreatic necrosis.

The patient also has a pulmonary embolism (PE) as seen on CT torso, and the oxygenation remains stable on minimal PEEP on vent. The patient is being started on heparin.

The patient's chronic alcohol abuse is being managed with midazolam drip, and plans are being made to wean sedation as part of weaning off the vent. The patient is also being monitored for withdrawal symptoms.

The patient's fracture boot continues for the left metatarsal fracture, and ortho recs are being followed. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the patient does not respond to weaning attempts, development of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections, further complications related to the pseudocyst or pancreatic necrosis, and potential bleeding complications due to the use of heparin for the pulmonary embolism."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing fever, with a maximum temperature of 102.2°F, and has not been able to tolerate extubation during spontaneous breathing trials. His respiratory status remains unstable, with an RSBI (respiratory system compliance/peak inspiratory pressure) of 34, indicating a restrictive lung disease pattern. The patient's pleural effusions have been cultured, with negative results. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes. The patient has also been found to have pulmonary embolism and pleural effusions on imaging studies. His abdomen is soft on examination, and he has evidence of pancreatic necrosis and a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulation therapy. He is also being monitored for acute kidney injury, alcohol withdrawal, and fracture healing. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to tolerate extubation during spontaneous breathing trials indicates ongoing respiratory failure. The restrictive lung disease pattern suggests the possibility of conditions such as pleural effusion or diaphragmatic elevation due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yom with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain (L foot,
   abdomen), and obesity.  No current evidence for acute pneumonia.
   Remains hypoxemic, requiring high FiO2 --> hope to work towards 40%
   prior to extubation trial.   Maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor
   ABG, monitor RR, monitor SaO2.  F/U CXR.  Daily wake up, monitor RSBI.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- clinical improvement, labs improved, but with
   radiographic evidence for pseudocyst.  Consider repeat imaging.
   Continue supportive care.  General Surgery to evaluate.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- likely responsible for fevers and respiratory
   failure.  Continue iv heparin
   FEVERS -- persistent.  Attributed to panreatitis (necrosis),
   pancreatitic pseudocyst, bacteremia (strept), UTI (Klebsiella), and now
   evidence for pulmonary embolism.  Monitor.  Currently on Meropenem
   alone.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- increase free water.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K >4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- would initiate enteral feedings via post-pyloric
   tube.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Plan net negative balance
   over net 24 hrs, if tolerates.
   LEFT FOOT TRAUMA -- Fracture by radiographs.  Orthopedic consult
   recommended boot in place.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Remains on benzodiazepines.  Beyond window for
   DTs.

Summary:
- The patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure.
- The respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain, and obesity.
- The patient remains hypoxemic and requires high FiO2 to maintain oxygenation.
- There is evidence of acute pancreatitis with clinical improvement, but with radiographic evidence for pseudocyst.
- The patient likely has a pulmonary embolism, which is responsible for fevers and respiratory failure.
- The patient has persistent fevers attributed to various causes, including pancreatitis, pseudocyst, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and now evidence for pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has hypernatremia and hypoalbuminemia, which require management.
- The patient is at risk for nutritional support and fluid balance issues.
- The patient has a left foot fracture due to trauma, and an orthopedic consult is recommended.
- The patient has chronic EtOH abuse and remains on benzodiazepines.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic ethanol abuse, being treated for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. There is a need to monitor ABG (arterial blood gas), RR (respiratory rate), and SaO2 (oxygen saturation). The FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) should be gradually decreased before attempting extubation.

2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has shown clinical improvement, but there is radiographic evidence of a pseudocyst. Supportive care should be continued, and general surgery evaluation is recommended.

3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is likely experiencing a pulmonary embolism, which could be responsible for the fevers and respiratory failure. Heparin should be continued as an IV infusion.

4. Fever: The patient's persistent fevers are attributed to various causes including necrotic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, bacteremia (Streptococcus), urinary tract infection (Klebsiella), and pulmonary embolism. Monitoring and appropriate antibiotic treatment are necessary.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, and increasing free water is recommended to correct this condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yom with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain (L foot,
   abdomen), and obesity.  No current evidence for acute pneumonia.
   Remains hypoxemic, requiring high FiO2 --> hope to work towards 40%
   prior to extubation trial.   Maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor
   ABG, monitor RR, monitor SaO2.  F/U CXR.  Daily wake up, monitor RSBI.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- clinical improvement, labs improved, but with
   radiographic evidence for pseudocyst.  Consider repeat imaging.
   Continue supportive care.  General Surgery to evaluate.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- likely responsible for fevers and respiratory
   failure.  Continue iv heparin
   FEVERS -- persistent.  Attributed to panreatitis (necrosis),
   pancreatitic pseudocyst, bacteremia (strept), UTI (Klebsiella), and now
   evidence for pulmonary embolism.  Monitor.  Currently on Meropenem
   alone.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- increase free water.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K >4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- would initiate enteral feedings via post-pyloric
   tube.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Plan net negative balance
   over net 24 hrs, if tolerates.
   LEFT FOOT TRAUMA -- Fracture by radiographs.  Orthopedic consult
   recommended boot in place.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Remains on benzodiazepines.  Beyond window for
   DTs.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse who was admitted with acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains hypoxemic and requires high FiO2 to maintain oxygenation. The cause of respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain, and obesity. 

2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has clinical improvement and improved labs, but with radiographic evidence for pseudocyst. This indicates a complication of pancreatitis, which is the formation of a pseudocyst.

3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient likely has a pulmonary embolism, which is responsible for fevers and respiratory failure. The treatment plan includes continuing with iv heparin.

4. FEVERS: The patient has persistent fevers attributed to various causes such as pancreatic necrosis, pancreatitis pseudocyst, bacteremia (strept), UTI (Klebsiella), and now evidence for pulmonary embolism. Monitoring is recommended.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, and the plan is to increase free water.

6. Hypokalemia: The patient has hypokalemia, and repletion to K >4.0 is advised.

7. Nutritional Support: Enteral feedings via post-pyloric tube are planned to initiate nutritional support.

8. Fluids: The patient's fluid balance is desired to be net negative over the next 24 hours if tolerated.

9. Left Foot Trauma: The patient has a fracture in the left foot, and an orthopedic consult is recommended.

10. EtOH Abuse: The patient has chronic alcohol abuse and remains on benzodiazepines. The window for delirium tremens has passed.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided progress note."

   48 yo M with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # respiratory failure - Barriers to extubation are likely sedation, PE,
   effusions, and restrictive physiology (elevated diaphragm, pseudocyst).
   - RSBI low, failed SBT (desats to 80s after ~1 hr) likely [**2-15**] sedation
   - Daily SBT
   - continue Heparin for PE, D1 = [**4-26**]
   - start to wean methadone and reassess pain requirements, sedation
   - per pharmacy, could consider ketamine gtt for pain relief without
   causing sedation if pain relief is intractable without significant
   sedation
   .
   # fevers - Thought to be [**2-15**] pancreatic necrosis vs. drug fever.
   Exhaustive w/u at OSH (BCx, UCx, [**Female First Name (un) **], LP, pseudocyst drainage) was
   negative for infection.  ?infected pseudocyst that has yet to be
   drained. Other noninfectious possibilities: malignancy (h/o renal mass,
   though not commented on on abdominal CT scan), drug fever, inflammatory
   condition.
   - d/ced IV meropenem
   - Resend cultures (blood, urine)
   - Send stool for C.diff
   - f/u Surgery recs
   - hold psych meds including seroquel, haldol, lexapro --> consider
   haldol if sedation is an issue
   .
   # acute pancreatitis: Lipase now 16. Abdomen is soft on exam.  As seen
   on CT torso, large pseudocyst compressing stomach + evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis.
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] recs
   - continue tube feeds if tolerated without significant residuals
   - monitor hct for hemorrhagic conversion
   .
   # PE
 as seen on CT torso.  Patient
s oxygenation remains stable on
   minimal PEEP on vent.
   - started heparin gtt on [**4-26**]
   .
   # Chronic alcohol abuse: Hospitalized for >2 weeks, outside of the
   window for withdrawal
   - On Midazolam drip; wean sedation as part of weaning off vent
   - As we wean versed, consider adding librium as patient known to
   withdraw and on benzo's for 2+ weeks
   .
   # s/p L metatarsal fx
 Continue fracture boot.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.6°F, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 141/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: tidal volume set at 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O, respiratory system compliance of 61.1 cmH2O/mL, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

The patient has a history of chronic alcohol abuse and is being treated for acute pancreatitis with evidence of pancreatic necrosis and a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach. The patient also has pulmonary embolism (PE), for which heparin has been started.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, persistent fevers, and acute pancreatitis. The barriers to extubation mentioned include sedation, pulmonary effusions, and restrictive physiology."

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo M with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # respiratory failure - Barriers to extubation are likely sedation, PE,
   effusions, and restrictive physiology (elevated diaphragm, pseudocyst).
   - RSBI low, failed SBT (desats to 80s after ~1 hr) likely [**2-15**] sedation
   - Daily SBT
   - continue Heparin for PE, D1 = [**4-26**]
   - start to wean methadone and reassess pain requirements, sedation
   - per pharmacy, could consider ketamine gtt for pain relief without
   causing sedation if pain relief is intractable without significant
   sedation
   .
   # fevers - Thought to be [**2-15**] pancreatic necrosis vs. drug fever.
   Exhaustive w/u at OSH (BCx, UCx, [**Female First Name (un) **], LP, pseudocyst drainage) was
   negative for infection.  ?infected pseudocyst that has yet to be
   drained. Other noninfectious possibilities: malignancy (h/o renal mass,
   though not commented on on abdominal CT scan), drug fever, inflammatory
   condition.
   - d/ced IV meropenem
   - Resend cultures (blood, urine)
   - Send stool for C.diff
   - f/u Surgery recs
   - hold psych meds including seroquel, haldol, lexapro --> consider
   haldol if sedation is an issue
   .
   # acute pancreatitis: Lipase now 16. Abdomen is soft on exam.  As seen
   on CT torso, large pseudocyst compressing stomach + evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis.
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] recs
   - continue tube feeds if tolerated without significant residuals
   - monitor hct for hemorrhagic conversion

   # PE
 as seen on CT torso.  Patient

   # Chronic alcohol abuse: Hospitalized for >2 weeks, outside of the
   window for withdrawal
   - On Midazolam drip; wean sedation as part of weaning off vent
   - As we wean versed, consider adding librium as patient known to

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   I examined the patient and was present for the key portion of the
   services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 12690**]
s note above and agree
   with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 12575**] has pancreatitis,
   pancreatic pseudocysts, small pulmonary emboli, significant abdominal
   pain, persistent fevers, ongoing resp failure, and large left pleural
   effusion, likely from his pancreatitis.  His resp failure is most
   likely from the combination of a large tense abdomen, pleural effusion,
   fevers, and sedation for pain.  Today he seems more comfortable on
   methadone and I would propose a gradual lowering of its dose. I would
   also change him from CMV to PSV to see if we can gradually get him to
   take over more ventilatory work.  I agree fevers are possibly drug
   induced as his WBC is only 7600, and I concur with holding Meropenem.
   His necrotizing pancreatitis could also cause fever, but I would have
   expected more signs of inflammation (leukocytosis, acidosis, etc).  45
   min spent in the care of this critically ill patient.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory failure due to various barriers such as sedation, pleural effusion, and restrictive physiology. His fever is thought to be caused by pancreatic necrosis or drug fever, although an extensive workup has been negative for infection. The patient also has evidence of pulmonary embolism and large pleural effusion likely secondary to pancreatitis. 

Plan of Care:
1. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) to assess readiness for extubation.
2. Continue heparin therapy for pulmonary embolism.
3. Wean off methadone and reassess pain requirements and sedation levels.
4. Consider ketamine infusion for pain relief without causing sedation if pain relief is intractable.
5. Hold psychotropic medications and consider haloperidol if sedation is an issue.
6. Continue tube feeds if tolerated without significant residuals.
7. Monitor hemoglobin levels for hemorrhagic conversion.
8. Consult with a surgeon regarding options for pseudocyst drainage.
9. Review abdominal CT scan for any signs of malignancy.
10. Resend blood and urine cultures.
11. Send stool for Clostridium difficile testing.
12. Follow up with orthopedic"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse who was admitted with acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The barrier to weaning off the vent is unclear but may be related to pleural effusions, elevated diaphragm, or a pseudocyst. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) are planned, and the patient may be extubated to bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPap) when ready.

2. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, likely due to pancreatic necrosis. Despite an extensive workup at the previous hospital, the cause of the fever remains unclear. Cultures are being monitored, and the possibility of an infected pseudocyst that has yet to be drained is considered.

3. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels, indicating ongoing inflammation. A CT scan revealed a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach and evidence of pancreatic necrosis. Monitoring for hemorrhagic conversion is important.

4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has evidence of PE on CT torso. Heparin therapy has been initiated, and oxygenation remains stable on minimal PEEP on vent.

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.6°F, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/86 to 188/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal limits. Kidney function appears to be normal based on creatinine levels, while liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there is evidence of hypernatremia.

The patient's imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusions, a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach, and evidence of pancreatic necrosis. The patient also has pulmonary embolism, as seen on CT torso.

The patient's medical history includes chronic alcohol abuse, a recent lower extremity fracture, and multiple psychiatric medications.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infectious complications: The patient's persistent fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. The cultures obtained from blood and urine will help identify the causative agent.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 129/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 154 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 0.9 mmol/L, and slightly low platelet count of 526 K/uL. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's abdomen is described as soft on examination, and imaging reveals a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach with evidence of pancreatic necrosis. The patient has been started on heparin for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), which was seen on CT torso. The patient's oxygenation remains stable on minimal PEEP on vent.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 129/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's weight has decreased from 147.3 kg at admission to 152.4 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, total CO2, glucose, and liver function tests are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include several potential complications. These include respiratory failure, fevers, acute pancreatitis, and pulmonary embolism (PE).

For respiratory failure, the patient is likely to have barriers to extubation, including sedation, PE effusions, and restrictive physiology. The patient's RSBI is low, and he failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) likely due to sedation. Daily SBTs are recommended, along with continuing heparin for PE prophylaxis.

The patient's fevers are thought to be caused by pancreatic necrosis or drug fever. An extensive workup at OSH"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined Mr [**Known lastname 12575**] and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the note by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 9683**] and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 12575**] has now been
   intubated for 3 weeks, and unless substantial progress toward
   extubation can be made this next week, he should be considered for a
   trache. Right now his obstacles to weaning are his sedation and
   occasional agitation, a lg left pleural effusion, his abdominal
   distention, and his fevers.  His abdominal exam seems benign enough to
   decrease both Versed and Methadone. We will consider using prn Haldol
   for agitation.  His ABGs today show hypercarbia (PC02 of 60) even on
   vent, and decreasing sedation should help this also.  If, once more
   awake he still fails RSBI and SBT
s an effort should be made to tap off
   his left effusion, which is no doubt from his pancreatitis.  He
   continues on heparin for his PE, though is needing quite high doses.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse who was admitted with acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. He has been intubated for 3 weeks and is currently on mechanical ventilation with minimal PEEP. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, fevers, acute pancreatitis, and pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to barriers to extubation such as sedation, PE effusions, and restrictive physiology. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) will be performed to assess readiness for extubation.

Fever: The patient's fever is thought to be caused by pancreatic necrosis or drug fever. Further investigations have been done but were negative for infection. It is still unclear whether the fever is due to an infected pseudocyst that has not been drained yet or another non-infectious cause.

Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis with evidence of pancreatic necrosis and a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach. Tube feeds will be continued if tolerated without significant residuals.

PE: The patient has evidence of PE on CT torso. Heparin therapy has been initiated.

Chronic Alcohol Abuse: The patient is also being managed for chronic alcohol abuse. Sedation will be weaned as part of weaning off the ventilator.

Surgical Recommendations: The patient needs follow-up with surgery for pseudocyst drainage and fracture boot follow"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, who was admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's fever is thought to be caused by either pancreatic necrosis or drug fever. The patient also has evidence of a pulmonary embolism (PE) on CT torso. The patient's current medications include midazolam, methadone, and haloperidol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern. The barriers to extubation include sedation, pulmonary effusions, and restrictive physiology (elevated diaphragm, pseudocyst). Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) should be performed to assess readiness for extubation.

2. Fever: The patient's persistent fevers may indicate an ongoing infection, such as infected pancreatic necrosis or drug fever. Cultures should be continued, and further evaluation for infection should be pursued.

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has evidence of a PE on CT torso. The patient's oxygenation remains stable on minimal PEEP on vent. Heparin therapy has been initiated, and the possibility of thoracentesis for pleural effusion should be assessed.

4. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis with evidence of pancreatic necrosis and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), blood pressure of 151/86 mmHg, heart rate of 79 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, which may be due to pancreatic necrosis, drug fever, or an infectious process. The patient's abdominal CT scan revealed evidence of pancreatic necrosis and a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach. Lipase levels have decreased from previous values.

The patient was started on heparin for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), but there has been no improvement in oxygenation since starting the medication. The patient's PE status is confirmed by CT findings.

The patient is also being treated for acute pancreatitis, chronic alcohol abuse, and a left metatarsal fracture. The patient's sedation will be weaned as part of the weaning off the ventilator. Methadone will be tapered, and Versed will be discontinued. Haloperidol (Haldol) will be used for agitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo M with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # respiratory failure - Barriers to extubation are likely sedation, PE,
   effusions, and restrictive physiology (elevated diaphragm, pseudocyst).
   - start to wean methadone and use versed bolus
   - RSBI low, failed SBT, has apnic episodes
   - Daily SBT
   - continue Heparin for PE, D1 = [**4-26**]
   - per pharmacy, could consider ketamine gtt for pain relief without
   causing sedation if pain relief is intractable without significant
   sedation
   .
   # fevers - Thought to be [**2-15**] pancreatic necrosis vs. drug fever.
   Exhaustive w/u at OSH (BCx, UCx, [**Female First Name (un) **], LP, pseudocyst drainage) was
   negative for infection.  ?infected pseudocyst that has yet to be
   drained. Other noninfectious possibilities: malignancy (h/o renal mass,
   though not commented on on abdominal CT scan), drug fever, inflammatory
   condition.
   - d/ced IV meropenem
   - Resend cultures (blood, urine)
   - Send stool for C.diff
   - f/u Surgery recs
   - hold psych meds including seroquel, haldol, lexapro --> consider
   haldol if sedation is an issue
   .
   # acute pancreatitis: Lipase now 16. Abdomen is soft on exam.  As seen
   on CT torso, large pseudocyst compressing stomach + evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis.
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] recs
   - continue tube feeds if tolerated without significant residuals
   - monitor hct for hemorrhagic conversion
   .
   # PE
 as seen on CT torso.  Patient
s oxygenation remains stable on
   minimal PEEP on vent.
   - started heparin gtt on [**4-26**]
   .
   # Chronic alcohol abuse: Hospitalized for >2 weeks, outside of the
   window for withdrawal
   - On Midazolam drip; wean sedation as part of weaning off vent
   - As we wean versed, consider adding librium as patient known to
   withdraw and on benzo's for 2+ weeks
   .
   # s/p L metatarsal fx
 Continue fracture boot.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic ethanol abuse who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fever with a maximum temperature of 102.6°F (39.2°C), and his current temperature is 101.6°F (38.7°C). His heart rate is within normal range (79 bpm), but his blood pressure is slightly elevated (151/86 mmHg). The patient's respiratory rate is controlled mechanically at 18 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97% on endotracheal tube ventilation with FiO2 of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 60 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 92.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular issues, as pulses in both upper and lower extremities are not assessed. Neurologic examination is also not performed. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (349 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (8.2 g/dL), elevated blood glucose levels (118-128 mg/dL), and abnormal liver function tests with elevated AST/ALT levels. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with creatinine levels ranging from 0.5-1.0 mg/dL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. The key findings and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient appears to have stabilized from acute pancreatitis. However, there is a risk of complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, or infected pancreatic necrosis.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and barotrauma.

3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is on therapeutic anticoagulation with IV heparin. Complications related to anticoagulation therapy include bleeding, such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Pain Control: The patient was previously on fentanyl and has been transitioned to methadone. Methadone is a long-acting opioid used for pain control. Complications related to opioid use include respiratory depression and sedation.

5. Fever: The patient has an unclear source of fever. Possible causes include infection, pancreatitis, or drug-related reactions. Complications may include sepsis or multiorgan dysfunction.

6. Agitation: The patient has been agitated and will be transitioned to regular haloperidol. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication used to manage agitation. Complications related to haloper"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yom with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain (L foot,
   abdomen), and obesity.  No current evidence for acute pneumonia.
   Remains hypoxemic, requiring high FiO2 --> hope to work towards 40%
   prior to extubation trial.   Maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor
   ABG, monitor RR, monitor SaO2.  F/U CXR.  Daily wake up, monitor RSBI.
   [**Month (only) 8**] be close to extubation trial, if fails
 tracheostomy.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- clinical improvement, labs improved, but with
   radiographic evidence for pseudocyst.  Plan repeat imaging today.
   Continue supportive care.  General Surgery following.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- likely responsible for fevers and respiratory
   failure.  Continue iv heparin
   FEVERS -- persistent.  Attributed to panreatitis (necrosis),
   pancreatitic pseudocyst, bacteremia (strept), UTI (Klebsiella), and
   pulmonary embolism.  Monitor.  Currently on no antimicrobials.
   SEDATION -- optimizing.  Limit medications, allow to wake more.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Resolved.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K >4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- would initiate enteral feedings via post-pyloric
   tube.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Plan net negative balance
   over net 24 hrs, if tolerates.
   LEFT FOOT TRAUMA -- Fracture by radiographs.  Orthopedic consult
   recommended boot in place.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Remains on benzodiazepines.  Beyond window for
   DTs.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic EtOH abuse, being treated for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypertension. His blood work indicates anemia, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia, which have since resolved. Imaging reveals evidence of a pseudocyst due to pancreatitis. The patient is also suspected to have a pulmonary embolism and left pleural effusion. He has a fracture in his left foot. The patient's sedation is being optimized, and nutritional support is planned through post-pyloric tube feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and includes pulmonary embolism, intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain, and obesity. Close monitoring of ABG, RR, and SaO2 is required. Daily wake-up tests and RSBI monitoring will be done to plan for extubation trials.

2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient's acute pancreatitis is improving clinically, but there is evidence of a pseudocyst on imaging. Repeat imaging is planned today, and general surgery will be involved in the management.

3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient likely has a pulmonary embolism, which is responsible for his"

   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- clinical improvement, labs improved, but with
   radiographic evidence for pseudocyst.  Consider repeat imaging.
   Continue supportive care.  General Surgery following.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- likely responsible for fevers and respiratory
   failure.  Continue iv heparin
   FEVERS -- persistent.  Attributed to panreatitis (necrosis),
   pancreatitic pseudocyst, bacteremia (strept), UTI (Klebsiella), and
   pulmonary embolism.  Monitor.  Currently on no antimicrobials.
   SEDATION -- optimizing.  Limit medications, allow to wake more.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Resolved.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K >4.0
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- would initiate enteral feedings via post-pyloric
   tube.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Plan net negative balance
   over net 24 hrs, if tolerates.
   LEFT FOOT TRAUMA -- Fracture by radiographs.  Orthopedic consult
   recommended boot in place.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Remains on benzodiazepines.  Beyond window for
   DTs.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain in the foot and abdomen, and obesity. There is no current evidence for acute pneumonia. The patient remains hypoxemic and requires high FiO2. The plan is to work towards 40% prior to extubation trial. The patient will be maintained on mechanical ventilation, and ABG, RR, and SaO2 will be monitored. A follow-up chest X-ray will be obtained, and daily wake-up will be performed to monitor RSBI. 

The patient also has acute pancreatitis, which has shown clinical improvement and lab improvement but with radiographic evidence for pseudocyst. Supportive care will continue, and general surgery will be consulted. 

Additionally, there is a likely pulmonary embolism responsible for the fevers and respiratory failure. The patient will continue on IV heparin. 

Fever persists and is attributed to pancreatitis (necrosis), pancreatic pseudocyst, bacteremia (Strept), UTI (Klebsiella), and pulmonary embolism. Monitoring will be continued, and the patient is currently on no antimicrobials. 

Optimization of sedation is ongoing, aiming to limit medications and allow"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently extubated but was previously on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. This indicates a critical respiratory condition that could lead to further complications if not managed properly.

2. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection. Possible sources include infected pseudocyst, drug fever, malignancy, or an inflammatory condition. This requires careful evaluation and management to prevent the progression of infection or other complications.

3. Acute pancreatitis: The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, with evidence of pancreatic necrosis and a large pseudocyst seen on the CT scan. This condition carries a risk of complications such as pancreatic pseudocyst rupture, abscess formation, or systemic spread of infection.

4. PE (Pulmonary embolism): The patient has evidence of PE on the CT torso. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin has been initiated, but platelets are trending down. Monitoring of coagulation parameters and adjusting anticoagulation therapy will be important to prevent further thrombotic events.

5. Hypertension: The patient has poorly controlled hypertension. Appropriate antihypertensive therapy should be continued to manage blood pressure levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.

6. Chronic alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of chronic alcohol abuse, which puts him at risk for withdrawal"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic EtOH abuse, admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several interventions, including invasive ventilation, extubation, restarting haloperidol, and initiating oxycodone for pain management. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/102 to 176/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is currently 152.4 kg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab results such as creatinine, TCO2, glucose, and electrolyte levels are within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal fluid collection around the pancreas, suggestive of a pseudocyst, as well as splenomegaly, enlargement of the small left pleural effusion, and bibasal airspace disease.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring for respiratory failure, fevers, and acute pancreatitis. The patient is being weaned off sedation and ventilatory support, with plans for daily spontaneous breathing trials. The patient's pleural effusion will be evaluated for possible thoracentesis, and there are ongoing efforts to identify the source of the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient had been intubated but was successfully extubated overnight and is tolerating it well. He has a recent CT scan showing fluid collection around the pancreas, likely representing a pseudocyst, as well as evidence of pancreatic necrosis. The patient also has splenomegaly and a small left pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Barriers to extubation include sedation, pulmonary embolism (PE), effusions, and restrictive physiology (elevated diaphragm, pseudocyst). Monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress or deterioration in oxygenation is important.
2. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, which could be due to various causes such as pancreatic necrosis, drug fever, or an infectious process. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the fever, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be considered if an infection is suspected.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a small left pleural effusion, which may require thoracentesis for diagnostic purposes and to alleviate symptoms. Monitoring for any increase in size or worsening respiratory status is important.
4. Pancreatic Necrosis: The patient's CT scan shows evidence of pancreatic necrosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yom with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain (L foot,
   abdomen), and obesity.   Currently tolerated extubation.   Maintain
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, monitor RR, monitor SaO2.  F/U
   CXR.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- clinical improvement, labs improved, but with
   radiographic evidence for pseudocyst.  Plan repeat imaging today.
   Continue supportive care.  General Surgery following.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- likely responsible for fevers and respiratory
   failure.  Continue iv heparin --> hope to
   FEVERS -- persistent.  Attributed to panreatitis (necrosis),
   pancreatitic pseudocyst, bacteremia (strept), UTI (Klebsiella), and
   pulmonary embolism.  Monitor.  Currently on no antimicrobials.
   SEDATION -- optimized.  Now off sedation.  Monitor for withdrawal.
   HYPERTENSION -- possibly related to aggitation, fevers, possible
   underlying psychiatric medications.  Continue to monitor.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K >4.0.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating enteral feedings via post-pyloric
   tube --> now d/c'd.  Discuss with Gen [**Doctor First Name **] if OK to begin clear
   liquids.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Plan net negative balance
   over net 24 hrs, if tolerates.
   LEFT FOOT TRAUMA -- Fracture by radiographs.  Orthopedic consult
   recommended boot in place.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Remains on benzodiazepines.  Beyond window for
   DTs.
   ACTIVITY -- PT consult.
   PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER -- hope to resume usual medications.  Consider
   Psychiatric consultation to assist.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic EtOH abuse being treated in the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and includes pulmonary embolism, intraabdominal inflammation, left pleural effusion, pain, and obesity. Currently, the patient is tolerating extubation and should maintain mechanical ventilation with monitoring of ABG, RR, and SaO2. A follow-up chest X-ray is planned.

The patient also has acute pancreatitis, which has shown clinical improvement and improved labs but with radiographic evidence of a pseudocyst. Supportive care will continue, and general surgery will be following up.

Additionally, the patient is suspected to have a pulmonary embolism, which is likely responsible for the fevers and respiratory failure. Intravenous heparin will be continued to prevent further clot formation.

The patient's fevers are persistent and attributed to various causes such as pancreatic necrosis, pancreatic pseudocyst, bacteremia (Streptococcus), urinary tract infection (Klebsiella), and pulmonary embolism. Monitoring will continue, and currently, the patient is not on any antimicrobials.

The patient's sedation has been optimized and is now off sedation. Withdrawal symptoms should be monitored for. The patient's hypertension may be related to agitation, fevers, and possible underlying psychiatric medications"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.8°C (100°F)
- Heart rate: 98 bpm
- Blood pressure: 197/106 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 93% on nasal cannula with FiO2 of 40%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient remains extubated and is tolerating enteral feedings via a post-pyloric tube. However, it is noted that the patient has a pseudocyst related to acute pancreatitis and is currently on systemic anticoagulation with heparin for suspected pulmonary embolism. 

The patient's laboratory values show mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Electrolyte imbalances are present, including hypokalemia.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains hypoxemic and requires high FiO2. The plan is to work towards a lower FiO2 prior to extubation trial. Mechanical ventilation will be maintained, and ABG, RR, and SaO2 will be monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. He underwent extubation this morning and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen. The patient has been on heparin drip since April 26th, and his platelets are trending down. He also has hypertension and is being treated with captopril and labetalol. The patient has a history of chronic alcohol abuse, and his withdrawal symptoms are being managed with midazolam and versed. He also has a left metatarsal fracture, for which he is wearing a fracture boot.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure and was intubated. Although he has been successfully extubated, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to his underlying acute pancreatitis and potential complications such as infected necrosis or pleural effusions.

2. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, which could indicate an ongoing infection, possibly pancreatic necrosis or an infected pseudocyst. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

3. Acute pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis with evidence of pancreatic necrosis and a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach. This condition can lead to complications such as pseudocyst rupture, infection, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. He was recently extubated and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen support. The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypertension, chronic alcohol abuse, and a history of renal mass. He also has a large pseudocyst compressing the stomach due to acute pancreatitis and evidence of pancreatic necrosis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he has shown fluctuations in blood pressure. His lab results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated levels of amylase and lipase. The patient's respiratory support has been reduced from mechanical ventilation to nasal cannula, and he is being weaned off sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers, which may indicate an ongoing infection. The possibility of infected pseudocyst or drug fever is being considered. Monitoring cultures and following up with surgical recommendations are essential to prevent or manage any potential infections.

2. Pancreatic Necrosis: The patient has evidence of pancreatic necrosis, which can lead to complications such as infected necrosis, abscess formation, or systemic infection. Close monitoring and appropriate surgical intervention may be necessary.

3. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient has been successfully extubated and is now on nasal cannula support, there is still a risk of respiratory failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated but is now extubated and on nasal cannula oxygen. He has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism and is on anticoagulation therapy. The patient has hypertension that is being managed with captopril and labetalol. He also has a history of chronic alcohol abuse and is currently on midazolam drip for sedation. The patient has a fracture in his left metatarsal and is wearing a fracture boot.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently being managed with medications, but it may require further intervention if not controlled.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clot formation and complications related to the pulmonary embolism.
3. Acute pancreatitis: The patient's condition may worsen if the pseudocyst becomes infected or if there are complications such as hemorrhagic conversion.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration.
5. Chronic alcohol abuse: Withdrawal symptoms may occur upon cessation of alcohol intake, and the patient is currently on benzodiazepines for sedation. Monitoring for withdrawal symptoms is essential.
6. Fracture: The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yom with chronic EtOH abuse who is being transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and
   respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Resolved.  Tolerated extubation.   Monitor RR,
   monitor SaO2.  F/U CXR.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- clinical improvement, labs improved, but with
   radiographic evidence for pseudocyst.  Continue supportive care.  Will
   require follow up with General Surgery in future.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- likely responsible for fevers and respiratory
   failure.  Continue iv heparin --> hope to transition to coumadin.
   FEVERS -- Resolved.   Attributed to panreatitis (necrosis),
   pancreatitic pseudocyst, bacteremia (strept), UTI (Klebsiella), and
   pulmonary embolism.  Monitor.  Currently on no antimicrobials.
   SEDATION -- optimized.  Now off sedation.  Monitor for withdrawal.
   HYPERTENSION -- possibly related to aggitation, fevers, possible
   underlying psychiatric medications.  Much improved with pharmacological
   agents.  Continue to monitor.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- replete to K >4.0.  Monitor values closely (repeat this
   AM labs).
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- Tolerating enteral feedings via post-pyloric
   tube --> now d/c'd.  Discuss with Gen [**Doctor First Name **] if OK to begin clear
   liquids.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Plan net negative balance
   over net 24 hrs, if tolerates.
   LEFT FOOT TRAUMA -- Fracture by radiographs.  Orthopedic consult
   recommended boot --> in place.
   EtOH ABUSE -- chronic.  Remains on benzodiazepines.  Beyond window for
   DTs.
   ACTIVITY -- PT consult.
   PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER -- Resume usual medications.  Consider Psychiatric
   consultation to assist.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic ethanol abuse who was admitted with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, persistent fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has shown some improvement, but there are several potential medical complications that could arise.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient previously experienced respiratory failure but has since resolved and tolerated extubation. However, close monitoring of the respiratory rate and oxygen saturation is still necessary.

2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient is showing clinical improvement in terms of lab values, but there is radiographic evidence of a pseudocyst. Supportive care will continue, and the patient will require follow-up with General Surgery in the future.

3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient likely had a pulmonary embolism, which could have caused the fevers and respiratory failure. The treatment plan includes continuing intravenous heparin and transitioning to coumadin.

4. FEVERS: The patient's fevers have resolved, but they were attributed to various causes including necrosis, pancreatitis pseudocyst, bacteremia (streptococcus), urinary tract infection (Klebsiella), and pulmonary embolism. Monitoring for any recurrence of fevers is important.

5. Sedation: The patient's sedation has been optimized and they are now off sedation. However, monitoring for withdrawal symptoms is necessary.

6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension has improved"
