","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent an aortic valve replacement (AVR), pulmonary artery flutter (PAF), hypertension (HTN), and presented with hematemesis. The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding from an esophageal mass, resulting in anemia and a drop in hematocrit (Hct) levels. The patient received 4 pRBCs, with the Hct bump from 22 to 28, and is currently receiving 2 xpRBCs. Pantoprazole (Protonix) has been initiated. A gastrointestinal (GI) scope is planned to evaluate the esophageal mass. The patient also has a distended abdomen, which was found during surgery. The hematocrit goal is set at 30. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K have been administered to correct the elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 3.0, while platelet levels are being maintained above 50,000/mm3. Cryoprecipitate has been given to increase fibrinogen levels above 100 mg/dL. There is concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hepatic failure, and the patient's condition will be monitored.

The patient has an esophageal mass with mediastinal lymphadenopathy (LAD), raising concerns for esophageal cancer versus lymphoma."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis post-aortic valve replacement, peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, and hematemesis. The patient presented with a new episode of hematemesis, which was managed with packed red blood cells (PRBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K, and pantoprazole. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped from 22 to 28 after receiving 4 units of PRBC, and is currently being transfused with 2 units of PRBC. Pantoprazole has been administered to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding. A repeat upper gastrointestinal (GI) scope is being considered due to the ongoing GI bleeding.

The patient also has an esophageal mass, which is concerning for esophageal cancer or lymphoma, given the elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. Additionally, the patient has signs of coagulopathy with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 3.0 and low fibrinogen levels, which could be indicative of hepatic failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's abdominal pain and distention suggest intraabdominal infection, and empirical treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) has been initiated. Pain management with dilaudid and suppositories or enemas for constipation have been provided.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a newly diagnosed stage IV adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. He is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding due to the cancer, which is being treated with radiation therapy (XRT). The patient also has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemolysis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to hypovolemic shock.
2. Development of further coagulopathy and increased risk of bleeding.
3. Acute kidney injury due to hypoperfusion or direct injury from cancer-related factors.
4. Infection due to immunosuppression from cancer and treatment.
5. Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to aspiration or compromised respiratory function.
6. Cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure due to anemia and decreased cardiac output.
7. Thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to hypercoagulable state.
8. Hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases or chemotherapy toxicity.

These are potential complications that may arise based on the patient's current condition and underlying medical conditions."

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/72 mmHg to 165/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.27.

Physical examination reveals blood in the patient's nose and oropharynx, a systolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border, diminished peripheral pulses on the right side more so than the left, and cool extremities bilaterally. The patient's abdominal examination shows tenderness in the epigastrium. Neurological examination is symmetric with intact cranial nerves and normal strength in upper and lower extremities.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Patient is a 63 yo M  with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage
   IV) with bleeding being treated with XRT, also with DIC and hemolysis.
   #. GI bleed:  Secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma.   It is unclear
   the rate of loss since he isn
t having much stool and his anemia is
   complicated by DIC.   He is getting XRT which may help stop bleeding.
   If so, we would expect to see an effect within days.  Because the
   bleeding vessels are small branches of the aorta, IR has said they
   would not be able to control bleeding by an embolization procedure.
   Thoracic surgery has said that surgery would not be an option for
   short-term control of bleeding.  Even if he were a candidate for
   chemotherapy, this would be unlikely to benefit him in terms of
   short-term bleeding.
   - continue PPI gtt
   - continue q4h Hct; transfuse to keep Hct >25
   - XRT #3 today and f/u rad onc recs
   - f/u with oncology
   - check Q4 Hct: transfuse for Hct<25
   - f/u GI recs: regarding benefit of endoscopy given bleeding
   - consult thoracic surgery re: possible role for control of bleeding
   - PPI gtt
   - needs central access vs peripheral IV
   #. DIC: Likely secondary to tumor.   The treatment will be systemic
   treatment of the tumor.  Lower suspicion for sepsis leading to DIC, but
   this is on the differential, and definitely a concern given fever last
   night.
   - q4h lab checks
   - replete with cryoprecipitate PRN fibrinogen <100
   - continue to discuss the possibility of chemotherapy with oncology, as
   below
   - f/u vascular studies of lower extremities for possibility of ischemia
   secondary to coagulation, although would not be able to therapeutically
   anticoagulate him even if this were the case.
   .
   #) Distended abdomen:  With large stool in the abdomen. This is most
   likely an ileus secondary to narcotics.  Barium study several days ago
   negative for colonic obstruction, although this would be a concern
   given known abdominal lymphadenopathy.  Currently another barium study
   would not be helpful until he clears current stool. Plenty of melanotic
   stool evacuated on rectal exam.
   - continue to monitor exam
   - continue reglan for motility
   - continue Zosyn which would empirically cover if gut is source of an
   infection (given fevers, as below)
   - repeat KUB
   - CT today if worsens.
   .
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following
   - continue to discuss with oncology whether chemotherapy might be an
   option
   - ongoing discussion with patient and his family regarding prognosis
   and goals of care
   .
   #) Fever:  100.8 at midnight.  Could be secondary to tumor vs
   infection.  Started Zosyn empirically yesterday given abdominal
   symptoms.   Cultures negative to date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic
   .
   #) Patient coping:  social work is involved, ongoing discussion with
   family
   - palliative care consult
   .
   #) Goals of care:  Family has expressed that patient would not want to
   know the gravity of his situation.  The team has communicated with them
   that this is not a feasible long-term option, especially if
   chemotherapy is a consideration.  Oncology is planning to have a
   discussion with him and his family today.

   Patient is a 63 yo M  with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage
   IV) with bleeding being treated with XRT, also with DIC and hemolysis.
   #. GI bleed:  Secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma.   It is unclear
   the rate of loss since he isn
t having much stool and his anemia is
   complicated by DIC.   He is getting XRT which may help stop bleeding.
   If so, we would expect to see an effect within days.  Because the
   bleeding vessels are small branches of the aorta, IR has said they
   would not be able to control bleeding by an embolization procedure.
   Thoracic surgery has said that surgery would not be an option for
   short-term control of bleeding.
   - continue PPI gtt
   - check Q4 Hct and free Ca/ K: transfuse for Hct<25
   - s/pXRT x3; f/u rad onc recs
   - f/u with GI and CT [**Doctor First Name 458**], although there is no immediate role for
   intervention, there may be if DIC improves with XRT/chemo
   - maintain 2 peripheral in addition to IJ
   #. DIC: Likely secondary to tumor; unlikely to be [**1-15**] sepsis as pt not
   exhibiting septic physiology, but this is still on the differential and
   he is being covered with zosyn.   The treatment will be systemic
   treatment of the tumor WITH chemo/ XRT.
    - q4h lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets and PT/PTT
   - replete platelets prn for plt<50
   - replete with cryoprecipitate PRN fibrinogen <100
   - replete with FFP if PT/PTT become elevated which has not been an
   issue yet
   - continue to discuss the possibility of chemotherapy with oncology, as
   below
   - f/u vascular studies of lower extremities for possibility of ischemia
   secondary to coagulation, although would not be able to therapeutically
   anticoagulate him even if this were the case.
   .
   #) Distended abdomen:  With large stool in the abdomen. This is most
   likely an ileus secondary to narcotics.  KUB showing contrast
   descending into the rectum and colonic dilation up to 8 cm.
   - continue to monitor exam, repeat KUB
   - continue reglan for motility
   - continue Zosyn which would empirically cover if gut is source of an
   infection (given fevers, as below)
   - repeat KUB
   - CT if worsens.
   .
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following
   - first dose of chemotherapy today, needs foley for this
   - ongoing discussion with patient and his family regarding prognosis
   and goals of care
   .
   #) Fever:   Could be secondary to tumor vs infection.  Started Zosyn
   empirically (d1=[**4-26**]) given abdominal symptoms.   Cultures negative to
   date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic
   .
   #) Patient coping:  social work is involved, ongoing discussion with
   family
   - palliative care consult
   .
   #) Goals of care:  Family had expressed that patient would not want to
   know the gravity of his situation.  This was discussed with pt today
   and he expressed that he would like to know all details including
   prognosis. He has been seen by palliative care, and remains full code.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low levels of oxygen in the blood, which may be due to respiratory issues or lung problems.

2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): This is a serious condition where the blood's clotting mechanisms become overactive, leading to the formation of small blood clots throughout the body. It can result in decreased blood flow to vital organs and can be life-threatening.

3. Hypernatremia (High Sodium): The patient has high levels of sodium in their blood, indicating a possible imbalance in fluid and electrolyte levels. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, weakness, and seizures.

4. Ineffective Coping: The patient is having difficulty adjusting to their current situation, which may be contributing to their overall condition.

5. Alteration in Tissue Perfusion: There may be impaired blood flow to certain tissues or organs, which can further complicate the patient's health.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an infection or inflammation in the body.

7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, possibly due to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This can lead to anemia and other complications.

8. Pain Control: The patient requires effective pain management due to acute and chronic pain related"

   Patient is a 63 yo M  with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage
   IV) with bleeding being treated with XRT, also with DIC and hemolysis.
   #. GI bleed:  Secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma.   It is unclear
   the rate of loss since he isn
t having much stool and his anemia is
   complicated by DIC.   He is getting XRT which may help stop bleeding.
   If so, we would expect to see an effect within days.  Because the
   bleeding vessels are small branches of the aorta, IR has said they
   would not be able to control bleeding by an embolization procedure.
   Thoracic surgery has said that surgery would not be an option for
   short-term control of bleeding.  Even if he were a candidate for
   chemotherapy, this would be unlikely to benefit him in terms of
   short-term bleeding.
   - continue PPI gtt
   - continue q4h Hct; transfuse to keep Hct >25
   - XRT #3 today and f/u rad onc recs
   - f/u with oncology
   - check Q4 Hct: transfuse for Hct<25
   - f/u GI recs: regarding benefit of endoscopy given bleeding
   - consult thoracic surgery re: possible role for control of bleeding
   - PPI gtt
   - needs central access vs peripheral IV
   #. DIC: Likely secondary to tumor.   The treatment will be systemic
   treatment of the tumor.  Lower suspicion for sepsis leading to DIC, but
   this is on the differential, and definitely a concern given fever last
   night.
   - q4h lab checks
   - replete with cryoprecipitate PRN fibrinogen <100
   - continue to discuss the possibility of chemotherapy with oncology, as
   below
   - f/u vascular studies of lower extremities for possibility of ischemia
   secondary to coagulation, although would not be able to therapeutically
   anticoagulate him even if this were the case.
   .
   #) Distended abdomen:  With large stool in the abdomen. This is most
   likely an ileus secondary to narcotics.  Barium study several days ago
   negative for colonic obstruction, although this would be a concern
   given known abdominal lymphadenopathy.  Currently another barium study
   would not be helpful until he clears current stool. Plenty of melanotic
   stool evacuated on rectal exam.
   - continue to monitor exam
   - continue reglan for motility
   - continue Zosyn which would empirically cover if gut is source of an
   infection (given fevers, as below)
   - repeat KUB
   - CT today if worsens.
   .
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following
   - continue to discuss with oncology whether chemotherapy might be an
   option
   - ongoing discussion with patient and his family regarding prognosis
   and goals of care
   .
   #) Fever:  100.8 at midnight.  Could be secondary to tumor vs
   infection.  Started Zosyn empirically yesterday given abdominal
   symptoms.   Cultures negative to date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic
   .
   #) Patient coping:  social work is involved, ongoing discussion with
   family
   - palliative care consult
   .
   #) Goals of care:  Family has expressed that patient would not want to
   know the gravity of his situation.  The team has communicated with them
   that this is not a feasible long-term option, especially if
   chemotherapy is a consideration.  Oncology is planning to have a
   discussion with him and his family today.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation level indicates a possible respiratory issue, which may require immediate attention.

2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's lab results show abnormalities in coagulation factors, indicating the presence of DIC. This condition requires prompt management to prevent further complications.

3. Hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient's elevated sodium levels suggest dehydration or imbalances in fluid and electrolyte balance. It is important to monitor and manage this condition to prevent neurological complications.

4. Ineffective coping: The patient's inability to cope with their illness may lead to psychological distress and poor overall well-being. Social work involvement and palliative care consultations can help address this issue.

5. Alteration in tissue perfusion: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest compromised blood flow to tissues, which can result in organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain adequate perfusion.

6. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count indicates an inflammatory response or infection. Continued monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be required.

7. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's bleeding esophageal adenocarcinoma poses a risk of ongoing GI bleeding. Close monitoring and ongoing management are crucial to prevent further blood loss.

8. Pain control: The patient's acute and chronic pain needs to be managed effectively to improve"

   Patient is a 63 yo M  with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage

   #. GI bleed:  Secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma.   Unclear the
   rate of GI loss since he has not had frank melena (only very dark brown
   guiaic + stools) and his anemia is complicated by DIC.   He is s/p XRT
   and currently undergoing chemo with oxalyplatin and 5FU which may help
   stop bleeding.  Overall, his requirement for red cells and cryo have
   decreased suggesting some progress.  Because the bleeding vessels are
   small branches of the aorta, IR has said they would not be able to
   control bleeding by an embolization procedure.  Thoracic surgery has
   said that surgery would not be an option for short-term control of
   bleeding.

   #. DIC: Likely secondary to tumor; unlikely to be [**1-15**] sepsis as pt not
   exhibiting septic physiology, but this is still on the differential and

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with newly diagnosed stage IV esophageal adenocarcinoma, experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and hemolysis. He has received external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and is currently undergoing chemotherapy with oxalyplatin and 5-fluorouracil. The patient's bleeding has slowed, and he has required transfusions of red blood cells and cryoprecipitate. His condition is complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was initially unresponsive to lopressor but controlled with diltiazem and then spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm. The patient also has an aortic valve replacement and has been experiencing fever, which could be due to tumor-related issues or infection. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically. The patient's abdomen was previously distended, likely due to ileus caused by narcotics, and he has had large bowel movements. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his blood tests show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and hypernatremia. The patient's goals of care have been discussed, and he wishes to be fully informed about his prognosis and remains full code. He is currently in the ICU receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has multiple lines inserted for treatment.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 91**] has needed 2 uPRBC's overnight. Chemotherapy has been
   started for treatment of underlying esophageal cancer. He has had
   problems with rapid afib and responded to IV diltiazem overnight and is
   back in NSR. PO diltiazem has been started.
   Exam notable for ecchymosis left UE with easy bruisability. He has dry
   MM and his belly is soft today after a large BM. Tm of 99.8, 112/63  HR
   80 RR  14 with sats of 98% on 3 lpm .  His abdomen is non tender but
   enlarged. His extremities are cool with features of stasis dermatitis.
   Better perfusion noted in legs
   Labs notable for WBC 12.8 K, HCT 28.4, plts of 92 ,K+ 4.0, Na of 147,
   Cr  0.8, BUN of 47 . CXR with clear lung fields, RIJ CVL.
   Agree with plan to support with blood products as needed during
   chemotherapy.  PICC access will be established to help with TPN.
   Overall prognosis is guarded but rests on his ability to respond to
   cheno/ XRT. We will check LENI
s for DVT given high risk with
   underlying malignancy and hypercoaguability.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma, likely stage IV, and is being treated with radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy. He has experienced significant bleeding, which has led to anemia and the need for blood transfusions. The bleeding is secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma, and efforts are being made to control it through chemotherapy and XRT. 

The patient also has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is likely secondary to the tumor. Treatment for DIC involves systemic treatment of the tumor with chemotherapy and XRT. 

Additionally, the patient has an ileus, likely secondary to narcotics, and is being managed with reglan for motility. He has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB-RVR), which was initially uncontrolled but has since converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously and has been maintained with oral diltiazem.

The patient is febrile, possibly due to tumor or infection, and is being treated empirically with Zosyn. Cultures have been negative to date.

The patient's goals of care include palliative treatment of the esophageal cancer and management of his current medical conditions. He is currently full code.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and prophylactic medications such as stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis"

   Patient is a 63 yo M  with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage
   IV) with bleeding being treated with XRT, also with DIC and hemolysis.
   #. GI bleed:  Secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma.   It is unclear
   the rate of loss since he isn
t having much stool and his anemia is
   complicated by DIC.   He is getting XRT which may help stop bleeding.
   If so, we would expect to see an effect within days.  Because the
   bleeding vessels are small branches of the aorta, IR has said they
   would not be able to control bleeding by an embolization procedure.
   Thoracic surgery has said that surgery would not be an option for
   short-term control of bleeding.
   - continue PPI gtt
   - check Q4 Hct and free Ca/ K: transfuse for Hct<25
   - s/pXRT x3; f/u rad onc recs
   - f/u with GI and CT [**Doctor First Name 458**], although there is no immediate role for
   intervention, there may be if DIC improves with XRT/chemo
   - maintain 2 peripheral in addition to IJ
   #. DIC: Likely secondary to tumor; unlikely to be [**1-15**] sepsis as pt not
   exhibiting septic physiology, but this is still on the differential and
   he is being covered with zosyn.   The treatment will be systemic
   treatment of the tumor WITH chemo/ XRT.
    - q4h lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets and PT/PTT
   - replete platelets prn for plt<50
   - replete with cryoprecipitate PRN fibrinogen <100
   - replete with FFP if PT/PTT become elevated which has not been an
   issue yet
   - continue to discuss the possibility of chemotherapy with oncology, as
   below
   - f/u vascular studies of lower extremities for possibility of ischemia
   secondary to coagulation, although would not be able to therapeutically
   anticoagulate him even if this were the case.
   .
   #) Distended abdomen:  With large stool in the abdomen. This is most
   likely an ileus secondary to narcotics.  KUB showing contrast
   descending into the rectum and colonic dilation up to 8 cm.
   - continue to monitor exam, repeat KUB
   - continue reglan for motility
   - continue Zosyn which would empirically cover if gut is source of an
   infection (given fevers, as below)
   - repeat KUB
   - CT if worsens.
   .
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following
   - first dose of chemotherapy today, needs foley for this
   - ongoing discussion with patient and his family regarding prognosis
   and goals of care
   .
   #) Fever:   Could be secondary to tumor vs infection.  Started Zosyn
   empirically (d1=[**4-26**]) given abdominal symptoms.   Cultures negative to
   date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic
   .
   #) Patient coping:  social work is involved, ongoing discussion with
   family
   - palliative care consult
   .
   #) Goals of care:  Family had expressed that patient would not want to
   know the gravity of his situation.  This was discussed with pt today
   and he expressed that he would like to know all details including
   prognosis. He has been seen by palliative care, and remains full code.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cancer, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is gastrointestinal bleeding, with a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. The patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was successfully controlled with diltiazem. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of platelets overnight. The patient's blood loss has slowed, and they did not require further cryoprecipitate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is 95% on a face tent, indicating potential hypoxemia.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's laboratory results show a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), indicating possible DIC.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 147 mEq/L, indicating hypernatremia.
4. Ineffective coping: The patient's inability to communicate or assess their pain suggests ineffective coping mechanisms.
5. Alteration in tissue perfusion: The patient's vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate, indicate possible alteration in tissue perfusion.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 16.9 K/uL,"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Patient is a 63 yo M  with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage
   IV) with bleeding being treated with XRT, also with DIC and hemolysis.
   #. GI bleed:  He has ongoing melena.  Bleed is secondary to esophageal
   adenocarcinoma.   Rate of bleed is unclear because his anemia is
   compounded by DIC.   He is s/p XRT and currently undergoing chemo with
   oxalyplatin and 5FU which may help stop bleeding.  Overall, his
   requirement for red cells and cryo have decreased suggesting some
   progress.  Because the bleeding vessels are small branches of the
   aorta, IR has said they would not be able to control bleeding by an
   embolization procedure.  Thoracic surgery has said that surgery would
   not be an option for short-term control of bleeding.  PPI gtt switched
   to [**Hospital1 **] IV yesterday given access issues.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - check Q4 Hct and free Ca/ K: transfuse for Hct<25
   - continue XRT (need to clarify course with rad-onc)
   - f/u with GI and CT [**Doctor First Name 458**], although there is no immediate role for
   intervention, there may be if DIC improves with XRT/chemo
   - maintain access as much as possible
   - discuss with oncology our end-point for bleeding and DIC and how that
   interplays with his long-term oncologic prognosis
   .
   #. DIC: Likely secondary to tumor; unlikely to be [**1-15**] sepsis as pt not
   exhibiting septic physiology, but this is still on the differential and
   he is being covered with zosyn.   The treatment is systemic treatment
   of the tumor with chemo/ XRT as above.
    - q4h lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets and PT/PTT
   - replete platelets prn for plt<50
   - replete with cryoprecipitate PRN fibrinogen <100
   - replete with FFP if PT/PTT become elevated which has not been an
   issue yet
   .
   #) Distended abdomen: Improved clinically, KUBs have been stable.
   Possibly is/was ileus secondary to narcotics?  Now having bowel
   movements.
   - continue reglan for motility
   - continue Zosyn which would empirically cover if gut is source of an
   infection:  plan to continue for 7 days total (2 more) given
   improvement on this medication
   - KUB +/- CT if worsens
   .
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following.  Getting XRT and now
   oxalyplatin/5FU chemotherapy.
   - continue 5-FU infusion
   - goal of current chemo and  XRT is to palliate bleeding
   - ongoing discussion with patient and his family regarding prognosis
   and goals of care
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: He continued to be hypernatremic because he has not
   been getting D5W as written secondary to access issues.
   - encourage PO free water
   - IV D5W if/when access available
   .
   #) Alkalemia:  On venous pH.  No evidence of volume depletion.  Unclear
   cause.
   - check ABG
   .
   #) AFIB-RVR: Had an episode with rate as high as 160 with down sloping
   ST depressions laterally on [**4-28**].   Controlled with diltiazem gtt
   followed by PO, reverted in to sinus rhythm and has remained in such
   since.  Not a candidate for anticoagulation given bleeding issues.
   - continue standing PO diliazem
   .
   #) Fever:   No fevers today. Could have been secondary to tumor vs
   infection.  Started Zosyn empirically (d1=[**4-26**]) given abdominal
   symptoms.   Cultures negative to date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic
   .
   #) Patient coping:  social work is involved, ongoing discussion with
   family
   - palliative care consulted and info given to pt, but they are not
   following daily
   .
   #) Goals of care:  He has been seen by palliative care, and remains
   full code.
   - discuss with oncology his prognosis and end-points
   ICU Care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage IV) who is experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. GI bleed: The patient has ongoing melena, which is indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding. This bleed is secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma. The rate of bleed is unclear due to the patient's anemia being compounded by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is undergoing chemotherapy with oxalyplatin and 5FU, which may help stop the bleeding. However, the bleeding vessels are small branches of the aorta, and interventional radiology (IR) has stated that they would not be able to control bleeding by embolization procedure. Thoracic surgery has also mentioned that surgery would not be an option for short-term control of bleeding.

2. DIC: The patient is likely experiencing DIC, which is secondary to the tumor. The treatment involves systemic treatment of the tumor with chemotherapy and radiation therapy (XRT) as mentioned above. The patient's lab results show low fibrinogen levels and prolonged PT/PTT, indicating DIC. The plan includes q4h lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets, and PT/PTT, repleting platelets and cryoprecipitate as needed, and repleting FFP if PT/PTT become elevated.

   Patient is a 63 yo M  with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage
   IV) with bleeding being treated with XRT, also with DIC and hemolysis.
   #. GI bleed:  Secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma.   Unclear the
   rate of GI loss since he has not had frank melena (only very dark brown
   guiaic + stools) and his anemia is complicated by DIC.   He is s/p XRT
   and currently undergoing chemo with oxalyplatin and 5FU which may help
   stop bleeding.  Overall, his requirement for red cells and cryo have
   decreased suggesting some progress.  Because the bleeding vessels are
   small branches of the aorta, IR has said they would not be able to
   control bleeding by an embolization procedure.  Thoracic surgery has
   said that surgery would not be an option for short-term control of
   bleeding.
   - continue PPI gtt
   - check Q4 Hct and free Ca/ K: transfuse for Hct<25
   - s/pXRT x3 and currently receiving chemotherapy; f/u ONC and  rad-onc
   recs
   - f/u with GI and CT [**Doctor First Name 458**], although there is no immediate role for
   intervention, there may be if DIC improves with XRT/chemo
   - maintain 2 peripheral in addition to IJ, attempt to obtain PICC
   #. DIC: Likely secondary to tumor; unlikely to be [**1-15**] sepsis as pt not
   exhibiting septic physiology, but this is still on the differential and
   he is being covered with zosyn.   The treatment is systemic treatment
   of the tumor WITH chemo/ XRT as above.
    - q4h lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets and PT/PTT
   - replete platelets prn for plt<50
   - replete with cryoprecipitate PRN fibrinogen <100
   - replete with FFP if PT/PTT become elevated which has not been an
   issue yet
   .
   #) Distended abdomen:  With large stool in the abdomen unchanged on
   repeat study, but pt finally had large BM last night and abdomen
   appears less distended. This was most likely an ileus secondary to
   narcotics, may not entirely be resolved.
    - f/u final read of KUB
   - continue reglan for motility
   - continue Zosyn which would empirically cover if gut is source of an
   infection (given fevers, as below)
   - CT if worsens.
   .
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following
   - goal of current chemo XRT is to palliate bleeding, d/w Onc re longer
   term plan
   - ongoing discussion with patient and his family regarding prognosis
   and goals of care
   .
   # AFIB-RVR: Unknown if pt has a hx, unclear precipitant. Clearly not a
   candidate for anticoag given other ongoing issues. Completely
   asymptomatic, vut did have rate as high as 160 with down sloping ST
   depressions laterally. Lopressor only transiently effective. Controlled
   with dilt idrip and then spontaneously converted back to sinus.
   - d/c dilt drip and substitute oral dilt to prevent further RVR
   .
   #) Fever:   Could be secondary to tumor vs infection.  Started Zosyn
   empirically (d1=[**4-26**]) given abdominal symptoms.   Cultures negative to
   date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic
   .
   #) Patient coping:  social work is involved, ongoing discussion with
   family
   - palliative care consulted and info given to pt, but they are not
   following daily
   .
   #) Goals of care:  Family had expressed that patient would not want to
   know the gravity of his situation.  This was discussed with pt and he
   expressed that he would like to know all details including prognosis.
   He has been seen by palliative care, and remains full code.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. GI bleed: The patient has ongoing bleeding secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This may continue and require further management with chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy.

2. DIC: The patient is experiencing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is likely secondary to the tumor. This condition can lead to abnormal blood clotting and bleeding.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient is hypernatremic, meaning their sodium levels are elevated. This may require careful monitoring and management to prevent complications.

4. Ineffective coping: The patient's family has expressed that they do not want the patient to know the gravity of his situation. However, the patient himself wants to be informed about his prognosis. This situation may lead to emotional distress for both the patient and the family.

5. Alteration in tissue perfusion: The patient has a history of distended abdomen, which may indicate decreased blood flow to the intestines. This can be a concern for potential ischemia or infarction.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which can be indicative of infection or inflammation.

7. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain related to his cancer diagnosis and treatment. Proper pain management is essential to improve his comfort.

8. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in the blood,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage IV) and is currently undergoing radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy. He has ongoing melena, which is secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma. The bleeding vessels are small branches of the aorta, and interventional radiology (IR) has stated that they would not be able to control the bleeding by embolization procedure. Thoracic surgery has also mentioned that surgery would not be an option for short-term control of bleeding. The patient requires 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) per day. His fibrinogen and INR levels are stable. He is also experiencing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is likely secondary to the tumor. The treatment for DIC includes systemic treatment of the tumor with chemotherapy and XRT. The patient's distended abdomen has improved clinically, and he is now having bowel movements. He is receiving gastric motility medications and antibiotics. The patient's sodium levels are elevated due to a lack of access for IV fluids. His arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 99%. He has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB-RVR) but has reverted to sinus rhythm. He does not require anticoagulation given the bleeding issues.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Patient is a 63 yo M  with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage
   IV) with bleeding being treated with XRT, also with DIC and hemolysis.
   #. GI bleed:  He has ongoing melena.  Continued Hct drop. Bleed is
   secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma.   Rate of bleed is unclear
   because his anemia is compounded by DIC.   He is s/p XRT and currently
   undergoing chemo with oxalyplatin and 5FU which may help stop
   bleeding.  Overall, his requirement for red cells and cryo have
   decreased suggesting some progress.  Because the bleeding vessels are
   small branches of the aorta, IR has said they would not be able to
   control bleeding by an embolization procedure.  Thoracic surgery has
   said that surgery would not be an option for short-term control of
   bleeding.  PPI gtt switched to [**Hospital1 **] IV yesterday given access issues.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - check Q4 Hct and free Ca/ K: transfuse for Hct<25
   - continue XRT (need to clarify course with rad-onc)
   - f/u with GI and CT [**Doctor First Name 458**], although there is no immediate role for
   intervention, there may be if DIC improves with XRT/chemo
   - maintain access as much as possible
   - discuss with oncology our end-point for bleeding and DIC and how that
   interplays with his long-term oncologic prognosis
   .
   #. DIC: Likely secondary to tumor; unlikely to be [**1-15**] sepsis as pt not
   exhibiting septic physiology, but this is still on the differential and
   he is being covered with zosyn.   The treatment is systemic treatment
   of the tumor with chemo/ XRT as above.
    - q4h lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets and PT/PTT
   - replete platelets prn for plt<50
   - replete with cryoprecipitate PRN fibrinogen <100
   - replete with FFP if PT/PTT become elevated which has not been an
   issue yet
   .
   #) Distended abdomen: Improved clinically, KUBs have been stable.
   Possibly is/was ileus secondary to narcotics?  Now having bowel
   movements.
   - continue reglan for motility
   - continue Zosyn which would empirically cover if gut is source of an
   infection:  plan to continue for 7 days total (2 more) given
   improvement on this medication
   - KUB +/- CT if worsens
   .
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following.  Getting XRT and now
   oxalyplatin/5FU chemotherapy.
   - continue 5-FU infusion
   - goal of current chemo and  XRT is to palliate bleeding
   - ongoing discussion with patient and his family regarding prognosis
   and goals of care
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: He continued to be hypernatremic because he has not
   been getting D5W as written secondary to access issues.
   - encourage PO free water
   - IV D5W if/when access available
   .
   #) Alkalemia:  On venous pH.  No evidence of volume depletion.  Unclear
   cause.
   - check ABG
   .
   #) AFIB-RVR: Had an episode with rate as high as 160 with down sloping
   ST depressions laterally on [**4-28**].   Controlled with diltiazem gtt
   followed by PO, reverted in to sinus rhythm and has remained in such
   since.  Not a candidate for anticoagulation given bleeding issues.
   - continue standing PO diliazem
   .
   #) Fever:   No fevers today. Could have been secondary to tumor vs
   infection.  Started Zosyn empirically (d1=[**4-26**]) given abdominal
   symptoms.   Cultures negative to date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic
   .
   #) Patient coping:  social work is involved, ongoing discussion with
   family
   - palliative care consulted and info given to pt, but they are not
   following daily
   .
   #) Goals of care:  He has been seen by palliative care, and remains
   full code.
   - discuss with oncology his prognosis and end-points

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage IV) and is undergoing radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy. The patient has ongoing melena and is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma. The bleeding is compounded by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's requirement for red cells and cryo has decreased, suggesting some progress. Surgical intervention for bleeding control has been ruled out. The patient continues to receive proton pump inhibitor (PPI) gtt switched to Hospital1 IV yesterday due to access issues. 

Other medical complications include hypernatremia, altered tissue perfusion, leukocytosis, and ineffective coping. The patient's abdominal distension has improved clinically, and bowel movements have resumed. He is also experiencing pain control issues. 

Further assessments and plans include monitoring for DIC with lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets, and PT/PTT. The patient will be repleted with platelets, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma as needed. He will continue to receive Zosyn empirically and have ongoing discussions with oncology regarding prognosis and goals of care. The patient's code status remains full code."

   - continue reglan for motility
   - continue Zosyn which would empirically cover if gut is source of an
   infection:  plan to continue for 7 days total (2 more) given
   improvement on this medication
   - KUB +/- CT if worsens
   .
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following.  Getting XRT and now
   oxalyplatin/5FU chemotherapy.
   - continue 5-FU infusion
   - goal of current chemo and  XRT is to palliate bleeding
   - ongoing discussion with patient and his family regarding prognosis
   and goals of care
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: He continued to be hypernatremic because he has not
   been getting D5W as written secondary to access issues.
   - encourage PO free water
   - IV D5W if/when access available
   .
   #) Alkalemia:  On venous pH.  No evidence of volume depletion.  Unclear
   cause.
   - check ABG
   .
   #) AFIB-RVR: Had an episode with rate as high as 160 with down sloping
   ST depressions laterally on [**4-28**].   Controlled with diltiazem gtt
   followed by PO, reverted in to sinus rhythm and has remained in such
   since.  Not a candidate for anticoagulation given bleeding issues.
   - continue standing PO diliazem
   .
   #) Fever:   No fevers today. Could have been secondary to tumor vs
   infection.  Started Zosyn empirically (d1=[**4-26**]) given abdominal
   symptoms.   Cultures negative to date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic
   .
   #) Patient coping:  social work is involved, ongoing discussion with
   family
   - palliative care consulted and info given to pt, but they are not
   following daily
   .
   #) Goals of care:  He has been seen by palliative care, and remains
   full code.
   - discuss with oncology his prognosis and end-points

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old male with a newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma, likely stage IV, and ongoing bleeding due to esophageal cancer.
- The patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemolysis.
- The bleeding is secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma, and efforts are being made to control it with radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy.
- The patient's requirement for red blood cells and cryoprecipitate has decreased, indicating some progress.
- Surgical options for controlling bleeding have been ruled out.
- The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to inadequate intake of free water.
- Other medical conditions include ineffective coping, alteration in tissue perfusion, leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleed, pain control, and altered mental status.
- The patient is currently receiving various treatments and interventions for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has ongoing melena due to esophageal adenocarcinoma. This condition can lead to significant blood loss and may result in hypotension, shock, and organ dysfunction.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has evidence of DIC, which is characterized by systemic activation of blood clotting, leading to the formation of blood clots throughout the body. This can lead to organ damage, impaired circulation, and increased risk of bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of midline shift. The patient has been receiving radiation therapy, and there is an impression of no evidence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show sinus tachycardia and a slightly elevated body temperature. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive intake of 4,236 mL and output of 3,775 mL, resulting in a balance of 461 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 99%. The patient's ABG results are pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) - The patient's lab results show elevated PT/INR and PTT, indicating a possible coagulation disorder.
2. Hypernatremia (high sodium) - The patient's sodium level is elevated at 148 mEq/L, indicating a potential electrolyte imbalance.
3. Leukocytosis - The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 12.8 K/uL, which could be indicative of an infection or inflammation.
4. Gastrointestinal bleed - Although not explicitly mentioned, the presence of an altered tissue perfusion and ineffective coping may suggest gastrointestinal bleeding as a potential complication.
5. Hypoxemia - Despite being on supplemental oxygen, the patient"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Patient is a 63 yo M  with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage
   IV) with bleeding being treated with XRT, also with DIC and hemolysis.
   #. GI bleed:  He has ongoing melena.  Continued Hct drop. Bleed is
   secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma.   Rate of bleed is unclear
   because his anemia is compounded by DIC.   He is s/p XRT and currently
   undergoing chemo with oxalyplatin and 5FU which may help stop
   bleeding.  Because the bleeding vessels are small branches of the
   aorta, IR has said they would not be able to control bleeding by an
   embolization procedure.  Thoracic surgery has said that surgery would
   not be an option for short-term control of bleeding.  PPI gtt switched
   to [**Hospital1 **] IV given access issues.  Overall, his requirement for red cells
   have been stable over the past few days, typically requiring 2Units of
   PRBCs per day without any requirements for cryo/FFP recently as
   fibrinogen/INR have been stable.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - check Q6 Hct and transfuse for Hct<25
   - continue XRT ; per radonc, course to proceed through the end of this
   week
   - f/u GI /CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs if any, although there is no immediate role for
   intervention
   - maintain access as much as possible
   - discuss with oncology our end-point for bleeding and DIC and how that
   interplays with his long-term oncologic prognosis
   .
   #. DIC: Likely secondary to tumor; unlikely to be [**1-15**] sepsis as pt not
   exhibiting septic physiology, but this is still on the differential and
   he is being covered with zosyn.   The treatment is systemic treatment
   of the tumor with chemo/ XRT as above
    - q6h lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets and PT/PTT; fibrinogen
   slowly rising, coags stable.
   - replete platelets prn for plt<50
   - replete with cryoprecipitate PRN fibrinogen <100, though patient has
   not required this recently
   - replete with FFP if PT/PTT become elevated which has not been an
   issue yet
   .
   #) Distended abdomen: Improved clinically, KUBs have been stable.
   Possibly is/was ileus secondary to narcotics?  Now having bowel
   movements.
   - continue reglan for motility
   - continue Zosyn which would empirically cover if gut is source of an
   infection:  plan to continue for 7 days total given improvement on this
   medication
   - KUB +/- CT if worsens
   .
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following.  Getting XRT and now
   oxalyplatin/5FU chemotherapy.
   - continue 5-FU infusion
   - goal of current chemo and  XRT is to palliate bleeding; XRT to
   continue through the end of the week per RadOnc
   - ongoing discussion with patient and his family regarding prognosis
   and goals of care
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: He continued to be hypernatremic because he had not
   been getting D5W as written secondary to access issues.
   - encourage PO free water
   - IV D5W to correct free water deficit as patient now has access for
   this
   .
   #) Alkalemia:  On venous pH.  No evidence of volume depletion.  Unclear
   cause.
   - check ABG
   .
   #) AFIB-RVR: Had an episode with rate as high as 160 with down sloping
   ST depressions laterally on [**4-28**].   Controlled with diltiazem gtt
   followed by PO, reverted in to sinus rhythm and has remained in such
   since.  Not a candidate for anticoagulation given bleeding issues.
   - continue standing PO diliazem
   .
   #) Fever:   No fevers today. Could have been secondary to tumor vs
   infection.  Started Zosyn empirically (d1=[**4-26**]) given abdominal
   symptoms.   Cultures negative to date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic
   .
   #) Patient coping:  social work is involved, ongoing discussion with
   family
   - palliative care consulted and info given to pt, but they are not
   following daily
   .
   #) FEN)
   -          Advanced diet to trial of clears yesterday
   .
   #) Goals of care:  He has been seen by palliative care, and remains
   full code.
   - discuss with oncology his prognosis and end-points

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a diagnosis of stage IV adenocarcinoma. He is experiencing ongoing melena, which is causing a drop in hemoglobin levels and resulting in anemia. The bleeding is secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma. The patient has been treated with radiation therapy (XRT) and is currently undergoing chemotherapy with oxalyplatin and 5FU, which may help stop the bleeding. Interventions such as embolization or surgery are not feasible options due to the location of the bleeding vessels.

The patient also has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), likely secondary to the tumor. Treatment for DIC involves systemic treatment of the tumor with chemotherapy and XRT. The patient's lab results indicate a rising fibrinogen level and stable coagulation parameters.

Other issues mentioned in the progress note include a distended abdomen, which has improved clinically, possibly due to narcotics causing ileus. The patient is now having bowel movements, and motility medications are being continued. Antibiotics are being administered empirically to cover potential gut infections.

The patient has esophageal cancer that is likely stage 4, based on mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Oncology is following the case, and the current goal of chemotherapy and XRT is to palliate bleeding. The patient's access for IV medications was an issue, resulting in a delay in receiving D5"

The patient is a 63-year-old male with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage IV) and ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding treated with radiation therapy (XRT). He also has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemolysis. The patient's requirement for red blood cells has been stable over the past few days, typically requiring 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) per day. His fibrinogen/INR levels have been stable, and he is undergoing chemotherapy with oxalyplatin and 5FU, which may help stop the bleeding. Surgery is not an option for short-term control of bleeding. The patient continues to receive proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and will have ongoing monitoring of hemoglobin concentration (Hct) with transfusion for Hct < 25.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Patient is a 63 yo M  with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage
   IV) with bleeding being treated with XRT, also with DIC and hemolysis.
   #. GI bleed:  He has ongoing melena.  Continued Hct drop. Bleed is
   secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma.   Rate of bleed is unclear
   because his anemia is compounded by DIC.   He is s/p XRT and currently
   undergoing chemo with oxalyplatin and 5FU which may help stop
   bleeding.  Because the bleeding vessels are small branches of the
   aorta, IR has said they would not be able to control bleeding by an
   embolization procedure.  Thoracic surgery has said that surgery would
   not be an option for short-term control of bleeding.  PPI gtt switched
   to [**Hospital1 **] IV given access issues.  Overall, his requirement for red cells
   have been stable over the past few days, typically requiring 2Units of
   PRBCs per day without any requirements for cryo/FFP recently as
   fibrinogen/INR have been stable.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - check Q6 Hct and transfuse for Hct<25
   - continue XRT ; per radonc, course to proceed through the end of this
   week
   - f/u GI /CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs if any, although there is no immediate role for
   intervention
   - maintain access as much as possible
   - discuss with oncology our end-point for bleeding and DIC and how that
   interplays with his long-term oncologic prognosis
   .
   #. DIC: Likely secondary to tumor; unlikely to be [**1-15**] sepsis as pt not
   exhibiting septic physiology, but this is still on the differential and
   he is being covered with zosyn.   The treatment is systemic treatment
   of the tumor with chemo/ XRT as above.
    - q6h lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets and PT/PTT; fibrinogen
   slowly rising, coags stable.
   - replete platelets prn for plt<50
   - replete with cryoprecipitate PRN fibrinogen <100, though patient has
   not required this recently
   - replete with FFP if PT/PTT become elevated which has not been an
   issue yet
   .
   #) Distended abdomen: Improved clinically, KUBs have been stable.
   Possibly is/was ileus secondary to narcotics?  Now having bowel
   movements.
   - continue reglan for motility
   - continue Zosyn which would empirically cover if gut is source of an
   infection:  plan to continue for 7 days total given improvement on this
   medication
   - KUB +/- CT if worsens
   .
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following.  Getting XRT and now
   oxalyplatin/5FU chemotherapy.
   - continue 5-FU infusion
   - goal of current chemo and  XRT is to palliate bleeding
   - ongoing discussion with patient and his family regarding prognosis
   and goals of care
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: He continued to be hypernatremic because he had not
   been getting D5W as written secondary to access issues.
   - encourage PO free water
   - IV D5W to correct free water deficit as patient now has access for
   this
   .
   #) Alkalemia:  On venous pH.  No evidence of volume depletion.  Unclear
   cause.
   - check ABG
   .
   #) AFIB-RVR: Had an episode with rate as high as 160 with down sloping
   ST depressions laterally on [**4-28**].   Controlled with diltiazem gtt
   followed by PO, reverted in to sinus rhythm and has remained in such
   since.  Not a candidate for anticoagulation given bleeding issues.
   - continue standing PO diliazem
   .
   #) Fever:   No fevers today. Could have been secondary to tumor vs
   infection.  Started Zosyn empirically (d1=[**4-26**]) given abdominal
   symptoms.   Cultures negative to date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic
   .
   #) Patient coping:  social work is involved, ongoing discussion with
   family
   - palliative care consulted and info given to pt, but they are not
   following daily
   .
   #) Goals of care:  He has been seen by palliative care, and remains
   full code.
   - discuss with oncology his prognosis and end-points

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma, likely stage IV. He has ongoing melena and a drop in hemoglobin concentration due to esophageal adenocarcinoma. The bleeding vessels are small branches of the aorta, making embolization or surgery not feasible for controlling the bleeding. The patient is currently undergoing radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy with oxalyplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) to palliate the bleeding. He requires regular red blood cell transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has ongoing melena and a drop in hemoglobin concentration, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. This can lead to hypovolemic shock and may require urgent intervention.
2. DIC: The patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is likely secondary to the tumor. DIC can lead to abnormal clotting and bleeding, increasing the risk of thrombotic events or excessive bleeding.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient is hypernatremic due to inadequate fluid administration. Hypernatremia can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, leading to symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Alkalemia: The patient has an elevated venous pH, which may be due to respiratory causes or metabolic disturbances. Alkalemia can lead to symptoms such as muscle weakness"

   .
   #. GI bleed:   Overall, his requirement for red cells have been stable
   over the past few days, typically requiring 2Units of PRBCs per day
   without any requirements for cryo/FFP recently as fibrinogen/INR have

   embolization procedure.  Thoracic surgery has said that surgery would
   not be an option for short-term control of bleeding.  PPI gtt switched
   to [**Hospital1 **] IV given access issues.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - check Q6 Hct and transfuse for Hct<25
   - continue XRT ; per radonc, course to proceed through the end of this
   week
   - f/u GI /CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs if any, although there is no immediate role for
   intervention
   - maintain access as much as possible
   .
   #. DIC: Seems to be improving, with fibrinogen now stably >200 without
   any cryoprecipitate.  He does have a platelet requirement, although
   this may be secondary to BM involvmenet of cancer in addition to the
   (now improving) DIC.   The DIC is likely secondary to tumor; unlikely
   to be [**1-15**] sepsis as all cx negative, now completed a 7-day course of
   Zosyn.  The treatment is systemic treatment of the tumor with chemo/
   XRT as above
    - q6h lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets and PT/PTT: fibrinogen
   slowly rising, coags stable.
   - replete platelets prn for plt<50
   - replete with cryoprecipitate PRN fibrinogen <100, though patient has
   not required this recently
   - replete with FFP if PT/PTT become elevated which has not been an
   issue yet
   .
   #) Distended abdomen: Improved.   Possibly is/was ileus secondary to
   narcotics?  Now having bowel movements.
   - continue reglan for motility
   - completed 7-day course of Zosyn today
   - KUB +/- CT if worsens
   .
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following.
   - continue XRT through to end of week
   - continue 5-FU infusion (s/p oxyplatinum), last day today
   .
   #) Fever:   Intermittent and low-grade.  Possibly secondary to tumor.
   No evidence of infection currently.  Started Zosyn empirically
   (d1=[**4-26**]) given abdominal symptoms, completing course today.   Cultures
   negative to date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AFIB-RVR: Had an episode with rate as high as 160 with down sloping
   ST depressions laterally on [**4-28**].   Controlled with diltiazem gtt
   followed by PO, reverted in to sinus rhythm and has remained in such
   since.  Not a candidate for anticoagulation given bleeding issues.
   - continue standing PO diliazem
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: improved
   - encourage PO free water
   .
   #) Alkalemia:  improved,  venous pH now normal.
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic

","The patient is a 63-year-old male with a newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma, likely stage IV, and is currently undergoing radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy with oxalyplatin and 5FU. The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma, which has resulted in anemia compounded by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. GI bleed: The patient's requirement for red blood cells (RBCs) has been stable over the past few days, typically requiring 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) per day. The bleeding is secondary to esophageal adenocarcinoma, and the rate of bleed is unclear. Surgery is not an option for short-term control of bleeding, and embolization procedure is also not feasible due to the small branches of the aorta involved. The patient will continue with XRT and chemotherapy, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy will be continued.

2. DIC: The patient's DIC seems to be improving, with fibrinogen levels now stably greater than 200 without any cryoprecipitate. The DIC is likely secondary to tumor involvement, and systemic treatment of the tumor with chemotherapy/XRT will be continued. The patient will be monitored with q6h lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets, and PT/PTT, and platelets will be repleted as needed for platelet count <50,000/mL. Cryoprecipitate will be given PRN for fibrinogen <100, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be given if PT/PTT become elevated.

3. Distended abdomen: The patient's distended abdomen has improved and may have been secondary to ileus due to narcotics. The patient is now having bowel movements, and motility will be supported with reglan.

4. Esophageal cancer: The patient has likely stage IV esophageal cancer based on mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Oncology is following the patient's case, and XRT will be continued through the end of the week. The patient will also continue with 5-FU infusion.

5. Fever: The patient has intermittent low-grade fever, possibly secondary to tumor. No evidence of infection is currently present, and cultures have been negative to date. The patient will be followed up with cultures and trend fever curve.

6. Atrial fibrillation-rhythm control: The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with a rate as high as 160 and down-sloping ST depressions laterally on April 28th. It was controlled with diltiazem gtt followed by oral medication, and the patient has remained in sinus rhythm since then. The patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation given bleeding issues, and standing PO diltiaz"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma, likely stage IV, being treated with XRT and experiencing bleeding. The patient also has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemolysis. The patient underwent an esophageal cancer staging procedure and has a history of aortic valve replacement. The patient's current medical issues include gastrointestinal bleeding, DIC, esophageal cancer, fever, and poor nutritional status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has experienced bleeding, which is being treated with XRT. The bleeding vessels are small branches of the aorta, and interventional radiology (IR) has determined that they will not be able to control the bleeding through embolization. The patient will continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and will have regular checks on hematocrit (Hct) levels, with transfusion if Hct is less than 25.

2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has stable coagulation factors and platelets. The DIC is likely secondary to the tumor and is unlikely to be due to sepsis since all cultures are negative. The treatment plan involves systemic treatment of the tumor with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient will have regular lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets, and PT/PTT, with fibrinogen slowly rising, coags stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 63 yo M  with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma (likely stage
   IV) with bleeding being treated with XRT, also with DIC and hemolysis.
   #. GI bleed:   The patient has not required transfusions for ~24 hours
   and has had stable hematocrit despite persistent maroon stools. He is
   on his penultimate day of XRT and s/p oxalyplatin/5FU. Because the
   bleeding vessels are small branches of the aorta, IR has said they
   would not be able to control bleeding by an embolization procedure.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   - check Q12 Hct and transfuse for Hct<25
   - continue XRT ; per Rad/Onc, course to proceed through the end of this
   week
   - maintain access as much as possible/T&S
   #. DIC: Resolved.  Patient does not have current laboratory evidence of
   DIC.  His Fibrinogen/Coags & platelets are stable.
   - Daily lab checks for fibrinogen, platelets and PT/PTT:
   - replete platelets prn for plt<50
   - replete with cryoprecipitate PRN fibrinogen <100, though patient has
   not required this recently
   - replete with FFP if PT/PTT become elevated which has not been an
   issue yet
   #)  Esophageal cancer:  likely stage 4 based on mediastinal and
   retroperitoneal LAD.  Oncology is following.  Chemotherapy complete.
   - continue XRT through to end of week
   #) Fever:   Intermittent and low-grade.  Possibly secondary to tumor.
   No evidence of infection currently.  Completed 7 day Zosyn empiric
   course. Cultures negative to date.
   - f//u cultures
   - trend fever curve
   .
   #) AVR: patient with aortic valve replacement, stable currently without
   anticoagulation as bioprosthetic
   .
   #) FEN: -  advance diet to regular today
   .
   #) Goals of care:  He has been seen by palliative care, and remains
   full code.
   - discuss with oncology his prognosis and end-points

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old male with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma, likely stage IV.
- He is being treated with external beam radiation therapy (XRT) and has experienced bleeding, which is being managed conservatively due to the small branches of the aorta involved.
- The patient has also had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemolysis, but these conditions have resolved.
- He has a history of esophageal cancer, likely stage IV, and has completed chemotherapy.
- The patient's vital signs are generally stable, with a heart rate between 80-109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94-176 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula.
- Physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, pale conjunctiva, systolic murmur, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm extremities, and intact neurologic function.
- Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, with improved fibrinogen levels.
- Imaging and microbiology results are pending.
- The patient's goals of care are to continue with XRT and discuss prognosis and end-points with oncology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has persistent maroon stools, indicating ongoing bleeding. Despite conservative management,"
