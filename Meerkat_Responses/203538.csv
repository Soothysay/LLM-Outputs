   Assessment and Plan
   Plan:
   #COPD exacerbation: Likely secondary to viral illness due to low
   temperature, no leukocytosis and duration of onset. Patient appears
   comfortable now on 4L NC. Gram stain shows OP organisms only.
   -F/U sputum culture
   -Continue albuterol nebs, home Advair diskus, Spiriva, and leukotriene
   inhibitor. No need for steroids.
   -Continue Levaquin and Ceftriaxone for now. Will D/C once cultures come
   back
   -Continue Lasix for diuresis
   #Anemia: Current HcT of 22.2 is not appropriate after 3 units of blood.
   Likely secondary to GI bleeding as stool was guiac positive and no
   other signs/symptoms of bleeding are evident.
   -Will give another unit. Goal of Hct > 30%
   -Monitor crit q 8 hours
   -Appreciate GI consult. They prefer to perform the EGD on Monday in the
   endoscopy suite under MAC anesthesia due to the patient
s body habitus.
   Will see her this morning to leave a full consult with recommendations.
   #Abdominal pain: Likely a peptic ulcer, as patient has had this in the
   past and would explain anemia.
   -Continue PPI
   -EGD as above.
   #CHF- Last echo in [**2193**]:
   IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved biventricular global and
   regional systolic function. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-1-14**], mild
   aortic stenosis is now more definitely shown. Pulmonary hypertension is
   no longer appreciated. The other findings appear similar.""
   -Lasix as above
   -Continue amlodipine and lisinopril.
   .
   #OSA: Likely Obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Would benefit from sleep
   study as an outpatient, but will titrate autoset CPAP during ICU stay.
   -OOB to chair as tolerated
   #Thrombocytopenia: Has been in the low 100's for years, but 90 today.
   Has not been on heparin products, or other drugs which induce
   thrombocytopenia. Unlikely to be HIT. Could be ITP, or related to

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. They have a history of COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OSA), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and peptic ulcer disease. The patient is currently receiving treatment for COPD exacerbation, anemia, and peptic ulcer disease. They are also being monitored for thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's shortness of breath and wheezing indicate a likely COPD exacerbation. If not properly managed, this could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Anemia: The patient's current hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL is below the normal range, indicating anemia. If not treated appropriately, severe anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 90 K/uL, indicating thrombocytopenia. This condition increases the risk of bleeding, especially if the patient undergoes procedures like an endoscopy.
4. Peptic Ulcer Disease: The patient's history of peptic ulcer disease and positive stool guaiac test suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. If left untreated, this can lead to significant blood loss and shock.
5. Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OSA"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with dyspnea and cough for three days. The patient's current health issues include gastrointestinal bleed (GI bleed), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, anemia, abdominal pain (likely due to peptic ulcer), congestive heart failure (CHF), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and thrombocytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Further GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed, which could lead to significant blood loss and potential shock if not managed appropriately.

2. Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's COPD exacerbation increases the risk of respiratory complications such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Anemia: The patient's anemia, likely secondary to the GI bleed, can worsen if not adequately treated. It may result in decreased oxygen carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.

4. Peptic ulcer complications: If the patient's abdominal pain is indeed due to a peptic ulcer, there is a risk of perforation or bleeding from the ulcer.

5. CHF exacerbation: The patient's CHF can worsen if not properly managed, leading to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 63 year-old female with a history of COPD who presents with
   dyspnea and cough x3 days, who responded to nebulizer treatments in the
   ED. Most likely diagnosis is a COPD exacerbation secondary to a viral
   illness, but pneumonia or CHF exacerbation are also in the
   differential.
   #COPD exacerbation: Likely secondary to viral illness due to low
   temperature, no leukocytosis and duration of onset. Patient appears
   comfortable now on 4L NC. Gram stain shows OP organisms only.
   -F/U sputum culture
   -Continue albuterol nebs, home Advair diskus, Ipratroprium, and
   leukotriene inhibitor. No need for steroids.
   -Continue Levaquin and Ceftriaxone for now. Will D/C once cultures come
   back
   -Continue Lasix for diuresis
   #Anemia: Current HcT of 22.2 is not appropriate after 3 units of blood.
   Likely secondary to GI bleeding as stool was guiac positive and no
   other signs/symptoms of bleeding are evident.
   -Will give another unit. Goal of Hct > 30%
   -Monitor crit q 8 hours
   -Appreciate GI consult. They prefer to perform the EGD on Monday in the
   endoscopy suite under MAC anesthesia due to the patient
s body habitus.
   Will see her this morning to leave a full consult with recommendations.
    #Abdominal pain: Likely a peptic ulcer, as patient has had this in the
   past and would explain anemia.
   -Continue PPI
   -EGD as above.
    #CHF: Patient has a lot of peripheral edema. Last echo in [**2193**]:
   IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved biventricular global and
   regional systolic function. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-1-14**], mild
   aortic stenosis is now more definitely shown. Pulmonary hypertension is
   no longer appreciated. The other findings appear similar.""
   -Lasix as above
   -Continue amlodipine and lisinopril.
    #OSA: Likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Patient did not
   tolerate CPAP overnight. Would benefit from sleep study as an
   outpatient
   - Will try cardiac chair for sleep, OOB
   -OOB to chair as tolerated
   #Thrombocytopenia: Has been in the low 100's for years, but 90 today.
   Has not been on heparin products, or other drugs which induce
   thrombocytopenia. Unlikely to be HIT. Could be ITP, or related to
   anemia of chronic disease.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presents with dyspnea and cough for three days. The likely diagnosis is a COPD exacerbation secondary to a viral illness. Other possible diagnoses include pneumonia or congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131/27 to 134/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with increased work of breathing. Physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention, regular heart rhythm, grade IV systolic ejection murmur, clear lungs with minimal expiratory wheezes, and warm extremities with 2+ pitting edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin concentration decreasing from 20.7 to 27.8%, platelet count ranging from 77 to 101 thousand/mm3, blood glucose levels between 120 and 94 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances such as low sodium (139 mEq/L) and potassium (3.9 mEq/L) levels.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has a history of COPD, anemia, abdominal pain, congestive heart failure (CHF), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OSA), and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently in the ICU due to a suspected COPD exacerbation, which is likely secondary to a viral illness. The patient is also experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by a positive guaiac test in their stool. There are concerns about the patient's thrombocytopenia, which has been present for years but is currently at a low level. The patient's OSA needs to be managed with CPAP titration during their ICU stay. Additionally, the patient has CHF, for which they are being treated with diuretics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged or severe COPD exacerbation: The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored to prevent worsening respiratory distress or the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia is likely due to GI bleeding. Continued monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further blood loss.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count should be monitored, and any potential causes such as ITP or anemia of chronic disease should be evaluated.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation: The patient's CHF needs to"

   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   This is a 63 year-old female with a history of COPD who presents with
   dyspnea and cough x3 days, who responded to nebulizer treatments in the
   ED. Most likely diagnosis is a COPD exacerbation secondary to a viral
   illness, but pneumonia or CHF exacerbation are also in the
   differential.
   #COPD exacerbation: Likely secondary to viral illness due to low
   temperature, no leukocytosis and duration of onset. Patient appears
   comfortable now on 4L NC. Gram stain shows OP organisms only.
   -F/U sputum culture
   -Continue albuterol nebs, home Advair diskus, Ipratroprium, and
   leukotriene inhibitor. No need for steroids.
   -Will narrow coverage down to Levaquin 7 day total course and d/c
   Ceftriaxone for now.
    -Continue Lasix for diuresis
   #Anemia: Current HcT of 22.2 is not appropriate after 3 units of blood.
   Likely secondary to GI bleeding as stool was guiac positive and no
   other signs/symptoms of bleeding are evident.
   -Will give another unit. Goal of Hct > 30%
   -Monitor crit q 8 hours
   -Appreciate GI consult. They prefer to perform the EGD on Monday in the
   endoscopy suite under MAC anesthesia due to the patient
s body habitus.
   Will see her this morning to leave a full consult with recommendations.
    #Abdominal pain: Likely a peptic ulcer, as patient has had this in the
   past and would explain anemia.
   -Continue PPI
   -EGD as above.
    #CHF: Patient has a lot of peripheral edema. Last echo in [**2193**]:
   IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved biventricular global and
   regional systolic function. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-1-14**], mild
   aortic stenosis is now more definitely shown. Pulmonary hypertension is
   no longer appreciated. The other findings appear similar.""
   -Lasix as above
   -Continue amlodipine and lisinopril.
    #OSA: Likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Patient did not
   tolerate CPAP overnight. Would benefit from sleep study as an
   outpatient
   - Will try cardiac chair for sleep, OOB
   -OOB to chair as tolerated
   -Will switch pt to BiPAP
   #Thrombocytopenia: Has been in the low 100's for years, but 90 today.
   Has not been on heparin products, or other drugs which induce
   thrombocytopenia. Unlikely to be HIT. Could be ITP, or related to

The most likely diagnosis is a COPD exacerbation secondary to a viral illness, but pneumonia or congestive heart failure exacerbation are also in the differential.

The patient responded to nebulizer treatments in the emergency department. Gram stain shows OP organisms only, so follow-up sputum culture is planned. The patient will continue on albuterol nebs, home Advair diskus, ipratropium, and leukotriene inhibitor. Coverage will be narrowed down to Levofloxacin for a total of seven days, and ceftriaxone will be discontinued for now. Lasix will be continued for diuresis.

The patient's current hematocrit (Hct) of 22.2 is not appropriate after receiving three units of blood. This is likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding as stool was guaiac positive, and no other signs or symptoms of bleeding are evident. Another unit of blood will be given, with a goal Hct > 30%. Critical monitoring will be done every eight hours.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with hisotry of COPD and found to have melena and blood
   loss anemia leading to ICU admission.  Her initial admission was in the
   setting of respiratory distress and felt to have both obstructive
   source of respiratory distress but also with concern raised for
   hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
   Her presentation is mixed
she has initial presentation with respiratory
   distress.  This was felt to be related to possible pneumonia based upon
   cough (white sputum and possible infiltrate on poor quality X-ray).
   There have been issues raised as to possible hydrostatic pulmlonary
   edema
this was in the setting of orthopnea and Aortic Stenosis (mild in
   past) and significant volume load with PRBC
s needed.  The argument for
   acute exacerbation with her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is
   based only upon transient dyspnea.  This leads likely transient
   pulmonary edema in the setting of volume load with PRBC
s given and now
   resolved with diuresis she likely has returned to a chronic baseline
   compromise with restrictive ventilatory defect.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of COPD who presented to the ICU with melena and blood loss anemia. She was initially admitted due to respiratory distress, which was initially thought to be caused by a mixed obstructive and hydrostatic pulmonary edema. However, it is now believed that the respiratory distress may be an acute exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient required 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight and received Lasix to manage volume overload. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/57 mmHg to 128/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support. Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 10500/uL, platelet count of 101000/uL, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient's condition is stable, and she is expected to continue receiving ICU care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presented with melena and blood loss anemia, indicating a potential gastrointestinal bleed. Close monitoring and further investigation are necessary to determine the source and severity of the bleed. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed, anemia secondary to blood loss, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed significant atrial fibrillation, which can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and an irregular heartbeat that may affect blood flow and oxygen delivery to the body.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which can be caused by pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or other respiratory conditions. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in respiratory failure.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has a gastrointestinal bleed, which can lead to hypovolemic shock if not managed promptly. There is a risk of re-bleeding and ongoing blood loss.
4. Anemia Secondary to Blood Loss: Due to the ongoing blood loss, the patient is at risk of developing anemia, which can impair oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
5. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) and Right Ventricular (RV) Compromise: The patient is showing signs of significant PAH and RV compromise, which can lead to heart failure and decreased cardiac output.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving oxygen support, increasing the risk of"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 year-old female with a history of COPD who presents with dyspnea and
   cough x3 days, who responded to nebulizer treatments in the ED. Most
   likely diagnosis is a COPD exacerbation secondary to a viral illness,
   but pneumonia or CHF exacerbation are also in the differential.
   Developed episode of a-fib, likely due to volume depletion, but there
   may be a component of decompensated CHF as well.
   #COPD exacerbation: Likely secondary to viral illness due to low
   temperature, no leukocytosis and duration of onset. Patient appears
   comfortable now and saturating 99% on 6L NC. Will also begin short
   course of steroids to augment home treatment. Gram stain and cultures
   show OP organisms only.
   -Continue albuterol nebs, home Advair diskus, Ipratroprium, and
   leukotriene inhibitor.
   -Final dose of Levaquin today (Day 5)
   -Lasix held after episode of a-fib, tachycardia, hypercarbia. Will
   re-start home dose of 40mg PO daily once heart rate and rhythm
   stabilize.
   -Prednisone 40mg PO daily x 5 days (last day [**3-5**]).
   #Atrial fibrillation: Likely secondary to volume depletion. Currently
   -5.75 L for LOS. Home Lasix dose was decreased to 20mg and patient was
   given a 500mL bolus NS.
   -Will start metoprolol 12.5mg PO daily and titrate to keep HR < 90
   -Continue to monitor urine output
   -Lasix held
   -Fluid boluses PRN HR > 100 or SBP <90
   -Continue telemetry
   #Anemia: Current HcT of 27.6 after 6 units of blood is above goal of
   25%. Likely secondary to GI bleeding as stool was guiac positive and no
   other signs/symptoms of bleeding are evident. Patient may be
   iron-deficient with low MCV (78), although TIBC is high-normal and
   serum ferritin is normal.
   -Goal of Hct > 25%, will replete as necessary.
   -Monitor crit q day
   -Iron supplementation started at 325mg PO daily.
   -Appreciate GI consult. Will not perform endoscopy per patient
   wishes. Patient is poor candidate for intubation. Will switch PPI to
   40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Serial Hct
s q month at home once discharged.
   #Fatigue/Decreased mobility: Patient complains of
not being the same
   person she was 8 days ago.
 She was able to walk across a room to a
   commode, but has not been able to do so since her illness began. Likely
   due to COPD exacerbation, but may also be decompensated CHF, or poor
   sleep due to ICU stay or obesity hyperventilation/OSA.
   -PT consult today
   -Will continue to monitor
    #Abdominal pain: Likely a peptic ulcer, as patient has had this in the
   past and would explain anemia.
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -F/U H. pylori ab
   -Appreciate GI recommendations as above.
    #CHF: Patient continues to have significant peripheral edema. Last
   echo in [**2193**]:
   IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved biventricular global and
   regional systolic function. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-1-14**], mild
   aortic stenosis is now more definitely shown. Pulmonary hypertension is
   no longer appreciated. The other findings appear similar.""
   -Echo today to assess for interval change in cardiac function.
   -Discontinue amlodipine as beta blocker has been started and pressures
   have been stable in the 110
s systolic.
   -Holding Lasix for now due to negative fluid balance and atrial
   fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
   -Metoprolol as above.
   -Continue lisinopril
    #OSA: Likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Patient did not
   tolerate BiPap overnight. Would benefit from sleep study as an
   outpatient
   -Will try cardiac chair for sleep, OOB
   -OOB to chair as tolerated
   -Will continue to try BiPap as inpatient, discuss with respiratory to
   determine optimal sleep settings, get sleep study as outpatient
   #Thrombocytopenia: 105 today and has been stable. Has been in the low
   100's for years. Has not been on heparin products, or other drugs which
   induce thrombocytopenia. Unlikely to be HIT. Could be ITP, or related
   to anemia of chronic disease. Unlikely to be DIC as there are no signs
   or symptoms of thrombosis or hemorrhage. Haptoglobin normal at 134
   mg/dL.
   -Will continue to monitor
   -Antiplatelet ab pending

Other medical conditions mentioned include anemia, likely secondary to GI bleeding, fatigue/decreased mobility, abdominal pain (likely a peptic ulcer), CHF, and thrombocytopenia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of COPD exacerbation, development of pneumonia, CHF exacerbation, further episodes of atrial fibrillation, worsening anemia, decreased mobility, worsening abdominal pain, and potential complications related to thrombocytopenia."

   #Atrial fibrillation: Patient now in sinus.  Her a.fib was likely
   secondary to volume depletion. Currently
6.8 L for LOS. Home Lasix
   dose was stopped as she is persistently negative.  She was negative 1 L
   yesterday without lasix.
   -Continue metoprolol 12.5mg PO daily and titrate to keep HR < 90
   -Lasix held to prevent further volume depletion
   -Fluid boluses PRN HR > 100 or SBP <90
   -Continue telemetry
   #Anemia: Current Hct of 28.8 today stable.  Patient had received 6
   units of blood earlier in her hospitalization.  Likely secondary to GI
   bleeding as stool was guaiac positive and no other signs/symptoms of
   bleeding are evident. Patient may be iron-deficient with low MCV (78),

    # Chronic diastolic CHF: Patient had a TTE yesterday which showed a
   normal EF and moderate AS (valve area of [**2-4**].2 cm2).  Also mod plum
   hypertension.  Amlodipine was discontinued as beta blocker has been
   started and pressures have been stable in the 110

   -Holding Lasix for now due to negative fluid balance and atrial
   fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
   -Metoprolol as above.
   -Continue lisinopril

   Assessment and Plan
   63 year-old female with a history of COPD who presents with dyspnea and
   cough x3 days, who responded to nebulizer treatments in the ED. Most
   likely diagnosis is a COPD exacerbation secondary to a viral illness,
   but pneumonia or CHF exacerbation are also in the differential.
   Developed episode of a-fib, likely due to volume depletion, but there
   may be a component of decompensated CHF as well.
   #COPD exacerbation: Likely secondary to viral illness due to low
   temperature, no leukocytosis and duration of onset. Patient appears
   comfortable now and saturating 99% on 6L NC. Will also begin short
   course of steroids to augment home treatment. Gram stain and cultures
   show OP organisms only.  Patient finished a 5 day course of levaquin on
   [**3-1**].
   -Continue albuterol nebs, home Advair diskus, Ipratroprium, and
   leukotriene inhibitor.
   -Lasix held after episode of a-fib, tachycardia, hypercarbia. Will
   re-start home dose of 40mg PO daily once heart rate and rhythm
   stabilize.
   -Prednisone 40mg PO daily x 5 days (last day [**3-5**]).
   #Atrial fibrillation: Patient now in sinus.  Her a.fib was likely
   secondary to volume depletion. Currently
6.8 L for LOS. Home Lasix
   dose was stopped as she is persistently negative.  She was negative 1 L
   yesterday without lasix.
   -Continue metoprolol 12.5mg PO daily and titrate to keep HR < 90
   -Lasix held to prevent further volume depletion
   -Fluid boluses PRN HR > 100 or SBP <90
   -Continue telemetry
   #Anemia: Current Hct of 28.8 today stable.  Patient had received 6
   units of blood earlier in her hospitalization.  Likely secondary to GI
   bleeding as stool was guaiac positive and no other signs/symptoms of
   bleeding are evident. Patient may be iron-deficient with low MCV (78),
   although TIBC is high-normal and serum ferritin is normal.  Recent
   stool has not been guaiac positive.  Goal Hct > 25.
   -Monitor crit q day
   -Iron supplementation started at 325mg PO daily.
   -Continue PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -Appreciate GI consult. Will not perform endoscopy per patient
   wishes. Patient is poor candidate for intubation. Serial Hct
s q month
   at home once discharged.
   #Fatigue/Decreased mobility: Patient complains of
not being the same
   person she was 8 days ago.
 She was able to walk across a room to a
   commode, but has not been able to do so since her illness began. Likely
   due to COPD exacerbation, but may also be decompensated CHF, or poor
   sleep due to ICU stay or obesity hyperventilation/OSA.
   -PT consult
    #Abdominal pain: Likely a peptic ulcer, as patient has had this in the
   past and would explain anemia.  Could also be due to C.diff in the
   setting of recent diarrhea.
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Will check for C.diff
   -F/U H. pylori ab
   -Appreciate GI recommendations as above.
    # Chronic diastolic CHF: Patient had a TTE yesterday which showed a
   normal EF and moderate AS (valve area of [**2-4**].2 cm2).  Also mod plum
   hypertension.  Amlodipine was discontinued as beta blocker has been
   started and pressures have been stable in the 110
s systolic.
   -Holding Lasix for now due to negative fluid balance and atrial
   fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
   -Metoprolol as above.
   -Continue lisinopril
    #OSA: Likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Patient did not
   tolerate BiPap overnight. Would benefit from sleep study as an
   outpatient
   -OOB to chair as tolerated
   -Will continue to try BiPap as inpatient, discuss with respiratory to
   determine optimal sleep settings, get sleep study as outpatient
   #Thrombocytopenia: 99 today and has been stable. Has been in the low
   100's for years. Has not been on heparin products, or other drugs which
   induce thrombocytopenia. Unlikely to be HIT. Could be ITP, or related
   to anemia of chronic disease. Unlikely to be DIC as there are no signs
   or symptoms of thrombosis or hemorrhage. Haptoglobin normal at 134
   mg/dL.
   -Will continue to monitor
   -Antiplatelet ab pending

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of COPD who presented with dyspnea and cough for three days. She was treated with nebulizer treatments in the emergency department and is now in the ICU. Her likely diagnosis is a COPD exacerbation secondary to a viral illness, but pneumonia or CHF exacerbation are also considered. The patient developed atrial fibrillation, likely due to volume depletion, and her current rhythm is sinus. She has anemia with a current Hct of 28.8%, which is stable and likely secondary to GI bleeding. The patient complains of fatigue and decreased mobility, possibly due to COPD exacerbation, decompensated CHF, poor sleep in the ICU, or obesity hypoventilation syndrome. She has abdominal pain, likely a peptic ulcer or C.diff infection. Her TTE showed normal EF and moderate AS. She has chronic diastolic CHF and OSA. Her thrombocytopenia is stable at 99 and has been in the low 100's for years.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given her history of COPD and recent respiratory symptoms, there is a risk of developing pneumonia while in the ICU.
2. CHF exacerbation: The patient's history of CHF and current symptoms suggest a possibility of CHF exacerbation.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and thrombocytopenia increase"

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   This is a 63 year-old female with a history of COPD who presents with
   dyspnea and cough x3 days, who responded to nebulizer treatments in the
   ED. Most likely diagnosis is a COPD exacerbation secondary to a viral
   illness, but pneumonia or CHF exacerbation are also in the
   differential. Developed episode of a-fib last night, likely due to
   volume depletion, but there may be a component of decompensated CHF as
   well.
   #COPD exacerbation: Likely secondary to viral illness due to low
   temperature, no leukocytosis and duration of onset. Patient appears
   comfortable now and saturating 99% on 6L NC. Will also begin short
   course of steroids to augment home treatment. Gram stain and cultures
   show OP organisms only.
   -Continue albuterol nebs, home Advair diskus, Ipratroprium, and
   leukotriene inhibitor.
   -Final dose of Levaquin today (Day 5)
   -Lasix held after episode of a-fib, tachycardia, hypercarbia. Will
   re-start home dose of 40mg PO daily once heart rate and rhythm
   stabilize.
   -Prednisone 40mg PO daily x 5 days.
   #Atrial fibrillation: Likely secondary to volume depletion. Currently
   -5.75 L for LOS. Home Lasix dose was decreased to 20mg and patient was
   given a 500mL bolus NS.
   -Will start metoprolol 12.5mg PO daily and titrate to keep HR < 90
   -Continue to monitor urine output
   -Lasix held
   -Fluid boluses PRN HR > 100 or SBP <90
   -Continue telemetry
   #Anemia: Current HcT of 27.6 after 6 units of blood is above goal of
   25%. Likely secondary to GI bleeding as stool was guiac positive and no
   other signs/symptoms of bleeding are evident. Patient may be
   iron-deficient with low MCV (78), although TIBC is high-normal and
   serum ferritin is normal.
   -Goal of Hct > 25%, will replete as necessary.
   -Monitor crit q day
   -Iron supplementation started at 325mg PO daily.
   -Appreciate GI consult. Will not perform endoscopy per patient
   wishes. Patient is poor candidate for intubation. Will switch PPI to
   40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Serial Hct
s q month at home once discharged.
   #Fatigue/Decreased mobility: Patient complains of
not being the same
   person she was 8 days ago.
 She was able to walk across a room to a
   commode, but has not been able to do so since her illness began. Likely
   due to COPD exacerbation, but may also be decompensated CHF, or poor
   sleep due to ICU stay or obesity hyperventilation/OSA.
   -PT consult today
   -Will continue to monitor
    #Abdominal pain: Likely a peptic ulcer, as patient has had this in the
   past and would explain anemia.
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -F/U H. pylori ab
   -Appreciate GI recommendations as above.
    #CHF: Patient continues to have significant peripheral edema. Last
   echo in [**2193**]:
   IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved biventricular global and
   regional systolic function. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-1-14**], mild
   aortic stenosis is now more definitely shown. Pulmonary hypertension is
   no longer appreciated. The other findings appear similar.""
   -Echo today to assess for interval change in cardiac function.
   -Discontinue amlodipine as beta blocker has been started and pressures

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   This is a 63 year-old female with a history of COPD who presents with
   dyspnea and cough x3 days, who responded to nebulizer treatments in the
   ED. Most likely diagnosis is a COPD exacerbation secondary to a viral
   illness, but pneumonia or CHF exacerbation are also in the
   differential. Developed episode of a-fib last night, likely due to
   volume depletion, but there may be a component of decompensated CHF as
   well.
   #COPD exacerbation: Likely secondary to viral illness due to low
   temperature, no leukocytosis and duration of onset. Patient appears
   comfortable now and saturating 99% on 6L NC. Will also begin short
   course of steroids to augment home treatment. Gram stain and cultures
   show OP organisms only.
   -Continue albuterol nebs, home Advair diskus, Ipratroprium, and
   leukotriene inhibitor.
   -Final dose of Levaquin today (Day 5)
   -Lasix held after episode of a-fib, tachycardia, hypercarbia. Will
   re-start home dose of 40mg PO daily once heart rate and rhythm
   stabilize.
   -Prednisone 40mg PO daily x 5 days.
   #Atrial fibrillation: Likely secondary to volume depletion. Currently
   -5.75 L for LOS. Home Lasix dose was decreased to 20mg and patient was
   given a 500mL bolus NS.
   -Will start metoprolol 12.5mg PO daily and titrate to keep HR < 90
   -Continue to monitor urine output
   -Lasix held
   -Fluid boluses PRN HR > 100 or SBP <90
   -Continue telemetry
   #Anemia: Current HcT of 27.6 after 6 units of blood is above goal of
   25%. Likely secondary to GI bleeding as stool was guiac positive and no
   other signs/symptoms of bleeding are evident. Patient may be
   iron-deficient with low MCV (78), although TIBC is high-normal and
   serum ferritin is normal.
   -Goal of Hct > 25%, will replete as necessary.
   -Monitor crit q day
   -Iron supplementation started at 325mg PO daily.
   -Appreciate GI consult. Will not perform endoscopy per patient
   wishes. Patient is poor candidate for intubation. Will switch PPI to
   40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Serial Hct
s q month at home once discharged.
   #Fatigue/Decreased mobility: Patient complains of
not being the same
   person she was 8 days ago.
 She was able to walk across a room to a
   commode, but has not been able to do so since her illness began. Likely
   due to COPD exacerbation, but may also be decompensated CHF, or poor
   sleep due to ICU stay or obesity hyperventilation/OSA.
   -PT consult today
   -Will continue to monitor
    #Abdominal pain: Likely a peptic ulcer, as patient has had this in the
   past and would explain anemia.
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   -F/U H. pylori ab
   -Appreciate GI recommendations as above.
    #CHF: Patient continues to have significant peripheral edema. Last
   echo in [**2193**]:
   IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved biventricular global and
   regional systolic function. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-1-14**], mild
   aortic stenosis is now more definitely shown. Pulmonary hypertension is
   no longer appreciated. The other findings appear similar.""
   -Echo today to assess for interval change in cardiac function.
   -Discontinue amlodipine as beta blocker has been started and pressures
   have been stable in the 110
s systolic.
   -Holding Lasix for now due to negative fluid balance and atrial
   fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
   -Metoprolol as above.
   -Continue lisinopril
    #OSA: Likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Patient did not
   tolerate BiPap overnight. Would benefit from sleep study as an
   outpatient
   -Will try cardiac chair for sleep, OOB
   -OOB to chair as tolerated
   -Will continue to try BiPap as inpatient, discuss with respiratory to
   determine optimal sleep settings, get sleep study as outpatient
   #Thrombocytopenia: 105 today and has been stable. Has been in the low
   100's for years. Has not been on heparin products, or other drugs which
   induce thrombocytopenia. Unlikely to be HIT. Could be ITP, or related
   to anemia of chronic disease. Unlikely to be DIC as there are no signs
   or symptoms of thrombosis or hemorrhage. Haptoglobin normal at 134
   mg/dL.

   and cough x3 days, likely a COPD exacerbation, also with afib w/RVR and
   a GI bleed.
   #COPD exacerbation: Likely secondary to viral illness due to low
   temperature, no leukocytosis and duration of onset. Patient appears
   comfortable now and saturating 99% on 3L NC (her home oxygen level).
   Also will begin short course of steroids to augment home treatment.
   Gram stain and cultures show OP organisms only.  Patient finished a 5
   day course of levaquin on [**3-1**].
   -Continue albuterol nebs, home Advair diskus, Ipratroprium, and
   leukotriene inhibitor.
   -Lasix held after episode of a-fib, tachycardia, hypercarbia. Will
   re-start home dose of 40mg PO daily once heart rate and rhythm
   stabilize.
   -Prednisone 40mg PO daily x 5 days (last day [**3-5**]).
   #Atrial fibrillation: Patient now in sinus.  Her a.fib was likely
   secondary to volume depletion. Currently
6.8 L for LOS. Home Lasix
   dose was stopped as she is persistently negative.  She was negative 1 L
   yesterday without lasix.
   -Continue metoprolol 12.5mg PO daily and titrate to keep HR < 90
   -Lasix held to prevent further volume depletion
   -Fluid boluses PRN HR > 100 or SBP <90
   -Continue telemetry
   #Anemia: Current Hct of 28.8 today stable.  Patient had received 6
   units of blood earlier in her hospitalization.  Likely secondary to GI
   bleeding as stool was guaiac positive and no other signs/symptoms of
   bleeding are evident. Patient may be iron-deficient with low MCV (78),
   although TIBC is high-normal and serum ferritin is normal.  Recent
   stool has not been guaiac positive.  Goal Hct > 25.
   -Monitor crit q day
   -Iron supplementation started at 325mg PO daily.
   -Continue PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -Appreciate GI consult. Will not perform endoscopy per patient
   wishes. Patient is poor candidate for intubation. Serial Hct
s q month
   at home once discharged.
   #Fatigue/Decreased mobility: Patient complains of
not being the same
   person she was 8 days ago.
 She was able to walk across a room to a
   commode, but has not been able to do so since her illness began. Likely
   due to COPD exacerbation, but may also be decompensated CHF, or poor
   sleep due to ICU stay or obesity hyperventilation/OSA.
   -PT consult
    #Abdominal pain: Likely a peptic ulcer, as patient has had this in the
   past and would explain anemia.  Could also be due to C.diff in the
   setting of recent diarrhea.
   -Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Will check for C.diff
   -F/U H. pylori ab
   -Appreciate GI recommendations as above.
    # Chronic diastolic CHF: Patient had a TTE yesterday which showed a
   normal EF and moderate AS (valve area of [**2-4**].2 cm2).  Also mod plum
   hypertension.  Amlodipine was discontinued as beta blocker has been
   started and pressures have been stable in the 110
s systolic.
   -Holding Lasix for now due to negative fluid balance and atrial
   fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
   -Metoprolol as above.
   -Continue lisinopril
    #OSA: Likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Patient did not
   tolerate BiPap overnight. Would benefit from sleep study as an
   outpatient
   -OOB to chair as tolerated
   -Will continue to try BiPap as inpatient, discuss with respiratory to
   determine optimal sleep settings, get sleep study as outpatient
   #Thrombocytopenia: 99 today and has been stable. Has been in the low
   100's for years. Has not been on heparin products, or other drugs which
   induce thrombocytopenia. Unlikely to be HIT. Could be ITP, or related
   to anemia of chronic disease. Unlikely to be DIC as there are no signs
   or symptoms of thrombosis or hemorrhage. Haptoglobin normal at 134
   mg/dL.
   -Will continue to monitor
   -Antiplatelet ab pending

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of COPD who presented with dyspnea and cough for three days. She also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and a gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's current conditions include COPD exacerbation, atrial fibrillation, anemia, fatigue/decreased mobility, abdominal pain, chronic diastolic heart failure, obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OSA), and thrombocytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Exacerbation of COPD: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and cough may indicate worsening of her COPD, leading to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response indicates an abnormal heart rhythm. If not managed properly, it can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, or other cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels suggest anemia, which may be secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding or chronic disease. Severe anemia can lead to fatigue, decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, and potentially organ dysfunction.
4. Fatigue/decreased mobility: The patient's complaint of decreased mobility and fatigue may be due to several factors including COPD exacerbation, decompensated heart failure, poor sleep quality in the ICU, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or other"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 year-old female with a history of COPD who presented with dyspnea
   and cough x3 days, likely a COPD exacerbation, also with afib w/RVR and

   #COPD exacerbation/Dyspnea: Likely secondary to viral illness due to
   low temperature, no leukocytosis and duration of onset. Patient appears
   comfortable now and saturating 99% on 3L NC (her home oxygen level).
   Was started on a short course of steroids to augment home treatment.
   Gram stain and cultures show OP organisms only.  Patient finished a 5

   -Continue albuterol nebs, home Advair diskus, Ipratroprium, and
   leukotriene inhibitor.
   -Lasix held after episode of a-fib, tachycardia, hypercarbia. Will
   re-start home dose of 40mg PO daily once heart rate and rhythm
   stabilize.
   -Prednisone 40mg PO daily x 5 days (last day [**3-5**]).
   - Patient should have a pulmonary consult to fully evaluate her dyspea
   as she states it is not improving on the usual therapy which she
   receives for her COPD.
   - Her TTE yesterday showed moderate AS with a valve area between 1-1.2
   cm2, so her SOB is unlikely to be secondary to AS.  Moderate pulmonary
   hypertension was noted and the patient has a history of DVTs and could
   have chronic PEs, however she bled in the past on coumadin and recently
   had a GI bleed, so anticoagulation would be contraindicated currently.
   #Atrial fibrillation: Patient now in sinus.  Her a.fib was likely
   secondary to volume depletion. Currently
6.8 L for LOS. Home Lasix
   dose was stopped as she is persistently negative.  She was negative 1 L
   yesterday without lasix.

   -Lasix held to prevent further volume depletion
   -Fluid boluses PRN HR > 100 or SBP <90
   -Continue telemetry
   - Holding anticoagulation given recent GI bleed.  Could consider
   starting ASA once out of the acute setting.
   #Anemia: Current Hct of 28.8, stable.  Patient had received 6 units of
   blood earlier in her hospitalization.  Likely secondary to GI bleeding
   as stool was guaiac positive and no other signs/symptoms of bleeding
   are evident. Patient may be iron-deficient with low MCV (78), although
   TIBC is high-normal and serum ferritin is normal.  Recent stool has not

   -Holding Lasix for now due to negative fluid balance and atrial
   fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
   -Continue lisinopril and metoprolol.
    #OSA: Likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Patient did not

   -Will continue to try BiPap as inpatient, discuss with respiratory to
   determine optimal sleep settings, get sleep study as outpatient
   #Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: 99 today and has been stable. Has been
   in the low 100's for years. Has not been on heparin products, or other
   drugs which induce thrombocytopenia. Unlikely to be HIT. Could be ITP,
   or related to anemia of chronic disease. Unlikely to be DIC as there
   are no signs or symptoms of thrombosis or hemorrhage. Haptoglobin
   normal at 134 mg/dL.  The patient has been pancytopenic chronically.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of COPD who presented with dyspnea and cough for three days. She also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and a gastrointestinal bleed. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for several medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD and is experiencing worsening symptoms such as dyspnea and cough. This could lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of stroke and other cardiac complications if not managed with appropriate anticoagulation therapy.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has had a GI bleed, which can result in significant blood loss and anemia. Monitoring for signs of further bleeding and ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation is essential.
4. Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's echocardiogram revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right heart strain and failure if not managed appropriately.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible chronic kidney disease. Close monitoring of renal function and managing any associated complications are necessary.
6. Iron-Deficiency Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels suggest iron-deficiency anemia. Ongoing monitoring of blood counts and addressing the underlying cause of the"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with history of obstructive lung disease now admitted to
   ICU with GI Bleed and requirement for transfusion in this setting.
   Hosptial course was complicated by Atrial Fibrillation and now with
   significant worsening of Pulmonary Artery Hypertension potentially
   related to worsening peripheral edema, persistent oxygen requirement
   and difficulty with control of atrial arrhythmia.  This is in the
   setting of substantial worsening of pulmonary artery hypertension and
   persistent dilation of atrial structures bilaterally.
   1)Respiratory Failure-There may be a component of reactive airways
   disease although is not impressive on exam throughout and response to
   nebulizers has been limited.
   -Levofloxacin continued throught today--not clearly pneumonia
   -Prednisone x 5 days for persistent wheezing although not heard on exam
   today
   -Diruesis effected independent of diuresis
   -Incentive Spirometry
   -Ambulation today
   -Will need BIPAP O/N and follow up study and examination in sleep
   clinic
   -Continue O2 and will need chronic follow up in sleep clinic and
   pulmonary clinic
   2)Atrial Fibrillation-
   -Stabilized with respiratory distress/GI Bleed controlled
   -No anticoagulation in the setting of GI Bleed
   3)GI Bleed-
   -Stable HCT
   -Will avoid

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of obstructive lung disease who was admitted to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding and required transfusion. The hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation and significant worsening of pulmonary artery hypertension, potentially related to worsening peripheral edema, persistent oxygen requirement, and difficulty with control of atrial arrhythmia.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from the information provided:

1. Respiratory Failure: There may be a component of reactive airways disease, although it is not impressive on examination throughout and response to nebulizers has been limited. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and has required oxygen supplementation.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation has been stabilized but there is a concern about anticoagulation in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is stable, but there is a need to avoid further complications such as re-bleeding or infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

- Worsening respiratory failure leading to hypoxemia and respiratory arrest.
- Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization in the ICU.
- Stroke or systemic embolism due to atrial fibrillation and associated thrombus formation.
- Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection.
- Re-ble"
