","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of multiple medical conditions including appendicitis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, dyslipidemia, asthma, and back pain. He was admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin), insulin, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, tachycardia, normal blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. The patient is on oxygen support through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 level of 94%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 7,432 mL in total intake, 3,432 mL of IV fluids, and 1,666 mL of PO fluids. The patient has received a total of 1,720 mL of blood products. Urine output is 820 mL. 

Physical examination findings are not available for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments due to non-assessment. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 10.7 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 191 mg/dL, low sodium level of 0.9 mg/dL, normal potassium level of 25 m"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. He has a history of acute appendicitis and is currently being treated conservatively with intravenous antibiotics. The patient's pain has remained unchanged overnight, and he has been using Dilaudid every two to three hours for pain management. The patient is febrile with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), and his heart rate is slightly elevated at 111 bpm. His blood pressure is within normal range, and his respiratory rate is increased. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on a nasal cannula, and he is on mechanical ventilation support. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission. The patient has a ruptured appendix secondary to acute appendicitis and is being treated conservatively with IV antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and suspected appendicitis, there is a risk of developing sepsis due to the spread of infection.
2. Abscess Formation: If the appendix ruptures, it can lead to the formation of an abscess in the abdominal cavity, which may require surgical intervention.
3. Peritonitis: Inflammation of the peritoneum can occur if the appendix ruptures and causes contamination of the abdominal cavity.
4. Prolonged ICU Stay: The patient's condition may worsen, leading to a longer duration of ICU"

He is currently being treated conservatively with intravenous antibiotics (Cipro/Flagyl) and pain management with morphine as needed. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 37.9°C (100.2°F), elevated heart rate of 123 bpm, and slightly low blood pressure ranging from 113-164/53-96 mmHg. Respiratory rate is within normal limits at 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 98% with the use of a nasal cannula. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 5,523 mL with an output of 925 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,598 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The EKG is stable, suggesting no immediate cardiac concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and signs of infection, there is a potential risk for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential to detect any deterioration.
2. Organ dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes and low hemoglobin levels may indicate potential organ dysfunction, which needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.

 SOB episode and CXR changes: possible infiltrate in left lower lung
   vs edema. WBC mildly elevated, but may be from abd infection. Pt lays
   on left side, which if it is fluid, may be why it is more visibel on
   left. However, did have some emesis and is at risk fo aspiration
   peumonitis. No current resp sx and afebrile.
