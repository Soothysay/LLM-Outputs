   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 54 yo M with IPF currently under
   evaluation for lung transplant at [**Hospital1 966**] who is admitted with worsening
   hypoxia and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to superimposed pna on patient
   with no pulmonary reserve.  Appears he has been experiencing worsening
   dyspnea with increased O2 requirement for the last several weeks
   looking back through OMR discharge summaries. Unable to appreciate a
   clear infiltrate on CXR given underlying fibrosis.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be acute
   exacerbation of underlying IPF
   - Continue NAC
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] hold on CT chest for further characterization,
   last was on [**2141-2-1**]
   - Will treat for presumed HCAP/HAP given recent stay at [**Date Range 1560**] rehab and
   multiple admission with vanc/meropenem given pcn allergy
   - A-line
   - Would consider hi dose steroids for IPF tx, but given high fevers and
   leukocytosis with hold for now
   - Send sputum culture
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to contact [**Name (NI) 966**] for update on transplant status.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Differential includes pneumonia or possibly
   urinary tract infection.  No recent report of diarrhea or other
   complaints.  UA sent in the ED was contaminated.  No clear infiltrate
   on CXR, though difficult to ascertain given underlying fibrosis.
   Lactate 1.1.
   - Resend UA/ucx
   - Continue fever work up
   - Follow diff, pending at this time
   - CIS
   - Abx as above
   - Cont IVF as likely insensible losses from fevers and NPO, currently
   normotensive
   .
   # Elevated troponin: Sent from ED, first set of enzymes with trop of
   0.16, CK 142, MB fraction 7.  No ECG from ED, ECG from OSH showing
   indeterminate axis, sinus tach, no clear ischemic changes.
   - Repeat ECG now
   - Trend CE
   - Will hold on heparin for now as trop leak likely in the setting of
   demand given respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   - ECHO now
   .
   # Tachycardia:
   .
   # Anemia: Stable, at baseline of 38-40.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, NPO for now, will initiate
   Nutrition consult for TF
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, lansoprazole, bowel

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who presented with worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. He is currently under evaluation for lung transplant. The patient has been experiencing increasing dyspnea and increased O2 requirement for the past several weeks. There is no clear infiltrate on the chest X-ray, but it is difficult to ascertain due to underlying fibrosis. The patient has a penicillin allergy and has been treated with vancomycin and meropenem empirically.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has no pulmonary reserve, which makes him more susceptible to respiratory failure. This could be secondary to superimposed pneumonia or an acute exacerbation of underlying IPF.
2. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which can be caused by pneumonia or possibly a urinary tract infection. No recent report of diarrhea or other complaints has been mentioned.
3. Elevated troponin: The patient has an elevated troponin level, indicating possible cardiac damage. However, it may also be due to a troponin leak caused by respiratory distress and tachycardia.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, which could be secondary to fever, hypoxia, or stress.
5. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia at baseline levels of 38-"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 54 yo M with IPF currently under
   evaluation for lung transplant at [**Hospital1 966**] who is admitted with worsening
   hypoxia and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to superimposed pna on patient
   with no pulmonary reserve.  Appears he has been experiencing worsening
   dyspnea with increased O2 requirement for the last several weeks
   looking back through OMR discharge summaries. Unable to appreciate a
   clear infiltrate on CXR given underlying fibrosis.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be acute
   exacerbation of underlying IPF. Was persistently hypercarbic overnight
   despite tweaking of vent settings. Currently experiencing high plateau
   and peak pressures. CXR appears improved in RLL.
   - Will try pressure control 20/5 or 25/5, recheck ABG
   - Continue NAC
   - Per Dr. [**Name (NI) **] (pt
s outpt pulmonologist), will hold on CT chest
   for further characterization, last was on [**2141-2-1**].
   - Continue vanc/aztreonam/cipro for HAP given PCN allergy.
   - Will hold off on steroids since it would make it ineligible to
   receive a transplant lung
   .
   # Hemodynamics: pt required heavy sedation in order to synchronize with
   vent, which caused drop in BP. Now on two pressors (levophed,
   vasopressin) for BP support. Not responsive to fluids.
   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test pending
   - No steroids unless absolutely indicated since it will exclude him
   from transplant list.
   - Try to wean off vasopression then levophed as tolerated. If a third
   pressor is necessary, would add dobutamine. NO to vasodilate [**Last Name (un) 1560**]
   vasculature would be next choice.
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Highest on differential list is PNA. U/A clear.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - abx as above
   .
   # Elevated troponin: ruled in with positive cardiac enzymes. Trop-T
   peaked at 0.16, now downward trending.
   No ECG from ED, ECG from OSH showing indeterminate axis, sinus tach, no
   clear ischemic changes.
   - Will hold on heparin for now as trop leak likely in the setting of
   demand given respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   - Echo showing increased RV pressure.
   .
   # Anemia: Lower than baseline of 38-40, however likely hemodilutional.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # FEN: TF started yesterday then stopped due to brief period of
   paralysis. Will re-challenge today. Replete lytes PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who is currently being evaluated for lung transplantation. He was admitted with worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating over the past several weeks, and there is suspicion of superimposed pneumonia (PNA) on his underlying IPF. There are no clear infiltrates seen on chest X-ray due to underlying fibrosis, but the patient's condition is improving in the right lower lung. The patient is experiencing high plateau and peak pressures, and his ABG results show persistent hypercarbia despite adjustments to the ventilator settings.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing worsening dyspnea with increased O2 requirement, indicating respiratory failure secondary to superimposed PNA on his underlying IPF. There is also an acute exacerbation of underlying IPF.
2. Hemodynamics: The patient required heavy sedation to synchronize with the ventilator, which caused a drop in blood pressure. He is currently on two pressors (levophed, vasopressin) for blood pressure support and is not responsive to fluids.
3. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, with the highest differential being PNA. Urinalysis is clear, and cultures are pending. Antibiotics have been started as per the above plan.
4. Elevated troponin: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with history of IPF and now with hypoxemic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.  Following intubation patient did have significant
   hemoptysis following mini-BAL procedure--no ongoing bleeding seen but
   with significant clot in airways.  Across the night patient has
   significant worsening of hypercarbia and requiring multiple changes in
   mode of ventilatory support delivery with improvement in CO2.
   1)Respiratory Failure-This would appear secondary to IPF exacerbation.
   He has not had documented infection to date but does have concerning
   fevers and elevated WBC count but has no significant culture results to
   date.
   -Continue vanco/Aztreonam/Cipro
   -Will continue in A/C mode of support with PIP-40 and Pplat=38
   -As infiltrates resolve and with some decrease in clot volume being
   cleared would continue to attempt to provide safer ventilatory support
   -Will continue deep sedation
   -Hold paralytics
   2)Shock-This is likely related to Right heart compromise and
   significant change in PVR impairing effective stroke volume and in the
   setting of high levels of sedation patient has need for both effective
   volume replacement and adequate stroke volume.  In addition, patient
   has concern given elevated WBC count, fever but no positive culture
   results to suggest possible but not confirmed sepsis.
   -Keep CVP at 10-11 given likely significant elevation in Pleural
   Pressures
   -Would not elevated CVP above 12 as have given 7 liters to get to [**10-1**]
   measured CVP
   -Will continue with Levophed for pressure support
   -Follow up culture results
   -[**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim done and results pending but would not start steroids
   without considering impact on transplant status
   -Continue with pneumonia treatment as above.
   3)Myocardial Ischemia-Troponin positive, may be demand ischemia
   -Troponin trending down
   -Follow up ECG in morning
   -Follow for recurrent ischemia

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who has developed hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was intubated after significant hemoptysis following a mini-balloon procedure. The patient's condition has worsened, with persistent hypercarbia despite pressure control ventilation. He is febrile and has an elevated white blood cell count. Imaging shows improved right lower lobe opacities but no evidence of pneumothorax. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to an IPF exacerbation. He also has signs of right heart compromise and potential sepsis. The patient's myocardial ischemia is trending down, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to an exacerbation of IPF. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma should be monitored for.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing shock related to right heart compromise and significant changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). This can impair effective stroke volume and lead to inadequate tissue perfusion. Monitoring for signs of hypotension, poor urine output, and altered mental status is important.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, fever, and lack of positive culture results suggest a possible but not confirmed sepsis. Close monitoring for further signs of infection and organ"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 54 yo M with IPF currently under evaluation for lung
   transplant at [**Hospital1 966**] who is admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to superimposed PNA on patient
   with no pulmonary reserve.  Appears he has been experiencing worsening
   dyspnea with increased O2 requirement for the last several weeks.
   Unable to appreciate a clear infiltrate on CXR given underlying
   fibrosis.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be acute exacerbation of underlying IPF. Per Dr.
   [**Name (NI) **] (pt
s outpt pulmonologist), will hold on CT chest for further
   characterization, last was on [**2141-2-1**]. CXR appears improved in RLL.
   Patient taken off the lung transplant list [**3-11**]. AC with TV 400, rate
   35, PEEP 5
 Goal peak pressures 40 or less. ABGs normalizing.
   - Continue NAC
   - Continue vanc/aztreonam/cipro for HAP given PCN allergy.
   - Will change to amikacin if worsens
   - Try to reduce peak pressures/FiO2 as tolerated today
   .
   # Hemodynamics: pt required heavy sedation in order to synchronize with
   vent, which caused drop in BP. Now on two pressors (levophed,
   vasopressin) for BP support. Not responsive to fluids.
   - Try to wean off vasopression then levophed as tolerated.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Trending down. Likely PNA. U/A clear.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - abx as above
   .
   # Elevated troponin: ruled in with positive cardiac enzymes. Trop-T
   peaked at 0.16, now downward trending.
   No ECG from ED, ECG from OSH showing indeterminate axis, sinus tach, no
   clear ischemic changes. Will hold on heparin for now as trop leak
   likely in the setting of demand given respiratory distress and
   tachycardia. Echo showing increased RV pressure.
   .
   # Anemia: Slowly falling. Lower than baseline of 38-40, however likely
   hemodilutional. If rebleeds from ETT, turn patient R lateral recumbent
   and call IP.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # High tube feed residuals. Possible obstruction vs. ileus due to
   paralytics and narcotics
   - KUB for obstruction
   .
   # FEN: TF stopped due to high residuals. Replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 54 yo M with IPF currently under evaluation for lung
   transplant at [**Hospital1 966**] who is admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to superimposed PNA on patient
   with no pulmonary reserve.  Appears he has been experiencing worsening
   dyspnea with increased O2 requirement for the last several weeks.
   Unable to appreciate a clear infiltrate on CXR given underlying
   fibrosis.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be acute exacerbation of underlying IPF. Per Dr.
   [**Name (NI) **] (pt
s outpt pulmonologist), will hold on CT chest for further
   characterization, last was on [**2141-2-1**]. CXR appears improved in RLL.
   Patient taken off the lung transplant list [**3-11**]. AC with TV 400, rate
   35, PEEP 5
 Goal peak pressures 40 or less. ABGs normalizing.
   - Continue NAC
   - Continue vanc/aztreonam/cipro for HAP given PCN allergy.
   - Try to reduce peak pressures/FiO2 as tolerated today
   .
   # Hemodynamics: pt required heavy sedation in order to synchronize with
   vent, which caused drop in BP. Now on two pressors (levophed,
   vasopressin) for BP support. Not responsive to fluids.
   - Try to wean off vasopression then levophed as tolerated. If a third
   pressor is necessary, would add dobutamine. NO to vasodilate pulm
   vasculature would be next choice.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Trending down. Likely PNA. U/A clear.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - abx as above
   .
   # Elevated troponin: ruled in with positive cardiac enzymes. Trop-T
   peaked at 0.16, now downward trending.
   No ECG from ED, ECG from OSH showing indeterminate axis, sinus tach, no
   clear ischemic changes.
   - Will hold on heparin for now as trop leak likely in the setting of
   demand given respiratory distress and tachycardia.
   - Echo showing increased RV pressure.
   .
   # Anemia: Slowly falling. Lower than baseline of 38-40, however likely
   hemodilutional.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # FEN: TF stopped due to high residuals. Will re-challenge today.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 54-year-old male with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. He has been experiencing increasing dyspnea with higher oxygen requirements over the last few weeks. There is no clear infiltrate on the chest X-ray due to underlying fibrosis. The patient's lung transplant evaluation has been placed on hold.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and a PEEP level of 5 cmH2O. His blood pressure is unstable and requires two vasopressors (levophed and vasopressin) for support. He is also sedated to synchronize with the ventilator.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis are trending down, likely due to pneumonia. He has elevated troponin levels, which peaked at 0.16 and is now downward trending. An echocardiogram shows increased right ventricular pressure. The patient's anemia is slowly falling but is likely due to hemodilution. His fluids have been restricted due to high urine output.

The patient is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and bowel regimen. He has peripheral IV lines, an arterial line, and a radial internal jugular (RIJ) line. His code status is full code, and he requires ICU level of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who was admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. He has been experiencing increasing dyspnea and increased O2 requirement over the past few weeks. The patient's CXR shows no clear infiltrate, but there is improvement in the right lower lobe. He was taken off the lung transplant list due to sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, requiring heavy sedation to synchronize with the ventilator. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 96/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 insp/min, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has crackles and rhonchi bilaterally on lung examination. His blood work shows leukocytosis with a WBC count of 19.3 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of 0.11, and lactic acid level of 1.6 mmol/L. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and pressors. He is also receiving prophylactic heparin, pantoprazole, and bowel regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure indicate potential complications related to his underlying IPF and superimposed pneumonia. The lack of a clear"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient remains on two pressors, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. They have been taken off the lung transplant list due to the likelihood of sepsis. 

The patient's vital signs show a fever (Tmax: 38.2 C, Tcurrent: 37.9 C), tachycardia (HR: 88 bpm), hypotension (BP: 96/59 mmHg), and respiratory depression (RR: 0 insp/min). The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% and their heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 4,728 mL and output of 1,242 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's CVP is 5 mmHg, which is within the normal range.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, set Vt of 400 mL, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and a high respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) due to the use of high levels of FiO2. The ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with an increased PaCO2 of 118 mmHg and decreased pH of 7.31.

The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 19.3 K"

The patient is a 66-inch-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient remains intubated and on two pressors. He has been taken off the lung transplant list due to sepsis. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74/55 mmHg to 96/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 insp/min, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 5 mmHg, total fluid input of 4,728 mL, and total fluid output of 1,242 mL. The patient has received various medications including vasopressin, fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. His lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 19.3 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 134 mEq/L, hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 166 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles and rhonchi bilaterally, tachycardia, hyperdynamic CV, soft and nondistended abdomen, trace edema, and withdrawal to pain."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with IPF and admit with combined hypoxemic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure related to progression of IPF with significant
   concern for evolution of significant infection given fevers and
   hypotension.  Today he has some significant decrease in fever but still
   at 100.7.  He remains on pressors for decrease in BP which is related
   both to right heart compromise, increased PAP's but can not rule out
   decreased SVR.  Of note patient has had improved oxygenation with
   support and improved effective ventilation.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Secondary to above-->
   -Continue with A/C support--with increase in effective ventilation will
   consider decrease in Vt given persistent elevation in PIP at 40 and
   PCO2 with trend to down with change made should PCO2 be seen to further
   decrease to <60
   -Versed/Fentanyl
   -Continue NAC
   -No change in vent support this morning
   -Goal FIO2=0.5-0.6
   2)Sepsis-Concern
   -Levophed--0.3
   -Vasopressin--0.04
   -There is likely a significant component of right heart compromise
   contribution to the hypotension
the bias has been against significant
   volume loading given concern for worsening of pulmonary gas exchange
   should pulmonary edema be seen.  Additional rationale is CVP is
   measured as low as well
   -Will trial volume challenge today
   -Vanco/Aztreonam/Cipro
   -Consider Amikacin for worsening
   3)Pulmonary Fibrosis-
   -Continue NAC
need to clarify dose with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60**]
   [**Name (STitle) 4969**] currently inactive on transplant list due to severity of
   medical illness
   -Will continue to update [**Hospital1 966**] over next days in regards to pulmonary and
   fever status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a diagnosis of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) admitted with combined hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently experiencing significant concerns regarding the progression of IPF, fevers, hypotension, and right heart compromise.

The patient's vital signs show tachypnea (rapid breathing), hypotension (low blood pressure), and a heart rate within normal limits. The patient's oxygen saturation level is 90%, indicating some degree of respiratory compromise. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including vasopressor support (Levophed and Vasopressin) to maintain blood pressure, as well as antibiotics (Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Ciprofloxacin) for suspected infection. The patient is also on fentanyl and midazolam for sedation, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for potential lung protection.

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis reveals respiratory acidosis with an elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and a decreased partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). The white blood cell count is elevated, suggesting an infection.

The patient's lab results show a decreased hemoglobin level and hematocrit, indicating anemia. The platelet count is within normal limits. Renal function tests show normal serum"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 54 yo M with IPF currently under evaluation for lung
   transplant at [**Hospital1 966**] who is admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to superimposed PNA on patient
   with no pulmonary reserve.  Appears he has been experiencing worsening
   dyspnea with increased O2 requirement for the last several weeks.
   Unable to appreciate a clear infiltrate on CXR given underlying
   fibrosis.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be acute exacerbation of underlying IPF. Per Dr.
   [**Name (NI) **] (pt
s outpt pulmonologist), will hold on CT chest for further
   characterization, last was on [**2141-2-1**]. CXR appears improved in RLL.
   Patient taken off the lung transplant list [**3-11**]. AC with TV 400, rate
   35, PEEP 5
 Goal peak pressures 40 or less. ABGs normalizing.
   - Continue NAC
   - Continue vanc/aztreonam/cipro for HAP given PCN allergy.
   - Will change to amikacin if worsens
   - Try to reduce peak pressures/FiO2 as tolerated today
   .
   # Hemodynamics: pt required heavy sedation in order to synchronize with
   vent, which caused drop in BP. Now on two pressors (levophed,
   vasopressin) for BP support. Not responsive to fluids.
   - Try to wean off vasopression then levophed as tolerated.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Trending down. Likely PNA. U/A clear.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - abx as above
   .
   # Elevated troponin: ruled in with positive cardiac enzymes. Trop-T
   peaked at 0.16, now downward trending.
   No ECG from ED, ECG from OSH showing indeterminate axis, sinus tach, no
   clear ischemic changes. Will hold on heparin for now as trop leak
   likely in the setting of demand given respiratory distress and
   tachycardia. Echo showing increased RV pressure.
   .
   # Anemia: Slowly falling. Lower than baseline of 38-40, however likely
   hemodilutional. If rebleeds from ETT, turn patient R lateral recumbent
   and call IP.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # High tube feed residuals. Possible obstruction vs. ileus due to
   paralytics and narcotics
   - KUB for obstruction
   .
   # FEN: TF stopped due to high residuals. Replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: peripherals (2 18 gauge, 1 20 gauge), A-line, RIJ
   .
   # Code: Full
   .
   # Communication: Family
 needs family meeting today to discuss
   duration of ventilation as patient had expressed wish for no prolonged
   intubation
   .
   # Disposition: requires ICU level of care

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of IPF who was admitted with worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. He has been experiencing increasing dyspnea and increased O2 requirements over the last several weeks. There is no clear infiltrate on the chest X-ray due to underlying fibrosis, but there may be an acute exacerbation of underlying IPF. The patient was taken off the lung transplant list on [**3-11**]. He is currently on assisted ventilation with TV 400, rate 35, PEEP 5, and ABGs are normalizing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure secondary to superimposed PNA on a patient with no pulmonary reserve. He has worsening dyspnea and increased O2 requirements, which indicates a decline in respiratory function.
2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient required heavy sedation to synchronize with the vent, causing a drop in blood pressure. He is currently on two pressors (levophed, vasopressin) for BP support and is not responsive to fluids. This suggests hemodynamic instability and the need for close monitoring and management.
3. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient had a fever and leukocytosis, likely due to PNA. Cultures are pending, and he is receiving appropriate antibiotics.
4. Elevated Troponin: The patient has an elevated troponin level, indicating possible cardiac involvement"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 54 yo M with IPF currently under evaluation for lung
   transplant at [**Hospital1 966**] who is admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to superimposed PNA on patient
   with no pulmonary reserve.  Appears he has been experiencing worsening
   dyspnea with increased O2 requirement for the last several weeks.
   Unable to appreciate a clear infiltrate on CXR given underlying
   fibrosis.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be acute exacerbation of underlying IPF. Per Dr.
   [**Name (NI) **] (pt
s outpt pulmonologist), will hold on CT chest for further
   characterization, last was on [**2141-2-1**]. CXR appears improved in RLL.
   Patient taken off the lung transplant list [**3-11**]. AC with TV 400, rate
   35, PEEP 5
 Goal peak pressures 40 or less. ABGs normalizing.
   - Continue NAC
   - Continue vanc/aztreonam/cipro for HAP given PCN allergy.
   - Will change to amikacin if worsens
   - Try to reduce peak pressures/FiO2 as tolerated today
   .
   # Hemodynamics: pt required heavy sedation in order to synchronize with
   vent, which caused drop in BP. Now on two pressors (levophed,
   vasopressin) for BP support. Not responsive to fluids.
   - Try to wean off vasopression then levophed as tolerated.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: Trending down. Likely PNA. U/A clear.
   - f/u pending cultures
   - abx as above
   .
   # Elevated troponin: ruled in with positive cardiac enzymes. Trop-T
   peaked at 0.16, now downward trending.
   No ECG from ED, ECG from OSH showing indeterminate axis, sinus tach, no
   clear ischemic changes. Will hold on heparin for now as trop leak
   likely in the setting of demand given respiratory distress and
   tachycardia. Echo showing increased RV pressure.
   .
   # Anemia: Slowly falling. Lower than baseline of 38-40, however likely
   hemodilutional. If rebleeds from ETT, turn patient R lateral recumbent
   and call IP.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # High tube feed residuals. Possible obstruction vs. ileus due to
   paralytics and narcotics
   - KUB for obstruction
   .
   # FEN: TF stopped due to high residuals. Replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: peripherals (2 18 gauge, 1 20 gauge), A-line, RIJ

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors including respiratory failure due to superimposed pneumonia on a patient with no pulmonary reserve, potential acute exacerbation of underlying IPF, and cardiac issues indicated by elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of superimposed pneumonia on a patient with no pulmonary reserve. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function and increased hypoxia.
2. Acute Exacerbation of IPF: The patient may be experiencing an acute exacerbation of underlying IPF, which can worsen lung function and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac Issues: Elevated troponin levels suggest cardiac involvement, possibly myocardial injury. This could be due to stress on the heart from increased oxygen demand or other underlying cardiac conditions.
4. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, indicating an infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the source and appropriate treatment.
5. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient requires heavy sedation to synchronize with the ventilator, causing a drop in blood pressure. He is also on two pressors (levophed, vasopressin) for blood pressure support, indicating hemodynamic instability"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes being evaluated for lung transplant and currently under evaluation at Hospital1 966.

The patient's current conditions and assessments are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has superimposed pneumonia (PNA) on top of no pulmonary reserve. There is worsening dyspnea with increased O2 requirement over the last several weeks, and an acute exacerbation of underlying IPF is suspected. A CT chest will be done for further characterization.

2. Hemodynamics: The patient required heavy sedation to synchronize with the ventilator, causing a drop in blood pressure. The patient was able to be weaned off vasopressin overnight and should be weaned down on levophed as tolerated.

3. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient's WBC is trending down, indicating a possible PNA. The urine analysis (U/A) is clear, but the patient has thicker secretions today. Sputum cultures have been resent, and antibiotic therapy will be continued as before.

4. Elevated troponin: Troponin levels peaked at 0.16 and are now downward trending. There is a possibility of cardiac enzymes leak due to respiratory distress and tachycardia. An echocardiogram shows increased RV pressure. H"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with h/o IPF now admitted with persistent hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.  He had significant increase in FIO2 required.
   This did seem to correspond with acute re-positioning but patient also
   with positive fluid balance across the 24 hour period at 3.5 liters.
   He has had no change in hemoptysis and suctioning has been without
   significant changes.  Of note Temp <100 for 24 hours.  He has zeroed
   CVP of 11 this morning and has PIP=36 which appears to be reasonably
   optimal.  In that setting we have been able to effect some increase in
   urine flow and decrease in pressors.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Is likely a component of fixed underlying lung
   disease worsened by intercurrent infection.
   -IPF
Continue NAC
   -Continue with volume cycled ventilation
   -Would minimize dead space if further rise in CO2 noted
   -Wean FIO2 as needed
   2)Hypotension
[**Month (only) 11**] be a component of sepsis, has functional hypovolemia
   with fluid responsiveness noted yesterday.
   -Versed/Fentanyl
   -Follow up sputum sample
some concern for increased secretions
   -Continue with ABX
   3)Pulmonary Fibrosis-
   -Patient with concerning persistence of respiratory failure and with
   increased secretion volume
   -Inactive on transplant list at this time
   -Will repeat CXR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who is currently admitted with persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient required an increased fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) due to desaturations overnight following repositioning. 

The patient has been on vasopressin and norepinephrine, both of which have been weaned down. Blood cultures were obtained on 03/12/2141 at 10:00 AM, urine culture at the same time, and sputum culture at 12:02 PM on 03/12/2141.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and an unknown allergy. Antibiotics administered include vancomycin on 03/12/2141 at 08:43 PM, ciprofloxacin on 03/13/2141 at 12:02 AM, and aztreonam on 03/13/2141 at 06:42 AM.

The patient is receiving sedation with midazolam (versed) at a rate of 10 mg/hour and fentanyl at 100 mcg/hour. Norepinephrine is being infused at 0.25 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 93 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 21-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis. His past medical history includes pleural disease, pneumonia, pneumothorax, chronic respiratory failure, and alteration in nutrition. The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, and is receiving various medications such as fentanyl, norepinephrine, midazolam, and heparin. His vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 101.8°F (38.8°C), heart rate between 86-112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 79/65-88/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99% on FiO2 70%. The patient's echocardiogram shows severe dilation of the right ventricle and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, with normal left ventricular function. Blood cultures were taken, and the patient received antibiotics (Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Ciprofloxacin) for suspected sepsis. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16.3 K/uL, elevated CRP level of 25.1 mg/dL, and signs of acute kidney injury with a creatinine"

   In comparison with the study of [**3-13**], there is little interval
   change. Support and monitoring devices remain in place. Widespread
   bilateral
   pulmonary opacifications persist. Enlargement of the trachea is again
   noted,
   unchanged from the previous study.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 54 yo M with IPF currently under evaluation for lung
   transplant at [**Hospital1 966**] who is admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to superimposed PNA on patient
   with no pulmonary reserve due to IPF.  Appears he has been experiencing
   worsening dyspnea with increased O2 requirement for the last several
   weeks. Unable to appreciate a clear infiltrate on CXR given underlying
   fibrosis.  Per Dr. [**Name (NI) **] (pt
s outpt pulmonologist), will hold on CT
   chest for further characterization, last was on [**2141-2-1**]. Patient taken
   off the lung transplant list [**3-11**] (is
inactive
 at this time). Due to
   ECHO results, patient is no longer a transplant candidate. Will address
   this with family today.
   - AC with TV 400, rate 35, PEEP 8
 Goal peak pressures 40 or less.
   - Wean down FiO2 as tolerated. Will monitor ABGs.
   - Continue NAC.
   - Continue vanc/aztreonam/cipro for HAP given PCN allergy.
   - Will change to amikacin if worsens or if cultures necessitate
   antibiotic change.
   - no steroids for now
   .
   # Hemodynamics: pt required heavy sedation in order to synchronize with
   vent, which caused drop in BP. Not responsive to fluids.
   - Wean down on levophed as tolerated.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: WBC trending down. Likely PNA. U/A clear. Having
   thicker secretions today
   - f/u pending sputum/blood cultures
   - abx as above
   .
   # Elevated troponin: ruled in with positive cardiac enzymes. Trop-T
   peaked at 0.16, now downward trending.
   No ECG from ED, ECG from OSH showing indeterminate axis, sinus tach, no
   clear ischemic changes. Will hold on heparin for now as trop leak
   likely in the setting of demand given respiratory distress and
   tachycardia. Echo showing increased RV pressure.
   .
   # Anemia: Slowly falling. Lower than baseline of 38-40, however at
   least partly hemodilutional. If rebleeds from ETT, turn patient R
   lateral recumbent and call IP.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # High tube feed residuals. Possible obstruction vs. ileus due to
   paralytics and narcotics; KUB negative for obstruction. Now tolerating
   tube feeds. Will continue to monitor.
   .
   # FEN: Tube Feeds. Replete lytes PRN

   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen

   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4473**], MD  PGY-1
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) admitted to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. He requires mechanical ventilation with increased FiO2 and PEEP.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin levels, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The echocardiogram reveals severely dilated and moderately hypokinetic right ventricle with at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The chest X-ray indicates widespread bilateral pulmonary opacifications and enlargement of the trachea.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to superimposed pneumonia on top of IPF, which has resulted in worsening dyspnea and increased O2 requirement. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection, likely pneumonia. There is a risk of progression or development of other infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Cardiac Complications: The elevated troponin levels indicate cardiac injury, and the echocardiogram findings suggest right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. There is a risk of worsening cardiac function and potential development of cardi"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who is currently being evaluated for a lung transplant. He was admitted with worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing dyspnea with increased O2 requirement for the last several weeks, indicating a progressive decline in respiratory function.

The patient's vital signs show fever, elevated heart rate, and low blood pressure. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with increased FiO2 and PEEP. The respiratory support parameters indicate a need for higher levels of oxygen and increased pressure to maintain adequate ventilation.

The physical examination reveals crackles and rhonchi bilaterally, suggesting pulmonary edema or congestion. The patient's central venous oxygen saturation is low at 78%. The echocardiogram shows severe dilatation and moderate hypokinesis of the right ventricle, with at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. This finding indicates right ventricular dysfunction and increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries.

The laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, and elevated troponin-T levels, which may suggest cardiac injury or myocardial infarction. The microbiology results are negative for RSV, but the sputum gram stain shows >25 PMNs and <10 epith"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 54 yo M with IPF currently under evaluation for lung
   transplant at [**Hospital1 966**] who is admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to superimposed PNA on patient
   with no pulmonary reserve.  Appears he has been experiencing worsening
   dyspnea with increased O2 requirement for the last several weeks.
   Unable to appreciate a clear infiltrate on CXR given underlying
   fibrosis.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be acute exacerbation of underlying IPF. Per Dr.
   [**Name (NI) **] (pt
s outpt pulmonologist), will hold on CT chest for further
   characterization, last was on [**2141-2-1**].
   Patient taken off the lung transplant list [**3-11**] (is
inactive
 at this
   time)
   - AC with TV 400, rate 35, PEEP 5
 Goal peak pressures 40 or less.
   - Wean down FiO2 as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/aztreonam/cipro for HAP given PCN allergy.
   - Will change to amikacin if worsens
   - no steroids for now
   .
   # Hemodynamics: pt required heavy sedation in order to synchronize with
   vent, which caused drop in BP. Not responsive to fluids.
   - Wean down on levophed as tolerated.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: WBC trending down. Likely PNA. U/A clear. Having
   thicker secretions today
   - resend sputum culture
   - f/u pending cultures
   - abx as above
   .
   # Elevated troponin: ruled in with positive cardiac enzymes. Trop-T
   peaked at 0.16, now downward trending.
   No ECG from ED, ECG from OSH showing indeterminate axis, sinus tach, no
   clear ischemic changes. Will hold on heparin for now as trop leak
   likely in the setting of demand given respiratory distress and
   tachycardia. Echo showing increased RV pressure.
   .
   # Anemia: Slowly falling. Lower than baseline of 38-40, however at
   least partly hemodilutional. If rebleeds from ETT, turn patient R
   lateral recumbent and call IP.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # High tube feed residuals. Possible obstruction vs. ileus due to
   paralytics and narcotics; KUB negative for obstruction. Now tolerating
   tube feeds.
   - monitor
   # FEN: TF restarted. Replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: peripherals (2 18 gauge, 1 20 gauge), A-line, RIJ
   .
   # Code: Full
   .
   # Communication: Family
 discussion regarding goals of care ongoing.
   .
   # Disposition: requires ICU level of care

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 54 yo M with IPF currently under evaluation for lung
   transplant at [**Hospital1 966**] who is admitted with worsening hypoxia and
   respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  [**Month (only) 11**] be secondary to superimposed PNA on patient
   with no pulmonary reserve.  Appears he has been experiencing worsening
   dyspnea with increased O2 requirement for the last several weeks.
   Unable to appreciate a clear infiltrate on CXR given underlying
   fibrosis.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be acute exacerbation of underlying IPF. Per Dr.
   [**Name (NI) **] (pt
s outpt pulmonologist), will hold on CT chest for further
   characterization, last was on [**2141-2-1**].
   Patient taken off the lung transplant list [**3-11**] (is
inactive
 at this
   time)
   - AC with TV 400, rate 35, PEEP 5
 Goal peak pressures 40 or less.
   - Wean down FiO2 as tolerated
   - Continue vanc/aztreonam/cipro for HAP given PCN allergy.
   - Will change to amikacin if worsens
   - f/u CXR from this morning
   - no steroids for now
   .
   # Hemodynamics: pt required heavy sedation in order to synchronize with
   vent, which caused drop in BP. Not responsive to fluids. Was able to be
   weaned off vasopressin overnight.
   - Wean down on levophed as tolerated.
   .
   # Fever/leukocytosis: WBC trending down. Likely PNA. U/A clear. Having
   thicker secretions today
   - resend sputum culture
   - f/u pending cultures
   - abx as above
   .
   # Elevated troponin: ruled in with positive cardiac enzymes. Trop-T
   peaked at 0.16, now downward trending.
   No ECG from ED, ECG from OSH showing indeterminate axis, sinus tach, no
   clear ischemic changes. Will hold on heparin for now as trop leak
   likely in the setting of demand given respiratory distress and
   tachycardia. Echo showing increased RV pressure.
   .
   # Anemia: Slowly falling. Lower than baseline of 38-40, however at
   least partly hemodilutional. If rebleeds from ETT, turn patient R
   lateral recumbent and call IP.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   # High tube feed residuals. Possible obstruction vs. ileus due to
   paralytics and narcotics; KUB negative for obstruction. Now tolerating
   tube feeds.
   - monitor
   # FEN: TF restarted. Replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who is admitted with worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing increasing dyspnea and increased oxygen requirement for the past several weeks. There is no clear infiltrate on chest X-ray due to underlying fibrosis, and a CT chest is pending for further characterization.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, rate of 35 breaths per minute, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The goal is to maintain peak pressures below 40 cmH2O. FiO2 is being weaned down as tolerated, and the patient is receiving vancomycin, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), considering his penicillin allergy. If the patient worsens, amikacin will be added.

The patient's hemodynamics are unstable, requiring heavy sedation and causing a drop in blood pressure. He was able to be weaned off vasopressin overnight, and the plan is to wean down on levophed as tolerated. The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which are likely due to PNA. Sputum culture has been resent, and pending cultures will be followed up on. Antibiotics will be continued as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was admitted with worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing dyspnea and increased oxygen requirement for the past few weeks. An echocardiogram revealed severe right ventricular (RV) dilation and moderate hypokinesis, as well as moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there is evidence of fever. Chest X-ray shows widespread bilateral pulmonary opacifications and tracheal enlargement. The patient's blood cultures are pending. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, rate of 35 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. He is also on antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), given his penicillin allergy. Other medications include N-acetylcysteine (NAC), vancomycin, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, fentanyl, norepinephrine, midazolam, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and respiratory failure indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. The presence of IPF and superimposed pneumonia may further compromise the patient's respiratory function.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient is currently"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's temperature has been elevated since 08:00 PM on [**2141-3-13**], reaching a peak of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Blood cultures were taken at 09:25 PM.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring higher FiO2 for some periods but now back down to 70%. Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) has been increased to 8 cmH2O, beyond which Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) rose to >40 cmH2O.

The patient's central venous oxygen saturation is 78%. An echocardiogram reveals severely dilated and moderately hypokinetic right ventricle with at least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The left ventricular function is normal. This finding is consistent with the prior study conducted on [**2141-3-10**], which showed mildly hypokinetic and moderately dilated right ventricle. However, upon review, it was determined to be severely dilated and moderately hypokinetic.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and an unknown allergy. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin at 08:04 PM on [**2141-3-13**], Aztreonam at 10:08 PM on [**2141-3-13**], and Ciprofloxacin at 12:08 AM on [**2141-3-14**].

The patient is currently receiving infusions of Fentanyl at 150 mcg/hour, Norepinephrine at 0.25 mcg/Kg/min, and Midazolam (Versed) at 12 mg/hour. Other medications include Midazolam (Versed) given at 03:21 PM on [**2141-3-13**], Fentanyl given at 06:43 PM on [**2141-3-13**], and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) given at 09:14 PM on [**2141-3-13**].

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted fever and respiratory symptoms. The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Maximum temperature: 38.8 degrees Celsius (101.8 degrees Fahrenheit)
- Current temperature: 36.4 degrees Celsius (97.6 degrees Fahrenheit)
- Heart rate: 91 beats per minute (range: 86-112 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 88/69 mmHg (with readings ranging from 79/51 mmHg to 176/171 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute (range: 17-36 bpm)
- Oxygen saturation: 99%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has persistent fevers, increased sputum volume, and an inability to improve ventilation or oxygenation. The patient's right ventricular function is compromised, and he is not expected to return to active status on the lung transplant list. He has been inactivated due to severe right ventricular compromise and inability to tolerate the procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is progressing, likely due to his underlying IPF. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in death if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has persistent fevers and increased sputum volume, indicating a significant infection. If not treated promptly and effectively, the infection can worsen, leading to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Right Ventricular Failure: The patient's severely dilated and moderately hypokinetic right ventricle suggests right ventricular failure. This can lead to decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and inadequate perfusion of vital organs.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. If a DVT forms, it can potentially dislodge and"
