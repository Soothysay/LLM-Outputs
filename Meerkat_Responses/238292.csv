   Assessment and Plan
   83yo male with multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) 5831**]
   multiforme was admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of
   pneumonia.
   .
   1. Multilobar opacities
   Patient's CXR is concerning for multilobar pneumonia. Etiology of his
   symptoms is broad given his history of immunosuppression. He is
   certainly at risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.
   - F/u final read of CXR, repeat CXR in AM
   - Induced sputum gram stain and culture including for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Send urine legionella Ag
   - Send Rapid viral screen
   - Send beta glucan and galactomannan
   - Start broad spectrum coverage with vancomycin, zosyn, and
   azithromycin.
   - Add LDH for concern for PCP and consider adding bactrim for LDH
   elevated.
   - O2 supplementation to maintain sats >95%
   .
   2. Sepsis
   Patient has evidence of sepsis given evidence of infection, fevers,
   hypotension, and tachycardia. His lactate initially mildly elevated in
   ED although normalized s/p IV fluids. Regarding source of infection,
   most likely source includes pulmonary given evidence of pneumonia on
   exam and imaging. No additional symptoms to suggest urinary or
   gastrointestinal infection. Given his immunosuppression while on
   current prolonged steroid taper, his differential diagnosis is broad.
   - Infectious work-up as above, follow up pending micro
   - Broad spectrum antibiotics for now
   - Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation to maintain MAP >60, could consider
   pressors if not responsive to fluid resuscitation or if altered mental
   status.
   - Consider whether pt may need stress dose steroids as on chronic
   steroids; can check AM cortisol
   - Recheck lactate in AM
   .
   3. HTN: Hypotensive on arrival to floor. [**Month (only) 11**] have component of
   hypovolemia given decreased fluid intake and high BUN:Cr ratio but
   given multilobar pneumonia, concerning for evolving sepsis.
   - Hold outpt Atenolol 75mg daily and Quinapril 20mg daily for now
   - IVF fluid boluses and management as above
   .
   4. Thrush: Likely [**3-12**] immunosuppression on dexamethasone taper
   - Continue Nystatin
   - Lidocaine prn for sore throat
   .
   5. GBM: Currently on prolonged dexamethasone taper [**3-12**] radiation with
   resultant edema in brainstem.
   - Continue current taper; on [**6-11**] decreased to 2mg once a day. On [**6-18**]
   decrease to 1mg once a day.
   - Continue Nystatin
   - Continue PPI given steroids, intracranial lesion
   .
   6. Hyperlipidemia: Stable, continue Atorvastatin.
   .
   7. CAD: As above, holding BP meds but continuing statin.
   .
   8. Osteoarthritis:
   - Resume chondroitin sulfate on discharge as not available inpatient
   - Ibuprofen prn for pain
   .
   9. Abdominal discomfort: Consistent with constipation per pt. Has not
   had BM in several days.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical problems who was admitted with fever and chest X-ray findings suggestive of pneumonia. The patient's condition has worsened, and he is now experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, and evidence of infection in the lungs. The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Multilobar pneumonia with overlying increased pulmonary edema/pleural effusion: The patient's chest X-ray shows multilobar opacities, indicating a severe form of pneumonia. This could lead to respiratory failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Sepsis: The patient has evidence of sepsis due to infection, fevers, hypotension, and tachycardia. Given his immunosuppressed state, the differential diagnosis for the source of infection is broad. If sepsis progresses, it can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to hypovolemia, fluid overload, or evolving sepsis. Maintaining adequate blood pressure is crucial to ensure organ perfusion.

4. Thrush: The patient likely has immunosuppression due to a prolonged dexamethasone taper. This increases the risk of developing thrush, which can be a significant infection in immunocompromised patients.

   had hypotension noted by VNA and to ED for evaluation.  There patient
   had findings consistent with pneumonia and possible pulmonary edema and
   in the setting of recent immunosupression patient treated with
   Vanco/Zosyn/Azithromycing and Bactrim and admitted to the ICU with
   sepsis secondary to pulmonary source.  This morning he has notable
   findings of persistent tachycardia and increasing O2 requirement.
   1)Sepsis-
   Vasopressin in place
   Given significant respiratory compromise would favor pressors over
   further fluid
   Will need central access for further pressors and, although it is clear
   patient has significant hydrostatic overload
   Outpatient anti-hypertensives held
   -Blood cultures sent and broad spectrum ABX in place
   2)Pneumonia-There remains a broad differential for infectious source
   and patient with significant tachypnea and hypoxemia
   Vanco/Bactrim/Azithro/Zosyn to continue
   Cultures all pending at this time
   Acute challenge is the significant pulmonary edema
   NIPPV may be required and if intubated bronch with BAL certainly would
   be reasonable

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of GBM, CAD, AS, and HTN. He was admitted with fever, cough, and fatigue, and found to have pneumonia and possible pulmonary edema. The patient is currently in the ICU with sepsis secondary to a pulmonary source. He is experiencing persistent tachycardia, increasing O2 requirement, and has a significant respiratory compromise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to a pulmonary source. He is already being treated with vasopressin, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and central access may be needed for further pressors.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and his treatment includes multiple antibiotics. Cultures are pending, and he may require non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or intubation with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient also has pulmonary edema, which is an acute challenge. Pressors rather than fluid will be given, and diuresis may not be pursued initially. NIPPV may be required if the patient's respiratory status worsens.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   Patient's CXR is concerning for multilobar pneumonia with overlying
   increased pulmonary edema/pleural effusion [**3-12**] aggressive fluid
   resusucitation overnight. Etiology of his symptoms is broad given his
   history of immunosuppression. He is certainly at risk for bacterial,
   viral, or fungal pathogens. Legionella negative
   -continue broad coverage with vanco and zosyn for HAP, azithromycin for
   atypicals, and bactrim for PCP

   -oxygen supplementation to maintain sats >95%
   -consider CT chest today to further evaluate
   2. Sepsis
   Patient has evidence of sepsis given evidence of infection, fevers,
   hypotension, and tachycardia. His lactate initially mildly elevated in
   ED. Regarding source of infection, most likely source is pulmonary
   given evidence of pneumonia on exam and imaging. No additional symptoms
   to suggest urinary or gastrointestinal infection. Given his
   immunosuppression while on current prolonged steroid taper, the
   differential diagnosis is broad.
   -broad spectrum antibiotics and infectious work-up as above, follow up
   pending micro
   -continue stress dose steroids
   -continue to trend lactate
   3. Blood pressure
   Hypotensive on arrival to floor. [**Month (only) 11**] have component of hypovolemia
   given decreased fluid intake and high BUN:Cr ratio but given multilobar
   pneumonia, concerning for evolving sepsis.  Patient was aggressively
   fluid resuscitated overnight but now limited by fluid overload.
   Maintaining MAPs at goal of 60.
   -holding outpatient atenolol 75mg daily and quinapril 20mg daily for
   now
   4. Thrush
   Likely [**3-12**] immunosuppression on dexamethasone taper.
   -continue Nystatin
   -lidocaine and cepacol prn for sore throat
   5. GBM
   Currently on prolonged dexamethasone taper [**3-12**] radiation with resultant
   edema in brainstem.
   -continue dexamethasone 6mg q12h
   -continue Nystatin
   -continue PPI given steroids, intracranial lesion
   6. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable, continue Atorvastatin.
   7. CAD
   As above, holding BP meds but continuing statin.
   8. Osteoarthritis
   -resume chondroitin sulfate on discharge as not available inpatient
   -ibuprofen prn for pain
   9. Abdominal discomfort: Consistent with constipation per pt. Has not
   had BM in several days.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, an 83-year-old man with multiple medical problems, was admitted to the ICU with fever and findings on a chest X-ray suggestive of pneumonia. The patient's condition is concerning for multilobar pneumonia with increased pulmonary edema/pleural effusion. He has been aggressively fluid resuscitated overnight but is now limited by fluid overload. The patient has a history of immunosuppression, putting him at risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. His etiology of symptoms is broad, and he has negative results for Legionella.

The patient is currently on broad coverage with vancomycin and zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia, azithromycin for atypical pathogens, and bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia. Additional tests, including induced sputum gram stain and culture, DFA, rapid viral screen, beta glucan, and galactomannan, are pending.

The patient also has evidence of sepsis, with infection, fevers, hypotension, and tachycardia. The source of infection is likely pulmonary due to the evidence of pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure is hypotensive, and there is a concern for evolving sepsis. Fluid resuscitation was provided but limited by fluid overload.

The patient has thrush, likely due to immunosuppression from a prolonged dexamethasone taper. Nystatin is being continued, and lidocaine"

   Patient's CXR is concerning for multilobar pneumonia with overlying
   increased pulmonary edema/pleural effusion [**3-12**] aggressive fluid
   resusucitation overnight. Etiology of his symptoms is broad given his
   history of immunosuppression. He is certainly at risk for bacterial,

   2. Sepsis
   Patient has evidence of sepsis given evidence of infection, fevers,
   hypotension, and tachycardia. His lactate initially mildly elevated in
   ED. Regarding source of infection, most likely source is pulmonary
   given evidence of pneumonia on exam and imaging. No additional symptoms
   to suggest urinary or gastrointestinal infection. Given his
   immunosuppression while on current prolonged steroid taper, the
   differential diagnosis is broad.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old man with multiple medical problems who was admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of pneumonia. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Multilobar pneumonia with overlying increased pulmonary edema/pleural effusion: The patient's CXR shows multilobar opacities, indicating the presence of pneumonia. The etiology of his symptoms is broad due to his history of immunosuppression, and he is at risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. Legionella has been ruled out.

2. Sepsis: The patient has evidence of sepsis, characterized by infection, fevers, hypotension, and tachycardia. The source of infection is likely pulmonary due to the evidence of pneumonia. His immunosuppression while on a prolonged steroid taper contributes to the broad differential diagnosis.

3. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive upon arrival to the floor, possibly due to hypovolemia and multilobar pneumonia. Aggressive fluid resuscitation was performed overnight, but now the patient is limited by fluid overload. Maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) at a goal of 60 is essential.

4. Thrush: The patient likely developed thrush due to immunosuppression on dexamethasone taper. Nystatin should be continued, and lidocaine and cepacol can"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly gentleman with multiple medical problems, including multiforme, admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of pneumonia. The patient's CXR shows multilobar opacities, concerning for multilobar pneumonia with overlying increased pulmonary edema/pleural effusion. The etiology of his symptoms is broad due to his history of immunosuppression, putting him at risk for bacterial, fungal, or Legionella pathogens. He has been treated with broad coverage antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia, azithromycin for atypical pathogens, and bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, likely due to sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He has evidence of infection, fevers, hypotension, and tachycardia. His lactate levels are mildly elevated. The source of infection appears to be pulmonary, but other possibilities such as urinary or gastrointestinal infections are being considered given his immunosuppressed state. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and an infectious work-up are ongoing.

The patient's blood pressure is also a concern, initially attributed to hypovolemia but now limited by fluid overload. He has been aggressively fluid-resuscitated overnight. His thrush is likely due to immunosuppression from a prolonged dexamethasone taper. He is currently on steroids for a GBM diagnosis and radiation"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly gentleman with multiple medical problems, including multiforme, admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of pneumonia. He is experiencing respiratory distress, infiltrates on CXR, and hypotension. The patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated but now limited by fluid overload. His lactate levels are elevated, indicating possible sepsis. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial, fungal, or Legionella pneumonia, as well as cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient is on a prolonged dexamethasone taper for GBM and radiation therapy. Other issues include thrush, hyperlipidemia, CAD, osteoarthritis, and abdominal discomfort. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, zosyn, azithromycin, bactrim, heparin sodium, and piperacillin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening pneumonia or cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
2. Sepsis due to bacterial or fungal infection, which may lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Hypotension and fluid overload, which can result in renal dysfunction or heart failure.
4. Thrush infection due to immunosuppression from dexamethasone taper.
5. Prolonged bed rest can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
6. Constipation and abdominal discomfort may lead to bowel obstruction or perforation.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo man with multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) 5831**]
   multiforme was admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of
   pneumonia.
   1. Multilobar opacities
   Patient's CXR is concerning for multilobar pneumonia with overlying
   increased pulmonary edema/pleural effusion [**3-12**] aggressive fluid
   resusucitation overnight. Etiology of his symptoms is broad given his
   history of immunosuppression. He is certainly at risk for bacterial,
   viral, or fungal pathogens. Legionella negative
   -continue broad coverage with vanco and zosyn for HAP, azithromycin for
   atypicals, and bactrim for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u induced sputum gram stain and culture including for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   DFA, rapid viral screen, beta glucan and galactomannan
   -f/u CMV vL
   -oxygen supplementation to maintain sats >95%
   -consider CT chest today to further evaluate
   2. Sepsis
   Patient has evidence of sepsis given evidence of infection, fevers,
   hypotension, and tachycardia. His lactate initially mildly elevated in
   ED. Regarding source of infection, most likely source is pulmonary
   given evidence of pneumonia on exam and imaging. No additional symptoms
   to suggest urinary or gastrointestinal infection. Given his
   immunosuppression while on current prolonged steroid taper, the
   differential diagnosis is broad.
   -broad spectrum antibiotics and infectious work-up as above, follow up
   pending micro
   -continue stress dose steroids
   -continue to trend lactate
   3. Blood pressure
   Hypotensive on arrival to floor. [**Month (only) 11**] have component of hypovolemia
   given decreased fluid intake and high BUN:Cr ratio but given multilobar
   pneumonia, concerning for evolving sepsis.  Patient was aggressively
   fluid resuscitated overnight but now limited by fluid overload.
   Maintaining MAPs at goal of 60.
   -holding outpatient atenolol 75mg daily and quinapril 20mg daily for
   now
   4. Thrush
   Likely [**3-12**] immunosuppression on dexamethasone taper.
   -continue Nystatin
   -lidocaine and cepacol prn for sore throat
   5. GBM
   Currently on prolonged dexamethasone taper [**3-12**] radiation with resultant
   edema in brainstem.
   -continue dexamethasone 6mg q12h
   -continue Nystatin
   -continue PPI given steroids, intracranial lesion
   6. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable, continue Atorvastatin.
   7. CAD
   As above, holding BP meds but continuing statin.
   8. Osteoarthritis
   -resume chondroitin sulfate on discharge as not available inpatient
   -ibuprofen prn for pain
   9. Abdominal discomfort: Consistent with constipation per pt. Has not
   had BM in several days.

","The patient is an 83-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including multiforme, who was admitted with fever and findings on chest X-ray suggestive of pneumonia. The patient has been aggressively fluid resuscitated overnight but is now limited by fluid overload. He is hypotensive and tachycardic, indicating possible sepsis, and has evidence of infection, fevers, and hypotension. The most likely source of infection is pulmonary due to evidence of pneumonia on exam and imaging. 

The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management. He has several potential complications that need to be addressed:

1. Multilobar opacities on chest X-ray: This suggests multilobar pneumonia with overlying increased pulmonary edema/pleural effusion. The patient requires aggressive treatment for pneumonia, including broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Sepsis: The patient has evidence of sepsis given his infection, fevers, hypotension, and tachycardia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and an infectious work-up should be done.

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive on arrival to the floor, which may be due to hypovolemia or evolving sepsis. Fluid resuscitation should be continued to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at goal of 60.

4. Thrush: The patient likely has immunosuppression due to dexamethasone taper, which increases the risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male admitted wtih fever and pneumonia suggested who has evolved
   significant hypoxemia, worsening of pulmonary infiltrate and has had
   progression of hypoxemia across time wtih respiratory alkalosis.  This
   may well be ongoing infection but certainly given the nature of
   infiltrates he has concern raised for possible hydrostatic pulmonary
   edema contribution and possible AS.  This potential issue of severe AS
   contributing would make move to intubation one that would have to be
   conducted carefully and precisely.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Hypoxemic--Differential diagnosis as above
   -Intubation needed to allow ongoing evaluation and treatment going
   forward as patient with severe respiratory compromise and distress.
   -Bronch with BAL for possible PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 5855**] continue with empiric Rx-Vanco/bactrim-400mg IV q 8 hours/Zosyn
   -Dex 6mg q 12 ongoing for multiple reasons and will consider some
   benefit in terms of possible PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 5855**] pursue ECHO results as will have to consider AS as potentially
   severe and will need to manage volume status and pressor requirements
   around intubation with care
   -Plan and need for intubation described in full with patient.
   2)HYPOTENSION-Possible sepsis or cardiogenic-
   -Will continue with broad spectrum ABX
   -Will need CVL to consider possible cardiogenic source in failure

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male admitted with fever and pneumonia who has developed significant hypoxemia and worsening pulmonary infiltrates. The patient's condition suggests ongoing infection and raises concerns for possible hydrostatic pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure-Hypoxemic: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia may progress to severe respiratory failure, which may necessitate intubation to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. The differential diagnosis includes ongoing infection (such as pneumonia or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), hydrostatic pulmonary edema, and ARDS. Intubation would allow for ongoing evaluation and treatment.

2. HYPOTENSION-Possible sepsis or cardiogenic: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to sepsis secondary to infection or cardiogenic causes. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued, and a central venous line may be placed to evaluate for a possible cardiogenic source of the hypotension. Vasopressin will be continued for now.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status and hemodynamics, administer appropriate antibiotics, and consider interventions such as intubation and central venous access to manage the patient's condition effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo man with multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) 5831**]
   multiforme was admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of
   pneumonia.
   1. Respiratory failure:
   Infiltrates concerning for pneumonia and given immuosuppression, at
   risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. Legionella negative.
   Evolving CXR concerning for hydrostatic pulmonary edema which may be
   [**3-12**] aggressive fluid resuscitation in setting of hypotension. Appears
   noncardiogenic given ROMI and nl ventricular function on TTE. Not able
   to tolerate AC due to dysynchrony; improved with pressure control but
   still pulling in large Vt.
   -Continue ventilation
   -Continue broad coverage with vanco and zosyn for HAP, azithromycin for
   atypicals, and bactrim for PCP

   -Per ID curbside, CMV unlikely to be etiology as not very
   immunosuppressed; would not treat at this time
   -Consider CT chest if continuing to worsen
   2. Hypotension
   Likely septic given evidence of infection with contribution from
   sedation and positive pressure ventilation. Initially may have had
   component of hypovolemia given decreased fluid intake and high BUN:Cr
   ratio but aggressively fluid repleted with improvement in lactate. Also
   may have had adrenal insufficiency given acute insult in setting of
   chronic steroids but started on stress dose steroids. Cardiogenic
   etiology less likely given absence of AS or ventricular dysfunction on
   TTE.  His lactate increased again today; maintain MAPs > 65 on
   pressors.
   -Broad spectrum antibiotics and infectious work-up as above
   -Continue stress dose steroids
   -Continue pressors for now, wean as tolerated
   -[**Month (only) 11**] be able to tolerate small fluid boluses if needed
   -Repeat lactate in PM
   -Continue to hold outpatient atenolol and quinapril
   3. Thrush
   Likely [**3-12**] immunosuppression on dexamethasone taper.
   -continue Nystatin
   -lidocaine and cepacol prn for sore throat when taking po
   4. GBM
   Currently on prolonged dexamethasone taper [**3-12**] radiation with resultant
   edema in brainstem.
   -continue dexamethasone 6mg q12h
   -continue PPI given steroids, intracranial lesion
   -continue Nystatin
   5. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable, continue Atorvastatin.
   6. CAD
   As above, holding BP meds but continuing statin.
   7. Osteoarthritis
   -resume chondroitin sulfate on discharge as not available inpatient

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 83-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including multiforme. He was admitted with fever and chest X-ray findings suggestive of pneumonia. He has been intubated for hypoxia, infection, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Initially, he was ventilated on assist control but switched to pressure control due to dysynchrony. Levophed was started for hypotension likely due to sepsis given preserved cardiac function. An arterial line was placed for monitoring of BP and frequent ABGs. Sedation was increased this morning for increased dysynchrony. Levophed was uptitrated in this setting.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/78 mmHg to 143/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91%, and sinus tachycardia as the heart rhythm.

The patient's lab results show leukocyte count of 7.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, glucose level of 270 mg/dL, sodium level of 134 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.04. The TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF > 55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen, along with mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is noted, as well as a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, hypotension, thrush, GBM (likely referring to a condition related to the central nervous system), hyperlipidemia, CAD (coronary artery disease), osteoarthritis, abdominal discomfort, and ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may continue to experience difficulty breathing and may require further intervention.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure may remain low, leading to potential complications such as organ perfusion issues.
3. Thrush: The patient's immunosuppression increases the risk of fungal infections like thrush. It will need to be managed with appropriate antifungal treatment.
4. GBM: The patient's prolonged dexamethasone taper and radiation treatment indicate a possible GBM (glioblastoma multiforme). Close monitoring and management of symptoms associated with GBM are necessary.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including multiforme, admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of pneumonia. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to respiratory distress and multilobar pneumonia with increased pulmonary edema/pleural effusion. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress indicates a potential complication related to his pneumonia. The combination of hypoxia and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema suggests acute respiratory failure, which may require further intervention such as tracheostomy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels indicate sepsis. The source of infection is likely pulmonary due to evidence of pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and an infectious work-up should be done to identify the causative organism.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient's aggressive fluid resuscitation has led to fluid overload, as indicated by the high fluid intake and low urine output. Close monitoring of fluid balance is necessary to prevent further fluid overload and associated complications like acute kidney injury.

4. Thrush: The patient has developed thrush, likely due to immunosuppression from the prolonged dexamethasone taper. Treatment with nystatin should continue, and measures should"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including multiforme, admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of pneumonia. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, infiltrates on CXR, and has received aggressive fluid resuscitation overnight. The etiology of his symptoms is broad given his history of immunosuppression, and he is at risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. The patient's CXR is concerning for multilobar pneumonia with overlying increased pulmonary edema/pleural effusion. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress, infiltrates on CXR: The patient's respiratory symptoms and CXR findings suggest pneumonia. The etiology of his symptoms is broad due to his immunosuppressed state.
2. Hypotension: The patient has evidence of sepsis, with infection, fevers, hypotension, and tachycardia. The source of infection is likely pulmonary given the evidence of pneumonia on exam and imaging.
3. Blood pressure: The patient is hypotensive on arrival to the floor, which may be due to hypovolemia or evolving sepsis. Aggressive fluid resuscitation has been provided, but fluid overload is now a concern.
4. Thrush: The patient has developed thrush likely due to immunosuppression on dexamethasone taper.
5. GBM: The patient is currently on a prolonged dexamethasone"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted with fever and pneumonia, who has developed significant hypoxemia, worsening pulmonary infiltrate, and progression of hypoxemia over time. The patient is critically ill with acute respiratory failure - hypoxemic, and there is a concern for possible hydrostatic pulmonary edema. The patient also has septic shock likely exacerbated by sedation and positive pressure ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure - hypoxemic: The patient's worsening pulmonary infiltrate and hypoxemia suggest the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Septic shock: The patient's presentation of fever, pneumonia, and hypotension suggests an ongoing infection leading to septic shock. This condition is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation.
3. Thrush: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing oral thrush, which can be treated with antifungal medication such as nystatin.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures like low molecular weight heparin should be initiated to prevent this complication.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo man with multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) 5831**]
   multiforme was admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of
   pneumonia.
   1. Respiratory failure:
   Infiltrates concerning for pneumonia and given immuosuppression, at
   risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. Legionella negative.
   Evolving CXR concerning for hydrostatic pulmonary edema which may be
   [**3-12**] aggressive fluid resuscitation in setting of hypotension.  Appears
   noncardiogenic given ROMI and nl ventricular function on TTE. Not able
   to tolerate AC due to dysynchrony; improved with pressure control but
   still pulling in large Vt. BAL without micro yet.
   -F/u BAL.
   -Continue ventilation
   -Continue broad coverage with vanco and zosyn for HAP, azithromycin for
   atypicals, and [**Month/Day (2) **] for PCP
   [**Month (only) 5887**] have benefit from stress dose steroids in setting of possible PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] ID [**Name9 (PRE) 5899**], CMV unlikely to be etiology as not very
   immunosuppressed; would not treat at this time
   -Consider CT chest if continuing to worsen
   2. Hypotension
   Likely septic given evidence of infection with contribution from
   sedation and positive pressure ventilation. Initially may have had
   component of hypovolemia given decreased fluid intake and high BUN:Cr
   ratio but aggressively fluid repleted with improvement in lactate. Also
   may have had adrenal insufficiency given acute insult in setting of
   chronic steroids but started on stress dose steroids. Cardiogenic
   etiology less likely given absence of AS or ventricular dysfunction on
   TTE.  His lactate increased again today; maintain MAPs > 65 on
   pressors.
   -Broad spectrum antibiotics and infectious work-up as above
   -Continue stress dose steroids
   -Continue pressors for now, wean as tolerated
   -[**Month (only) 11**] be able to tolerate small fluid boluses if needed
   -Repeat lactate in PM
   -Continue to hold outpatient atenolol and quinapril
   3. Thrush
   Likely [**3-12**] immunosuppression on dexamethasone taper.
   -continue Nystatin
   -lidocaine and cepacol prn for sore throat when taking po
   4. GBM

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including multiforme, who was admitted with fever and chest X-ray findings suggestive of pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is intubated, sedated, and not arousable to voice.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is at risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. Legionella negative. The chest X-ray initially showed infiltrates concerning for pneumonia and evolved into findings suggestive of hydrostatic pulmonary edema, which may be noncardiogenic given ROMI and normal ventricular function on trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient is unable to tolerate assisted coughing due to dysynchrony and has improved with pressure control ventilation but still pulls in large tidal volumes. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) without microorganisms has been performed.

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with continued ventilation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia, azithromycin for atypical pathogens, and [**Month/Day (2) **] for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Stress dose steroids have been initiated, considering possible PCP.

The patient's hypotension is likely septic given evidence of infection with contribution from sedation and positive pressure ventilation. Initially, there may have been a component of hyp"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo man with multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) 5831**]
   multiforme was admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of
   pneumonia.
   1. Respiratory failure:
   Infiltrates concerning for pneumonia and given immuosuppression, at
   risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. Legionella negative.
   Evolving CXR concerning for hydrostatic pulmonary edema which may be
   [**3-12**] aggressive fluid resuscitation in setting of hypotension. Appears
   noncardiogenic given ROMI and nl ventricular function on TTE. Not able
   to tolerate AC due to dysynchrony; improved with pressure control but
   still pulling in large Vt.
   -Continue ventilation
   -Continue broad coverage with vanco and zosyn for HAP, azithromycin for
   atypicals, and bactrim for PCP
   [**Month (only) 5887**] have benefit from stress dose steroids in setting of possible PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 5888**] BAL today for micro
   -Per ID curbside, CMV unlikely to be etiology as not very
   immunosuppressed; would not treat at this time
   -Consider CT chest if continuing to worsen
   2. Hypotension
   Likely septic given evidence of infection with contribution from
   sedation and positive pressure ventilation. Initially may have had
   component of hypovolemia given decreased fluid intake and high BUN:Cr
   ratio but aggressively fluid repleted with improvement in lactate. Also
   may have had adrenal insufficiency given acute insult in setting of
   chronic steroids but started on stress dose steroids. Cardiogenic
   etiology less likely given absence of AS or ventricular dysfunction on
   TTE.  His lactate increased again today; maintain MAPs > 65 on
   pressors.
   -Broad spectrum antibiotics and infectious work-up as above
   -Continue stress dose steroids
   -Continue pressors for now, wean as tolerated
   -[**Month (only) 11**] be able to tolerate small fluid boluses if needed
   -Repeat lactate in PM
   -Continue to hold outpatient atenolol and quinapril
   3. Thrush
   Likely [**3-12**] immunosuppression on dexamethasone taper.
   -continue Nystatin
   -lidocaine and cepacol prn for sore throat when taking po
   4. GBM
   Currently on prolonged dexamethasone taper [**3-12**] radiation with resultant
   edema in brainstem.
   -continue dexamethasone 6mg q12h
   -continue PPI given steroids, intracranial lesion
   -continue Nystatin
   5. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable, continue Atorvastatin.
   6. CAD
   As above, holding BP meds but continuing statin.
   7. Osteoarthritis
   -resume chondroitin sulfate on discharge as not available inpatient
   -ibuprofen prn for pain
   9. Abdominal discomfort: Consistent with constipation per pt. Had BM

   Disposition: ICU pending improvement in BP and respiratory status
","The patient is an elderly gentleman with multiple medical problems, including multiforme, admitted with fever and chest X-ray findings suggestive of pneumonia. He is intubated and sedated, not arousable to voice. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, hypotension, thrush, GBM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, osteoarthritis, and abdominal discomfort.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and evolving chest X-ray findings concerning for hydrostatic pulmonary edema put him at risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. Legionella negative. This indicates a possibility of worsening respiratory failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely septic given evidence of infection with contribution from sedation and positive pressure ventilation. This suggests a risk of further sepsis and organ dysfunction.

3. Thrush: The patient's immunosuppression on dexamethasone taper increases the likelihood of thrush. If not treated, it may lead to an infection.

4. GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme): The patient's prolonged dexamethasone taper and radiation treatment for GBM may result in brainstem edema. This can cause neurological complications and worsen the patient's overall condition.

5. Hyperlipidemia: Although stable, the patient's hyperlipidemia needs to be managed appropriately to reduce cardiovascular risk.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo man with multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) 5831**]
   multiforme was admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of
   pneumonia.
   1. Respiratory failure:
   Infiltrates concerning for pneumonia and given immuosuppression, at
   risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. Legionella negative.
   Evolving CXR concerning for hydrostatic pulmonary edema which may be
   [**3-12**] aggressive fluid resuscitation in setting of hypotension.  Appears
   noncardiogenic given ROMI and nl ventricular function on TTE. Not able
   to tolerate AC due to dysynchrony; improved with pressure control but
   still pulling in large Vt. BAL without micro yet.
   -F/u BAL.
   -Continue ventilation
   -Continue broad coverage with vanco and zosyn for HAP, azithromycin for
   atypicals, and bactrim for PCP
   [**Month (only) 5887**] have benefit from stress dose steroids in setting of possible PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] ID [**Name9 (PRE) 5899**], CMV unlikely to be etiology as not very
   immunosuppressed; would not treat at this time
   -Consider CT chest if continuing to worsen
   2. Hypotension
   Likely septic given evidence of infection with contribution from
   sedation and positive pressure ventilation. Initially may have had
   component of hypovolemia given decreased fluid intake and high BUN:Cr
   ratio but aggressively fluid repleted with improvement in lactate. Also
   may have had adrenal insufficiency given acute insult in setting of
   chronic steroids but started on stress dose steroids. Cardiogenic
   etiology less likely given absence of AS or ventricular dysfunction on
   TTE.  His lactate increased again today; maintain MAPs > 65 on
   pressors.
   -Broad spectrum antibiotics and infectious work-up as above
   -Continue stress dose steroids
   -Continue pressors for now, wean as tolerated
   -[**Month (only) 11**] be able to tolerate small fluid boluses if needed
   -Repeat lactate in PM
   -Continue to hold outpatient atenolol and quinapril
   3. Thrush
   Likely [**3-12**] immunosuppression on dexamethasone taper.
   -continue Nystatin
   -lidocaine and cepacol prn for sore throat when taking po
   4. GBM
   Currently on prolonged dexamethasone taper [**3-12**] radiation with resultant
   edema in brainstem.
   -continue dexamethasone 6mg q12h
   -continue PPI given steroids, intracranial lesion
   -continue Nystatin
   5. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable, continue Atorvastatin.
   6. CAD
   As above, holding BP meds but continuing statin.
   7. Osteoarthritis
   -resume chondroitin sulfate on discharge as not available inpatient
   -ibuprofen prn for pain
   9. Abdominal discomfort: Consistent with constipation per pt. Had BM
   yesterday but still quiet bowel sounds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including multiforme, who was admitted with fever and chest X-ray findings suggestive of pneumonia. He is intubated and sedated, not arousable to voice. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being treated for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. His respiratory failure is evolving, with infiltrates concerning for pneumonia and signs of hydrostatic pulmonary edema. He is also at risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens, and Legionella has been ruled out.

The patient's hypotension is likely septic, possibly due to infection and positive pressure ventilation. He has been aggressively fluid-repleted, and his lactate has improved. There may have been a component of hypovolemia initially, but this has been addressed. Cardiogenic etiology is less likely given the absence of aortic stenosis or ventricular dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The patient is receiving stress dose steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and continues to require pressors to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 65.

The patient has thrush, likely due to immunosuppression from dexamethasone taper. He is being treated with nystatin and may require lidocaine and cepacol for a sore throat when taking oral medications. He is currently on a prolonged dexamethasone taper and radiation, resulting in"

","The patient is an 83-year-old man with multiple medical problems, including multiforme, admitted with fever and chest X-ray findings suggestive of pneumonia. He has respiratory failure due to infiltrates concerning for pneumonia and is at risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. The patient has a positive result for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) infection. There are also concerns about hydrostatic pulmonary edema, which may be due to aggressive fluid resuscitation in the setting of hypotension. The patient is unable to tolerate assisted coughing due to dysynchrony and has been improving with pressure control ventilation but still pulling in large tidal volumes. The patient's blood cultures have shown no growth, and imaging shows no significant changes since the previous day.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 104 bpm (102-124), blood pressure of 111/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 490 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 240, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 17 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.9 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 24.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 119 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 25.6 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose of 78 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 3.9 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) of 111 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 103 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 6.9 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphorus (PO4) of 1.7 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes multiforme, osteoarthritis, coronary artery disease (CAD), hyperlipidemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GBM). The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, stress dose steroids for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), antifungal therapy, and antiviral prophylaxis. The patient is also being treated for thrush with Nystatin and receiving a statin for hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), stress ulcer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pressure ulcers."

   tolerate AC due to dysynchrony; currently on pressure control.
   Desating with position changes implies PEEP dependence.
   -F/u final BAL.

   #. Hypotension:
   Likely septic given evidence of infection with contribution from
   sedation and positive pressure ventilation. Initially may have had
   component of hypovolemia given decreased fluid intake and high BUN:Cr
   ratio but aggressively fluid repleted with improvement in lactate. Also
   may have had adrenal insufficiency given acute insult in setting of
   chronic steroids, so started on stress dose steroids. Cardiogenic
   etiology less likely given relatively normal [**Name (NI) **].  Lactate increased to
   3 from 2.6; maintain MAPs > 65 on pressors.
   -Bactrim for PCP as above

   -trend lactate
   -Continue to hold outpatient atenolol and quinapril

   # Low urine output/ hyponatremia: likely from intravascular depletion
   despite total body fluid overload. Adrenal insufficiency could also be
   contributing.  Hyponatremia could also be secondary to bactrim or
   SIADH: Urine lytes, Osms ordered. Trial of 1L NS given.
   - s/p 1 L fluid bolus this AM: Na rose to 132 from 130, although a very

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old man with glioblastoma multiforme who developed PCP pneumonia while on a steroid taper. He required intubation due to progressive hypoxemia and is currently on levophed and stress dose steroids. The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure/PCP pneumonia, hypotension, low urine output/hyponatremia, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), thrush, and coronary artery disease (CAD).

Respiratory Failure/PCP Pneumonia:
The patient has respiratory failure likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with pulmonary edema possibly contributing after aggressive fluid resuscitation. Normal ventricular function is noted, but the patient cannot tolerate assisted ventilation due to dysynchrony and is currently on pressure control. Decreasing FiO2 to 40% and keeping PEEP at 8 is recommended.

Hypotension:
The patient likely has septic hypotension given evidence of infection with a contribution from sedation and positive pressure ventilation. Initially, there may have been a component of hypovolemia due to decreased fluid intake and high BUN:Cr ratio, but aggressive fluid resuscitation has improved the lactate levels. The possibility of adrenal insufficiency is also considered, especially in the setting of chronic steroids, so stress dose steroids have been started. Maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) > 65 on pressors.

Low Urine Output/Hyponatremia:
The patient's low urine output and hyponatremia are likely from intravascular depletion despite total body fluid overload. Adrenal insufficiency could also be contributing, along with possible side effects of bactrim or SIADH. Urine lytes and Osmos have been ordered, and a trial of 1L NS has been given. 

GBM:
The patient has glioblastoma multiforme, previously treated with prolonged dexamethasone taper and radiation with resultant edema in the brainstem. Now, the patient is on stress dose steroids.

Thrush:
The patient likely has thrush due to prolonged immunosuppression from steroids. Nystatin should be continued.

CAD:
The patient has coronary artery disease (CAD), and blood pressure medications are being held. Statin therapy will be continued, and ASA 81 has been started.

ICU Care:
Nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP should be managed accordingly.

Please note that the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo man with multiple medical problems including [**Name2 (NI) 5831**]
   multiforme was admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of
   pneumonia.
   1. Respiratory failure:
   Infiltrates concerning for pneumonia and given immuosuppression, at
   risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. BAL grew PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] negative. Evolving CXR concerning for hydrostatic pulmonary
   edema which may be [**3-12**] aggressive fluid resuscitation in setting of
   hypotension.  Appears noncardiogenic given ROMI and nl ventricular
   function on TTE. Not able to tolerate AC due to dysynchrony; improved
   with pressure control but still pulling in large Vt. BAL without micro
   yet.
   -F/u final BAL.
   -Continue ventilation
   -Continue broad coverage with vanco and zosyn for HAP, azithromycin for
   atypicals, and bactrim for PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 5911**] stress dose steroids for PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] ID [**Name9 (PRE) 5899**], CMV unlikely to be etiology as not very
   immunosuppressed; would not treat at this time
   -Consider CT chest if continuing to worsen
   2. Hypotension
   Likely septic given evidence of infection with contribution from
   sedation and positive pressure ventilation. Initially may have had
   component of hypovolemia given decreased fluid intake and high BUN:Cr
   ratio but aggressively fluid repleted with improvement in lactate. Also
   may have had adrenal insufficiency given acute insult in setting of
   chronic steroids but started on stress dose steroids. Cardiogenic
   etiology less likely given absence of AS or ventricular dysfunction on
   TTE.  Lactate increased TO 3 from 2.6; maintain MAPs > 65 on pressors.
   -Broad spectrum antibiotics and infectious work-up as above
   -Continue stress dose steroids
   -Continue pressors for now, wean as tolerated
   -[**Month (only) 11**] be able to tolerate small fluid boluses if needed
   -Repeat lactate in PM
   -Continue to hold outpatient atenolol and quinapril
   3. Thrush
   Likely [**3-12**] immunosuppression on dexamethasone taper.
   -continue Nystatin
   -lidocaine and cepacol prn for sore throat when taking po
   4. GBM
   Previously on prolonged dexamethasone taper [**3-12**] radiation with
   resultant edema in brainstem.
   -now on stress dose steroids
   -continue PPI given steroids, intracranial lesion
   -continue Nystatin
   5. Hyperlipidemia
   Stable, continue Atorvastatin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical problems including multiforme, admitted with fever and CXR findings suggestive of pneumonia. He has respiratory failure due to infiltrates concerning for pneumonia and immunosuppression, at risk for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. BAL grew PCP, and the patient is negative for other infections. His evolving CXR is concerning for hydrostatic pulmonary edema, which may be noncardiogenic given ROMI and normal ventricular function on TTE. He was unable to tolerate AC due to dysynchrony but improved with pressure control ventilation but still pulling in large Vt. The final BAL results are pending.

The patient is also hypotensive, likely septic given evidence of infection with contribution from sedation and positive pressure ventilation. He has been aggressively fluid repleted with improvement in lactate. There may have been a component of hypovolemia given decreased fluid intake and high BUN:Cr ratio, but this has been addressed. The patient may also have had adrenal insufficiency given acute insult in the setting of chronic steroids, but stress dose steroids have been started. Cardiogenic etiology is less likely given absence of AS or ventricular dysfunction on TTE. Broad-spectrum antibiotics and an infectious work-up have been initiated as above. Stress dose steroids will be continued, and pressors will be maintained for now, weaning as tolerated.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including multiforme, admitted with fever and chest X-ray findings suggestive of pneumonia. He is currently on prolonged dexamethasone taper and has a history of prolonged radiation treatment with resultant brainstem edema. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. He is also experiencing hypotension, likely due to sepsis secondary to infection. The patient has thrush, which is likely due to immunosuppression from dexamethasone taper. He also has hyperlipidemia, CAD, osteoarthritis, and abdominal discomfort consistent with constipation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/63 mmHg to 90/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and low albumin. Imaging studies reveal a positive immunofluorescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii). The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), azithromycin, bactrim, norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may progress if he is unable to tolerate weaning off the ventilator or if there are further complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. If the infection is not effectively controlled, it can lead to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

3. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): The positive immunofluorescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii indicates a high risk for PCP. If left untreated, PCP can progress to respiratory failure and may require treatment with additional medications.

4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal discomfort and history of long-term steroid use increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. If this occurs, it can lead to hypotension and further complications.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and hospitalization increase the risk of DVT. If a DVT occurs, it can lead to pulmonary embolism, which is a life-threatening condition.

6. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay, he is at an increased risk"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) secondary to oversedation. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving various medications and treatments.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/63 mmHg to 90/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on endotracheal ventilation with PEEP at 8 cmH2O and FiO2 at 50%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates an arterial line and a PICC line in place. The fluid balance shows an intake of 3,133 mL and output of 2,705 mL, with a negative balance of -887 mL. The patient has received a small fluid bolus but overall urine output is okay, so further bolus was held.

The respiratory support shows the patient on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 490 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 22 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 240, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 11.5 L/min. The patient's SpO2 remains stable at 95%.

The physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's sedation and inability to assess peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic status, and other systems. The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, as well as low albumin, potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels. The blood cultures are negative for growth, but the immunofluorescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii) is positive.

The patient's medical history includes cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the brain, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension (not in shock), hypoxemia, sepsis with organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and alteration in nutrition. The patient has been on various medications including norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and stress dose steroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), ICU-acquired infections, and the possibility of further deterioration in organ function."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of GBM on steroid taper at home. He was admitted with fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency in the setting of PCP.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has anasarca, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and impaired skin integrity.
2. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially worsen if not managed appropriately.
3. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's altered nutritional status may contribute to poor wound healing, impaired immune function, and overall poor outcomes.
4. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), brain: The patient's history of GBM (brain cancer) increases the risk of complications related to the underlying malignancy, such as increased susceptibility to infections and impaired immune response.
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient is diagnosed with ARDS, which can result in severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
6. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's low blood pressure may be due to septic shock, adrenal insufficiency, or other factors. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's hemodynamic status closely.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) on steroid taper at home. He was admitted with fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, and sepsis in the setting of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient has a positive DFA for PCP on BAL (Bronchoalveolar Lavage). Stress dose steroids were started for low random cortisol.

Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's lungs are very peep dependent with positional decompensation. It is recommended to continue ARDS net vent support with PCP [Name Initial (PRE)]. The current PEEP should be continued at 8, and FiO2 should be decreased to 40% following ABG (Arterial Blood Gas).
2. Septic Shock: The patient is in septic shock with hypotension further exacerbated by sedation and positive pressure ventilation. Supportive care should be continued, including stress dose steroids and weaning pressors for MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) > 60.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has multiple reasons for SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion), including CNS process (GBM), lung process, adrenal insufficiency, and potential effects of Bactrim. Serum and urine electroly"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted with fever and pneumonia, likely due to PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient's condition has progressed to acute respiratory failure/PCP pneumonia, requiring intubation. The patient is also experiencing septic shock, likely exacerbated by sedation and positive pressure ventilation, as well as adrenal insufficiency. There is concern for SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone) given the patient's GBM/lung process and adrenal issues. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 97/52 mmHg, and hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 85%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of PCV+, FiO2 set at 50%, PEEP at 8 cmH2O, and respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 125 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 119 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 125 mEq/L. Imaging shows bilateral interstitial lung pattern.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) on steroid taper at home. He was admitted with fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency in the setting of PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia).

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) due to PCP, which is causing severe hypoxemia. The plan is to continue ARDS net vent support, decrease FiO2 to 40%, and assess ABG results. The patient's lungs are peep-dependent and may show positional decompression.

2. Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock with hypotension exacerbated by sedation, positive pressure ventilation, and adrenal insufficiency. Supportive care, including antibiotics and stress dose steroids, should be continued. Pressors should be weaned for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia with multiple factors contributing to it, such as CNS process (GBM), lung process, adrenal insufficiency, and potential effects of Bactrim. Serum and urine electrolytes and osmolality should be checked, and the patient should be followed according to the hospital's sodium"

   SIADH: Urine lytes, Osms ordered. Trial of 1L NS given.
   - s/p 1 L fluid bolus this AM: Na rose to 132 from 130, although a very

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of glioblastoma multiforme who developed pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) while on steroid treatment. He was intubated due to progressive hypoxemia and is currently on levophed and stress dose steroids. The patient has respiratory failure likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with pulmonary edema, and he is dependent on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). His blood pressure is low, possibly due to sepsis and positive pressure ventilation. He also has hyponatremia, likely from intravascular depletion or adrenal insufficiency. The patient has a history of cancer, brain malignancy, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated lactate levels suggest sepsis, which could progress to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly.
3. Thrush: The patient's prolonged steroid use has likely caused immunosuppression, increasing the risk of developing oral thrush. This condition can be treated with antifungal medications like Nystatin.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels may lead to neurological complications if not corrected appropriately."

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of renal function leading to acute kidney injury, progression of GBM, and possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, fluid balance, renal function, and neurologic status. Regular reassessment and prompt management of any new or worsening symptoms are crucial in this case."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of GBM on steroid taper at home. He was admitted with fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on mechanical ventilation with PRVC mode. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 106/46 mmHg and heart rate of 85 bpm. The patient's oxygen saturation is 90% on FiO2 50%. His temperature is slightly elevated at 36.8°C.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no edema, and distant breath sounds bilaterally. Peripheral pulses are diminished on both arms and legs. The patient has a history of cancer, brain, and is on steroid taper. The lab results show hyponatremia, leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and renal dysfunction.

Assessment and plan:
1. Impaired skin integrity
2. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction)
3. Alteration in nutrition
4. H/O cancer (malignant neoplasm), brain
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, acute lung injury)
6. Hypotension (not in shock)
7. Hypoxemia

The patient's condition is critical, and he requires continued ventilatory support. The ARDS net volumes should be adjusted to improve alkalosis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of GBM on steroid taper at home. He was admitted with fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient has several medical complications including impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, alteration in nutrition, malignant neoplasm (brain), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's cool, distal extremities and impaired peripheral pulses may indicate compromised blood circulation, which can lead to skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
2. Severe Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient's presentation of fever, pulmonary infiltrates, and sepsis indicates a systemic infection that has progressed to severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. This can result in organ failure and potentially be life-threatening.
3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's altered nutritional status may be due to decreased oral intake, impaired absorption, or malabsorption. This can lead to malnutrition and compromised immune function.
4. Malignant Neoplasm (Brain): The patient's history of GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) indicates a malignant brain tumor. This can cause neurological symptoms, increased intracranial pressure, and seizures.
5. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's"

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), brain glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), currently admitted to the ICU. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a high tidal volume and high oxygen requirements. He has been receiving various medications, including dexamethasone, fentanyl, midazolam, lansoprazole, furosemide, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, slightly elevated heart rate, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 132. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,962 mL and output of 2,040 mL, with a positive balance of 922 mL. The patient's labs reveal elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal limits. The patient's imaging shows a poor chest X-ray study, likely unchanged. The patient is diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, alteration in nutrition, malignant neoplasm, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension, and hypoxemia. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutritional support and prophylactic measures such as DVT and stress ulcer prevention. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) who was admitted with fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient had been on a steroid taper at home and developed PCP pneumonia. He required intubation on [6-16] due to progressive hypoxemia. The patient is currently on stress dose steroids for adrenal insufficiency and has been weaned off pressors. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and reduced nutritional status.
2. Sepsis: The patient has already experienced severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. There is a risk of further infection and sepsis due to immunosuppression from steroids and prolonged ICU stay.
3. ARDS/acute lung injury: The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may require continued ventilator support. There is a risk of worsening lung function and potential need for tracheostomy.
4. Hypotension: The patient has experienced septic shock and may require continued monitoring and management of blood pressure.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, which may require transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hy"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old man with glioblastoma multiforme who was admitted to the ICU for progressive hypoxemia due to PCP pneumonia. He is currently on stress dose steroids for adrenal insufficiency and off pressors. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, and he requires high oxygen levels and large tidal volumes. There are concerns about potential pulmonary embolism and fluid overload. The patient also has anemia, low urine output with hyponatremia, and thrush. He has a history of GBM, CAD, and is on various medications including dexamethasone, antifungals, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Respiratory Failure/PCP: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and there is a risk of further respiratory failure secondary to PCP pneumonia. Pulmonary edema may also contribute to lung injury.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has tachycardia and hypoxemia, which are concerning for a possible PE. A CT angiography (CTA) has been ordered to evaluate for PE.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient is currently fluid overloaded, which can lead to further respiratory distress and complications.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with no obvious source, which can contribute to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and worsening hypoxia.
5. Low Urine Output/Hyponatremia: The patient's low urine output and hyponatremia need to be monitored closely, as it may indicate underlying issues such as SIADH or adrenal insufficiency.
6. Thrush: The patient has thrush, likely due to immunosuppression from steroids. This needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.
7. GBM: The patient's GBM requires ongoing management, including monitoring of steroid taper and potential radiation effects.
8. Cardiac Disease (CAD): The patient's CAD needs to be considered when managing his fluid balance and medication regimen.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to consult with the patient's healthcare team for a comprehensive evaluation and management plan."

   improved from shock/sepsis standpoint he remains critically ill in
   respiratory failure on significant ventilatory support with high PEEP
   and FIO2 requirements.  Updated family to CTA/head CT findings.  FIo2
   now at 75% (significantly higher than previously).HR has improved to

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of GBM on steroid taper admitted with fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient has shown a gradual worsening in respiratory status and oxygenation, with an acute decline this morning. The patient's primary issues include acute respiratory failure, ARDS, PCP pneumonia, pulmonary edema, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and CNS malignancy (GBM). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with increased FiO2 requirements and has been placed on DNR status with a transition to comfort measures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory status and oxygenation indicate the development of ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and the need for increased FiO2 suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema, which can be caused by fluid overload or heart failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fever and sepsis indicates a systemic infection that may lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency indicates a deficiency in cortisol production by the adrenal glands, leading to symptoms such as hypotension,"

   Pt has shown a gradual worsening in resp status/oxygenation with acute

   sedation or change in vent mode to PS making it difficult to maintain
   lung/ards protective low TVs.  As there have been no new fevers or
   secretions new resp infection seems unlikely and we are more concerned
   for acute insults such as PE or pnx.
   Agree with plan to repeat urgent cxr.  Would then pursue evaluation for
   PE with cta.  Consider empiric heparin but first need to clarify with
   neuron-onc regarding risks of anticoagulate given GBM. Overall pt is
   declining and family was updated to change in status.  Pt is now DNR .
   We will continue to address goals of care pending further change in
   status as family may be moving toward transition to comfort.
   We continue treatment for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] readdress with ID service

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) on steroid taper at home. He was admitted with fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient has shown a gradual worsening in respiratory status/oxygenation with an acute decline this morning. 

The patient's primary issues include acute respiratory failure, ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia), pulmonary edema, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and CNS malignancy (GBM). The patient's condition has been declining, and the family has been updated about the change in status. The patient has now made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision, and the goals of care are being addressed pending further change in status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): This is a severe lung condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the alveoli, leading to impaired gas exchange. It can lead to respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): This is a type of pneumonia caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii. It commonly affects individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or on immunosuppressive medications"

He was admitted with fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient's hemodynamics have improved, but he is showing a gradually worsening respiratory status and oxygenation on ventilator support. The patient's condition is complex and includes several potential medical complications.

1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Regular turning and pressure area care should be implemented.

2. Sepsis, Severe (with Organ Dysfunction): The patient presented with fever, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and sepsis. Active infection control measures, including appropriate antibiotic therapy, should continue.

3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient is critically ill and at risk for malnutrition. Nutritional support, such as enteral feeding, should be provided.

4. H/O Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Brain: The patient has a history of GBM. The cancer itself can contribute to immunosuppression and increase the risk of infections.

5. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has developed ARDS, characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. Continued ventilator support is necessary, and lung"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of glioblastoma multiforme (brain cancer) who developed PCP pneumonia while on a steroid taper. He required intubation on [6-16] due to progressive hypoxemia.
- He is currently on stress dose steroids for adrenal insufficiency and off pressors.
- The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, and his oxygenation has also deteriorated.
- He has single organ failure secondary to PCP pneumonia with possible pulmonary edema.
- After a family meeting, the decision has been made to transition to comfort measures only. The patient is likely to die quickly after turning off the ventilator.
- Discontinue all medications, start morphine drip to control pain, anxiety, and respiratory distress.
- Plan for terminal extubation today when all family members and rabbi are present.
- PCP and oncologist are aware of the current goals of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status and oxygenation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Given his aggressive ventilator settings, he is likely to die quickly after turning off the vent.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has a likely secondary tachycardia due to sepsis and possible intravascular volume depletion. It is important to"

   sedation and positive pressure ventilation. Initially may have had
   component of hypovolemia but now fluid overloaded. Adrenally
   insufficient
 stess dose steroids x5 days, now off. Cardiogenic
   etiology less likely given relatively normal [**Name (NI) **].
   -[**Name (NI) 5901**] for PCP as above
   - s/p 5 days of stress dose steroids, switching to PCP tx doses
   [**Name9 (PRE) 4837**] to hold outpatient atenolol and quinapril
   - off pressors over 48 hours
   - tachycardic to 120s but not hypotensive, CTA as above.
   .
   # Anemia: no obvious source, perhaps dilutional as given additional
   volume yesterday with NS
   - Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - stable today
   .
   # Low urine output/ hyponatremia: Improved when [**Hospital1 **] given in NS,
   but unable to continue this. U studies equivocal in terms of dignosing
   SIADH.
   - Monitor with [**Hospital1 **] Na
   - minimize free water
   .
   #. GBM
   Previously on prolonged dexamethasone taper [**3-12**] radiation with
   resultant edema in brainstem.
   - as per outpt notes dexamethasone taper would have ended on [**6-18**]
   -continue PPI given steroids, intracranial lesion
   - Head CT as may be initiating heaprin drip
   #Thrush
   -Likely [**3-12**] immunosuppression from steroids
   -continue Nystatin
   # CAD: holding BP meds but continuing statin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of glioblastoma multiforme who developed PCP pneumonia and required intubation. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has thrush, likely due to immunosuppression from steroids.
2. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient is suspected to have sepsis secondary to PCP pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
3. Alteration in nutrition: The patient may have impaired nutritional status due to prolonged hospitalization and sedation.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient is experiencing worsening respiratory failure, likely secondary to PCP pneumonia with pulmonary edema.
5. Hypotension (not shock): The patient has hypotension, possibly due to sepsis, sedation, and positive pressure ventilation. Initially, there may have been a component of hypovolemia but now fluid overload.
6. Hypoxemia: The patient has persistent hypoxemia.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia with no obvious source, possibly dilutional as he received additional volume yesterday with normal saline.
8. Low urine output/hyponatremia: The patient had low urine output initially but improved when given [**Hospital1**]. The cause of hyponatremia is unclear, and it may be related to SIADH or fluid overload.
9. GBM: The patient has a history of glioblastoma multiforme and was on prolonged dexamethasone taper.
10. Thrush: The patient has developed thrush, likely due to immunosuppression from steroids.
11. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is holding BP meds but continuing statin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of further infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or ventilator-associated pneumonia, worsening sepsis, and complications related to the underlying glioblastoma multiforme."
