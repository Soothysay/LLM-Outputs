   been stable.
   - Discontinued OCPs
   - Continue heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and initiate
   warfarin when stability more assured
   - LENIs to help determine if large lower extremity clot burden, which

   - TTE to assess for any right heart strain in setting of large
   bilateral pulmonary embolism
   - will have to determine best outpatient anticoagulation strategy and
   when this should start as an inpatient.  Would favor keeping on heparin
   gtt alone as long as possible given ability to reverse rapidly

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding. She presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week. A CT angiography (CTA) reveals extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli and a possible right lower lobe pulmonary infarct. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 131/87 mmHg and heart rate of 89 bpm. She is currently receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin and will initiate warfarin when stability is more assured. The patient also has ongoing uterine bleeding, for which she has received Lupron. Her hematocrit (HCT) is stable, and she is being monitored closely for any signs of a brisk bleed while on full anticoagulation. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on [**Hospital1**], and she is currently on multiple medications including acetaminophen, docusate sodium, ferrous gluconate, heparin, leuprolide acetate, naproxen, oxycontin, potassium chloride, senna, sodium chloride 0.9% flush, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, which can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and potentially fatal complications if not properly managed with anticoagulation therapy.
2. Pulmonary infar"

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding. She presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week and has been diagnosed with extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli. There is also a possible right lower lobe pulmonary infarct. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8 C (100.6 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 131/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, which can lead to further complications such as pulmonary infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or even death if not properly managed.
2. Uterine Bleeding: The patient has a history of increased uterine bleeding prior to her presentation, which could be related to her uterine fibroids. This can lead to significant blood loss and anemia if not managed appropriately.
3. Anemia: The patient's current hematocrit (HCT) level is stable, but she may require ongoing management and monitoring due to her history of anemia and potential for further blood loss.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient is currently receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin and will be initiated on warfar"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old female with a chief complaint of significant bleeding. The patient's Hct has been stable but had an episode of significant bleeding at 3:30pm, leading to the transfusion of 1 unit of blood as she was still actively bleeding. Another episode of heavy bleeding occurred in the middle of the night, resulting in a repeat Hct at 11am. The patient's gynecological condition requires consideration of myomectomy or uterine artery embolization, with UAE favored over myomectomy. Leupron should work within a week. The patient's TTE shows LVEF >55%, borderline pulmonary hypertension, and relatively normal findings. No evidence of DVT was observed on either side. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at risk of developing a PE due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU, history of gynecological condition, and elevated D-dimer levels.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of significant bleeding, indicating a possible underlying bleeding disorder or coagulopathy.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although no evidence of DVT was found in either lower extremity, the patient's immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing a DVT.
4. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures can increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as"

   Assessment and Plan
   29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid
   bleeding, presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one
   week.
    #. PEs: Patient noting 3 days of severe pleuritic chest pain. No
   association with hemoptysis. CTA shows extensive bilateral PE without
   evidence of Right Heart Strain. EKG shows TWI in lead III, otherwise
   without signs of right heart strain. Heart rate and blood pressure have
   been stable.  LENIs negative and TTE with no signs of right heart
   strain.
   - Discontinued OCPs
   - Continue heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and initiate
   warfarin when stability more assured
   - will have to determine best outpatient anticoagulation strategy and
   when this should start as an inpatient.  Would favor keeping on heparin
   gtt alone as long as possible given ability to reverse rapidly and
   possibility of procedures this admission
   #. Uterine bleeding: Patient noting increased bleeding in the 4 to 5
   days leading up to presentation to the hospital. Denies
   lightheadedness, syncope.
   - Patient received Lupron [**11-28**].
   - f/u OB/Gyn recs to assist in management of uterine bleeding while on
   full anticoagulation: suggested if hematocrit dropping significantly
   and heavy bleeding persists, once therapeutically anticoagulated, can
   consider a course medroxyprogesterone 10mg daily to help stabilize the
   endometrium
   -F/u Ob/Gyn decision re myomect vs uterine artery embolization and
   timing
   - Telemetry and Q8H HCT monitoring to assure no brisk bleed in setting
   of full anticoagulation -> next Hct due 11 am because AM labs drawn
   right after transfusion
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Two large bore Ivs
   #. Anemia: Currently her HCT is stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding. She presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week and has been experiencing heavy vaginal bleeding in the past few days. She is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has been experiencing severe pleuritic chest pain and a CT angiogram (CTA) shows extensive bilateral PE without evidence of right heart strain. This indicates that blood clots have formed in the pulmonary arteries, causing blockage and potentially leading to serious complications such as respiratory distress and cardiac issues.
2. Uterine bleeding: The patient's history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding suggests ongoing heavy vaginal bleeding. This can lead to significant blood loss, resulting in hypovolemic shock and anemia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient's lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) is negative for DVT, it does not completely rule out the possibility of DVT. If left untreated, DVT can potentially lead to PE.
4. Anticoagulation management: The patient is on a heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and will initiate warfarin therapy. Managing anticoagulation therapy requires careful monitoring of coagulation parameters to prevent both thrombotic events (such as PE) and"

","The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding, presenting with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week. She has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute PE, as indicated by extensive bilateral PE seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA) without evidence of right heart strain. The EKG shows T-wave inversion in lead III, but there are no signs of right heart strain. The patient's heart rate and blood pressure have been stable.

The patient is also experiencing uterine bleeding, with increased bleeding noted in the 4 to 5 days leading up to her hospital presentation. She denies lightheadedness and syncope. The patient received Lupron on [11-28]. The obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN) recommendations include f/u OB/GYN recs to assist in management of uterine bleeding while on full anticoagulation. If the patient's hematocrit drops significantly and heavy bleeding persists, a course of medroxyprogesterone 10mg daily may be considered to help stabilize the endometrium.

   Assessment and Plan
 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   29 yo female with history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid
   bleeding, presents with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one
   week.
    #. PEs: Patient noting 3 days of severe pleuritic chest pain. No
   association with hemoptysis. CTA shows extensive bilateral PE without
   evidence of Right Heart Strain. EKG shows TWI in lead III, otherwise
   without signs of right heart strain. Heart rate and blood pressure have
   been stable.  LENIs negative and TTE with no signs of right heart
   strain.
   - Discontinued OCPs
   - Continue heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation and initiate
   warfarin when stability more assured
   - will have to determine best outpatient anticoagulation strategy and
   when this should start as an inpatient.  Would favor keeping on heparin
   gtt alone as long as possible given ability to reverse rapidly and
   possibility of procedures this admission
   - advised patient that we would like to switch from naproxen because of
   bleeding risk.
   #. Uterine bleeding: Patient noting increased bleeding in the 4 to 5
   days leading up to presentation to the hospital. Denies
   lightheadedness, syncope.
   - Patient received Lupron [**11-28**].
   -check Hct at 10am with PTT
   - f/u OB/Gyn recs to assist in management of uterine bleeding while on
   full anticoagulation: suggested if hematocrit dropping significantly
   and heavy bleeding persists, once therapeutically anticoagulated, can
   consider a course medroxyprogesterone 10mg daily to help stabilize the
   endometrium
   - Per Ob/Gyn would like to avoid procedure such as myomectomy or UAE;
   will not pursue unless patient transfusion resistant and unable to
   maintain Hct > 25.
   - Telemetry and Q8H HCT monitoring to assure no brisk bleed in setting
   of full anticoagulation
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Two large bore Ivs
   #. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Currently her HCT is stable.
   - Ferrous gluconate 325 mg [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of anemia secondary to uterine fibroid bleeding. She presented with pleuritic chest pain for approximately one week and was found to have extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA). There is no evidence of right heart strain. The patient's heart rate and blood pressure have been stable. EKG shows T wave inversion in lead III, but no signs of right heart strain. She was advised to discontinue oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) and continue heparin drip for systemic anticoagulation. Warfarin therapy will be initiated when her stability is assured.

The patient also reported increased uterine bleeding in the four to five days leading up to her hospital presentation. She denies lightheadedness and syncope. She received an injection of Lupron on [11-28]. Her hematocrit (Hct) levels have been monitored, and she is scheduled for a check at 10 am with Prothrombin Time Test (PTT). The patient was advised to follow up with an obstetrician-gynecologist (OB/GYN) for management of uterine bleeding while on full anticoagulation. The OB/GYN suggested considering a course of medroxyprogesterone 10 mg daily to help stabilize the endometrium. The patient's Hct level needs to remain above 25."
