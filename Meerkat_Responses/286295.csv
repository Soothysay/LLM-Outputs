   MICU RESIDENT HISTORY AND PHYSICAL
   .
   CHIEF COMPLAINT: transfered from [**Hospital1 608**] for sepsis and CA w/u
   .
   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Age over 90 **] yo F with CAD s/p CABG in [**2096**] and [**Hospital 11316**]
   transfered from [**Hospital1 608**] for sepsis and CA w/u. The patient reports that
   she was treated for PNA with abx and then thoracentesis two weeks ago.
   Since then, the patient does note that she has had problems with
   dysuria for the past several weeks and recently saw a ""kidney doctor""
   for it, but details of that are not clear.  She states that she was
   prescribed several pills by her kidney doctor, but this morning the
   ""white pill"" did not help. She noted one day prior to admission that
   she had been unable to urinate with suprapubic pain. She called her PCP
   who recommended that she go to [**Hospital3 611**].
   .
    While there, the patient was noted to be in ARF with Cr of 2.5.  She
   was also noted to have leukocytosis with WBC of 11.9 and 82% PMNs.  She
   was given 2mg of Hydromorhone and Zofran.  CT abdomen was performed and
   was notable for ascites and diffuse nodular changes in periotoneal
   cavity and on omentum suggesting carcinomatosis.  The stomach is
   herniated into chest cavity.  Left kideny had 1.5 mm lower pole and 5.5
   exophytic cyst as well as 1mm nonobtracting calculus.  Right kidney had
   no evidence of obstruction.  CT of lungs was significant for collapsed
   left lung with left chest cavity filled with fluid,  significant
   compression and collapse of the right lower lobe with large right
   pleural effusion. She was also noted to be hypotensive to SBP of 80/50
   after CT scan and was bolused with fluids.  The patient was started on
   Vanc and Zosyn for presumed sepsis and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further
   care.
   .
   The patient reports that she currently feels well, s/o lightheadness,
   dizziness, CP, no abd -resolved. She endorsed mild SOB with slight
   sputum production as of today. No fever, no chills.
   .
   In the emergency department, initial vitals were HR 67 BP 79/60 RR 23
   and O2 sat: 97% on 3L NC.  15 minutes later BP decreased further to SBP
   of 68 and Levophed was initiated.   The patient was mentating and
   responding appropriately, appeared comfortable.  The patient also
   received a right femoral line.   Troponins 0.04 x 1. The patient was
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for likely sepsis.  On transfer, vitals were T98.0 HR
   72 BP 101/68 RR 30 93% 3L.

   Assessment and Plan
   #. Hypotension: Low BP and elevated WBC suggest possible sepsis,
   distrubutive shock - unlikely cardiac w/o CP or elevated CK.
   Pericardial effusion is also unlikely w/o low voltage EKG and no JVD,
   no effusion of CT chest. Infectious sources could be GI given
   carcinomatosis as well as pulmonary given recent dx PNA. Although there
   was no definate infiltrate on CT chest, there was significant lung
   collapse and effusion to make evaluation difficult. UA neg. It is also
   possible that the patient had an adverse rxn dilauded or Ct contrast as
   she was normotensive on arrival to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 608**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73**]. Given ongoing pressor
   requirement, will tx empirically with vanc and zosyn.

   #. Oliguric renal failure: cr 2.9, bland sediment, minimal UOP -
   pre-renal vs ATN. Renal failure may be [**12-28**] low BP, but I am concerned
   that she had renal failure even before becoming hypotensive - at least
   presumably she was not hypotensive on her first visit to nephrology. It
   is possble that she has AIN from abx for initial PNA. no hydronephrosis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of sepsis, CA workup, previous pneumonia, and cardiac issues including CAD and CABG. The patient presented with dysuria, inability to urinate, and suprapubic pain, leading to the diagnosis of acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 2.5. The patient also has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.9 and 82% PMNs.

The patient's CT abdomen showed ascites and diffuse nodular changes in the peritoneal cavity and on the omentum, suggesting carcinomatosis. The stomach is herniated into the chest cavity, and there is a left kidney with a 1.5 mm lower pole and a 5.5 exophytic cyst as well as a 1 mm nonobstructing calculus. The right kidney appears normal. CT of the lungs revealed a collapsed left lung with fluid in the left chest cavity, significant compression and collapse of the right lower lobe, and a large right pleural effusion.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 79/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 3 liters nasal cannula. The patient is alert, oriented, and appropriate with fluent speech. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds bilater"

","Summary:
The patient is a pleasant, elderly female who presents with worsening respiratory distress, difficulty completing sentences, and significantly labored breathing. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have dropped into the 80s while on a 50% humidified face mask. Radiographic imaging shows worsening infiltrates in the right upper and middle lobes. The patient is also experiencing hypotension and has an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting possible sepsis or distributive shock. There is a suspicion of pericardial effusion, but no evidence of it was found on the chest X-ray and CT chest. The patient has a history of colorectal cancer, for which she underwent surgery and chemotherapy, and now presents with carcinomatosis and pleural effusions. Other medical conditions include a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 91/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a medium concentration mask. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension and possible sepsis or distributive shock due to low blood pressure and elevated WBC count.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure due to significant effusions, left lung collapse, and/or pneumonia.
3. Oliguric renal failure with a creatinine level"

   4. Mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
   5. Ill-defined lesion within the left lower pelvis, in the expected
   location of the uterus and adnexa, with calcifications seen. The origin
   and etiology of this lesion is unclear without intravenous contrast,
   and could reflect a uterine fibroid, or adnexal lesion. This can be
   correlated by ultrasound if clinically indicated.
   6. Prominence of the cecal and sigmoid colonic walls. Correlate with
   colonoscopy findings.
   -Thoracentesis done (2300 mL off); chest tube placed to water seal
   -Renal recs: etiology of renal failure is pre-renal, can treat with
   fluids; at high risk of transition to ATN; need to determine baseline
   creatinine

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 37 years ago. The patient was transferred from Hospital1 for hypotension, renal failure, and cancer workup, likely ovarian primary.

The patient presented with hypotension and elevated white blood cell count, suggesting possible sepsis or distributive shock. There is also a pericardial effusion present but no low voltage EKG or jugular venous distention (JVD) observed. Infectious sources could be gastrointestinal given carcinomatosis or pulmonary due to recent pneumonia (PNA). Although there is no definite infiltrate on the CT chest, significant lung collapse and effusion make evaluation difficult. Urinalysis is negative.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to significant effusions, left lung collapse, and/or PNA. The patient's condition has been worsening, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation with assist-control (AC) mode, tidal volume of 4ml/kg, FiO2 at 100% (to be weaned as tolerated), and PEEP at 10 cmH2O. Sedation is maintained with Versed and Fentanyl. A chest X-ray is ordered to evaluate endotracheal tube (ETT) placement and oxygenation. A chest tube will be placed to decompress the pleural space, and thoracentesis will"

 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2117-10-3**] 11:30 PM
   -Intubated yesterday AM  for respiratory failure
   -CT torso (w/o IV contrast) showed:
   1. Large L- pleural effusion, w/ near complete collapse and
   consolidation of L-lungs
   2. Moderate-to-large R pleural effusion.
   3. Ascites, with diffuse nodularity of the peritoneum, suspicious for
   peritoneal carcinomatosis.
   4. Mesenteric lymphadenopathy.
   5. Ill-defined lesion within the left lower pelvis, in the expected
   location of the uterus and adnexa, with calcifications seen. The origin
   and etiology of this lesion is unclear without intravenous contrast,
   and could reflect a uterine fibroid, or adnexal lesion. This can be
   correlated by ultrasound if clinically indicated.
   6. Prominence of the cecal and sigmoid colonic walls. Correlate with
   colonoscopy findings.
   -Thoracentesis done (2300 mL off); chest tube placed to water seal
   -Renal recs: etiology of renal failure is pre-renal, can treat with
   fluids; at high risk of transition to ATN; need to determine baseline
   creatinine
   -Obtained outside records from [**Hospital3 **] (in chart) -
   thoracentesis cultures negative to date
   -Will need gyn/onc consult
   -Placed left femoral a-line after failed attempts at both radial
   arteries

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of CAD and previous CABG, who presented with respiratory failure and was intubated. She has multiple comorbidities including carcinomatosis, pleural effusions, ascites, and oliguric renal failure. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, hypoxic respiratory failure, and pre-renal acute kidney injury. She is currently on invasive ventilation and arterial line monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count suggest possible sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's pre-renal acute kidney injury may progress to acute tubular necrosis if not managed appropriately. Additionally, her respiratory failure may lead to further lung complications.

3. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and underlying malignancy.

4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of CAD and previous CABG puts her at increased risk for cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia.

5. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 37 years ago. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension, renal failure, and cancer workup, likely ovarian primary. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count suggest possible sepsis and distributive shock. There is no pericardial effusion in the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is being maintained above 60 mmHg with the use of levophed and vasopressin. 

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to significant effusions, left lung collapse, and/or pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 4 mL/kg, FiO2 at 100%, and PEEP at 4-10 cmH2O. Sedation with Versed and Fentanyl is being used. Chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest are needed to evaluate endotracheal tube and oxygenation gas exchange placement. A chest tube may be necessary for decompression of the pleural space, along with thoracentesis. Serial arterial blood gases (ABGs) should"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), was transferred from Hospital1 for hypotension, renal failure, and cancer workup, likely ovarian primary. Upon arrival, she was found to have significant effusions, left lung collapse, and possibly pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a blood pressure of 94/50 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has been receiving IV fluids and vasopressor support with levophed and vasopressin.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal platelet count. Her blood cultures are pending. She has pleural fluid that is being analyzed for infection, and her urine and blood cultures are also pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count suggest possible sepsis and distributive shock. There is no pericardial effusion seen on transthoracic echocardiogram, and the patient's response to stimulation test is appropriate. The likelihood of pulmonary embolism is low. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazob"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 37 years ago. She was transferred from another hospital for hypotension, renal failure, and cancer workup, likely ovarian primary. The patient presented with hypotension, respiratory failure, oliguric renal failure, new carcinomatosis, and a history of CAD s/p CABG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure suggests possible sepsis or distributive shock. Infectious sources could be GI given carcinomatosis or pulmonary given recent diagnosis of pneumonia (PNA).
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has significantly worsening respiratory failure, likely due to significant effusions, left lung collapse, and/or PNA. Immediate intubation with mechanical ventilation and chest tube placement for decompression of the pleural space is recommended.
3. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 2.5, indicating oliguric renal failure. Renal failure may be secondary to low blood pressure or a more chronic process. Hold lasix and anti-HTN, monitor urine output, and consider renal consult.
4. New Carcinomatosis: The patient has evidence of carcinomatosis on CT scan with pleural effusions. Cytologies from OSH recent thoracentesis and follow-up cytologies from pleural fluid are"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of respiratory failure, likely due to a massive left pleural effusion and malignant ascites. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm and blood pressure of 81/46 mmHg. She has a temperature of 36.2°C and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator. The patient's respiratory support includes a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which is likely due to the massive left pleural effusion and malignant ascites. Her current condition is being managed with mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, most likely secondary to sepsis. She is on two pressors to maintain her blood pressure and more fluid challenges are planned.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely secondary to hypovolemia/hypotension. Her creatinine levels are improving.
4. Anemia: The patient has a decreased hematocrit level, indicating anemia. This may be dilutional due to a positive fluid balance in the past 24 hours.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 37 years ago, who was transferred from Hospital1 for hypotension, renal failure, and cancer workup, likely ovarian primary. The patient has been in the ICU for the past 4 days.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 87/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 5L NC. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 82, plateau pressure is 12 cmH2O, and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 230.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, glucose of 102 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 1.2 mg/dL, albumin of 2.3 g/dL, and lactic acid of 1.7 mmol/L. The platelet count is 381 K/uL, and the international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.1.

The patient's assessment and plan include several issues:

1. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive despite being on vasopressor support. There is no evidence of pericardial effusion on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The patient has an appropriate response to a stimulation test, making pulmonary embolism (PE) unlikely. However, the patient has leukocytosis and persistent hypotension, which may suggest sepsis or distributive shock. Further evaluation is needed, including obtaining vancomycin trough levels, WBC differential, and new blood, sputum, and urine cultures. The patient should continue on vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) >90 mmHg, and wean as tolerated.

2. Pleural effusions/respiratory status: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery, admitted to the ICU for hypotension, renal failure, and cancer workup. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, oliguric renal failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, and new carcinomatosis with pleural effusions. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The medical team's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count suggest possible sepsis or distributive shock. There is no pericardial effusion seen on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Vasopressin and norepinephrine are being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 90 mmHg. Weaning of vasopressors will be done as tolerated.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient likely developed hypoxic respiratory failure due to significant effusions, left lung collapse, and/or pneumonia. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is planned today. If tolerated, extubation may be considered. Serial arterial blood gases (ABGs) will be monitored, and the arterial line will be re-sited.

3. Oliguric renal failure: The patient's creatinine"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): In setting of large
   pleural effusion, ?malignant.  Requiring 5 L NC to maintain saturations
   >93%.  CT in place.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  Combination of low oncotic pressure and
   possible early sepsis given elevated WBC.  Check differential, repeat
   blood and urine cultures.  Continue on current antibiotics unless she
   decompensates further.
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), GYNECOLOGICAL (OVARIAN, UTERINE,
   CERVICAL, ENDOMETRIAL):  Awaiting final path/cytology.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Cr continues to
   improve.  Adjust med dosing accordingly.  Good urine output.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS:  WBC slightly increased from yesterday.
 DEPRESSION:  Reactive depression to recently finding out probable
   diagnosis of malignancy.
 ABDOMINAL PAIN:  Abdomen remains nondistended.  Minimally tender in
   lower quadrants, no guarding.  Likely related to underlying
   malignancy.  Minimal ascites on prior CT albeit with increased WBC may
   consider reimaging to see if there is enough for a diagnostic
   pericentesis.

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient was intubated and received invasive ventilation, which was stopped on 10/5/2117 at 4:03 PM. The patient continues to be extubated.

The patient required fluid boluses overnight due to hypotension and responded to them. Vasopressin was restarted after giving more than 2 L of fluids. The patient also complained of abdominal discomfort and received 0.5 mg IV morphine.

The patient has a history of piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) antibiotic use on 10/5/2117 at 2:31 AM, vancomycin on 10/6/2117 at 12:43 AM, and piperacillin on 10/5/2117 at 2:08 PM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74/38 mmHg to 135/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's rhythm is AV paced.

The patient has been receiving continuous infusion of vasopressin at a rate of 2.4 units/hour. They have also been receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis) since 10/6/2117 at 12:42 AM.

The patient's review of systems shows fatigue, abdominal pain, anemia, and depressed affect. The patient has been experiencing diminished breath sounds on both sides, right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and tender minimal lower abdominal pain with palpation.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, platelet count of 381 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 102 mg/dL, total CO2 level of 26, and other laboratory values within normal ranges.

Imaging results show pleural effusions on the right side larger than on the left side, possibly malignant.

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to large pleural effusion, possibly malignant. The patient requires 5 L NC to maintain saturations >93%. CT imaging is in place. The patient also has hypotension not due to shock, with low oncotic pressure and possible early sepsis given elevated WBC. Blood and urine cultures should be repeated, and current antibiotics should be continued unless the patient decompensates further. The patient has cancer, likely malignant, awaiting final path/cytology. Acute renal failure is improving, and medication dosing should be adjusted accordingly. Good urine output is noted. Leukocytosis is present with a slightly increased WBC count. Depression is"

   [**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ CAD s/p CABG ([**2096**]), x-fer from [**Hospital1 608**] for hypotension,
   renal failure and cancer workup, likely ovarian primary.
   #. Hypotension: Low BP and elevated WBC suggest possible sepsis,
   distrubutive shock.  There is no pericardial effusion in TTE.. [**Last Name (un) **]
   stim test demostrated appropriate response.  PE is highly unlikely.
   Increasing leukocytosis today and persistent hypotension, although no
   fevers, decent UOP.
   - Vanc and Zosyn, currently day 4.
   - Obtain Vanc trough
   - Obtain WBC differential
   - f/u cultures from [**Hospital1 608**] as well as [**Hospital1 19**]
   -Send new Blood, sputum, urine cx given increasing leukocytosis
   - hold anti-HTN and lasix
   - continue  Levophed and vasopressin as needed for MAP >60, SBP >90.
   Wean as tolerated.
   - Minimal IVF boluses, as needed to keep MAP > 60.  Try colloid instead
   of crystalloid given low Albumin.
   .
   # Pleural effusions / Respiratory status:
   -Monitor resp. status closely today.  Repeat CXR if increasing work of
   breathing, tachypnea.
   -Continue Vanc/zosyn
   -Minimize IVF as they may lead to reaccumulation of fluid
   .
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr 1.2 and improving, likely pre-renal /
   secondary to hypotension.  No evidence of obstruction / no
   hydronephrosis on OSH CT.
   - Hold lasix and anti-HTN
   - Monitor UOP and Cr daily
   -Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #.  New carcinomatosis on CT / pleural effusions: last CA screening
   (mammogram, pap and colonoscopy 10-20 years ago).  Concerning due to
   elevated CEA and CA125.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. She was transferred from another hospital due to hypotension, renal failure, and a suspected ovarian primary cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU for further evaluation and treatment.

The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure and a slightly elevated heart rate. The respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, low albumin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results, including electrolytes and kidney function, are provided in the note.

The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, oliguric renal failure, pleural effusions, and suspected carcinomatosis. The plan is to continue with the current antibiotic regimen, monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, minimize intravenous fluid administration, and perform regular urine output and creatinine level monitoring.

The patient's past medical history includes coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery. She is also on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy for deep vein thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include sepsis due to the low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count, worsening renal function, respiratory failure, and complications related to the suspected cancer. Close"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several ongoing medical conditions and complications. The key findings and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. The patient is comfortable on a nasal cannula, but further intervention such as changing to a humidified face mask is recommended.

2. Pleural effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion, with decreased output from the chest tube. Cytology results are negative to date, and a consultation with medical oncology has been requested.

3. Hypotension: Despite being fluid overloaded, the patient remains intravascularly depleted. IVF bolus and consideration of albumin administration are suggested.

4. Cancer: The patient has a history of gynecological malignancy (ovarian, uterine, cervical, or endometrial cancer) for which a medical oncology consult has been ordered.

5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have shown slight improvement, indicating acute renal failure (ARF).

6. ICU care: The patient is receiving various interventions, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer protection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

It is important to note that the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management of these complications are necessary."

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 37 years ago. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, renal failure, and cancer workup. She has been diagnosed with oliguric renal failure, pleural effusions, and possible sepsis or distributive shock. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, as well as IV fluids and blood pressure support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure suggests possible sepsis or distributive shock. The team is monitoring her MAP and providing IVF boluses as needed to maintain it above 60 mmHg.
2. Pleural Effusions/Respiratory Status: The patient continues to drain a large amount of fluid through the chest tube. Chest tube removal may be considered once the fluid reaccumulation is under control. Respiratory status should be closely monitored, and repeat CXR may be done if there is an increase in work of breathing or tachypnea.
3. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is improving, suggesting pre-renal or secondary oliguric renal failure due to hypotension. Lasix and anti-HTN medications have been held, and UOP and Cr levels will be monitored daily. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are recommended.
4. New Carcinomatosis on CT/Pleural Effusions: The patient has developed new carcinomatosis on CT with pleural effusions. Cytologies from recent thoracentesis and pleural fluid will be obtained for further evaluation. Tylenol and Morphine will be given as needed for pain, and a Med/Onc consult is required.
5. History of CAD s/p CABG: The patient's history of CAD requires continued cardiac support, including statin therapy and holding beta-blockers.

Overall, the patient is stable with controlled pain and improved breathing. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory results is necessary to manage potential complications and optimize her condition."
