   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9945**] is an 82 yo female with severe chronic diastolic HF, afib
   on coumadin, HTN, moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid
   arthritis, chronic anemia who is s/p hip replacement for mechanical
   fall, now with post-op hypoxia secondary to diastolic CHF.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to diastolic CHF given that she is
   known to have significant diastolic CHF and has had several admissions
   for CHF exacerbations.  She reportedly got only 1L NS in the OR and 2
   units of FFP.  Additionally her post-op pain may have contributed to
   tachycardia and worsening diastolic dysfunction.  CXR consistent with
   acute pulmonary edema.  She has no clear evidence of pneumonia at
   present.  She is know to have pulmonary hypertension. If no improvement
   with rate control and diuresis, consider CTA to evaluate for PE.
   - dilt drip for HR control in 70-90s as long as blood pressure
   tolerates it
   - pain control with around the clock tylenol and prn dilaudid to avoid
   worsening tachycardia
   - lasix 20 IV for goal negative 500 ccs
   - bp control with nitropaste/drip as needed for hypertensive, though
   currenly low normal bp on diltiazem drip
   - a-line for frequent abgs
   - continue home digoxin
   - continue spironolactone
   .
   2. Seizure.  Family denies history of seizure though patient has a
   keppra allergy suggesting seizure activity at some point.  Her new
   focal motor seizure concerning for focal brain lesion.  At present, not
   stable enough to lay flat for head CT.
   - CT head when more stable
   - avoid benzos given how sedated she was after 2 mg of ativan
   - neuro consult in AM re management of focal partial motor seizures
   .
   3.  S/p hip replacement.  Patient post-op for hip replacement.  Per
   neuro, able to weight bear fully on both legs now.
   - lovenox ppx and coumadin to [**Last Name (un) 9947**] AM
   - pain control with around the clock tylenol and low dose dilaudid
   - ortho following
   - continue fosamax, calcium/ vitamin d for osteoporosis
   .
   4.  A. fib with RVR.  Patient with A. fib with RVR post-operatively
   leading to diastolic CHF exacerbation.  Now rate controlled with dilt
   drip.
   - hold oral nodal agents overnight while on dilt drip
   - resume coumadin in AM and cover with prophylactic lovenox while
   awaiting therapeutic INR
   - dilt drip for rate control
   - continue dig
   .
   5. CAD.  Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated without ischemic changes on
   EKG.  Likely secondary to demand.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - on dilt drip for rate control
   - hold BB
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   6.  Hypertension.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - dilt drip for BP control with goal BP in 100s to 120s systolic
   .
   6. Rheumatoid arthritis.  Patient is chronically on methotrexate and 5
   mg of prednisone
   - continue methotrexate and prednisone
   - no current indication for stress dose steroids, but low threshold to
   start if hypotensive
   .
   7. Osteoporosis.
   - continue fosamax
   - calcium/ vitamin d
   .
   8. Gout.
   - allopurinol

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of severe chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic anemia. She underwent a hip replacement surgery and is currently experiencing post-operative hypoxia secondary to diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath (SOB), which is likely due to diastolic CHF. She also has acute pulmonary edema, as evidenced by her chest X-ray. There is no clear evidence of pneumonia at present. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/47 to 152/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her temperature is slightly elevated at 37.6°C. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, sodium level of 154 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, and blood glucose level of 154 mg/dL. Her creatinine level is elevated at 1.7 mg/dL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular issues, and her neurologic examination is not assessed due to her unstable condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9945**] is an 82 yo female with severe chronic diastolic HF, afib
   on coumadin, HTN, moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid
   arthritis, chronic anemia who is s/p hip replacement for mechanical
   fall, now with post-op hypoxia secondary to diastolic CHF.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to diastolic CHF given that she is
   known to have significant diastolic CHF and has had several admissions
   for CHF exacerbations.  She reportedly got only 1L NS in the OR and 2
   units of FFP.  Additionally her post-op pain may have contributed to
   tachycardia and worsening diastolic dysfunction.  CXR last night
   consistent with acute pulmonary edema.  She has no clear evidence of
   pneumonia at present.  She is know to have pulmonary hypertension. If
   no improvement with rate control and diuresis, consider CTA to evaluate
   for PE.
   - taper dilt drip and resume home BB, spironolactone, and lisinopril if
   able
   - goal HR 70s-80s
   - goal BPs 90s to 110s systolics
   - pain control with around the clock tylenol and prn morphine to avoid
   worsening tachycardia
   - resume home lasix dose
   - a-line for frequent abgs
   - continue home digoxin
   .
   2. Seizure.  Family denies history of seizure though patient has a
   keppra allergy suggesting seizure activity at some point.  Her new
   focal motor seizure concerning for focal brain lesion.  CT head
   negative preliminarily.
   - avoid benzos given how sedated she was after 2 mg of ativan
   - neuro consult in AM
   .
   3.  S/p hip replacement.  Patient post-op for hip replacement.  Per
   neuro, able to weight bear fully on both legs now.
   - lovenox ppx and coumadin to [**Last Name (un) 9947**] AM
   - pain control with around the clock tylenol and low dose morphine
   - ortho following
   - continue fosamax, calcium/ vitamin d for osteoporosis
   .
   4.  A. fib with RVR.  Patient with A. fib with RVR post-operatively
   leading to diastolic CHF exacerbation.  Now rate controlled with dilt
   drip.
   - resume oral metoprolol and taper off dilt drip
   - resume coumadin in AM and cover with prophylactic lovenox while
   awaiting therapeutic INR
   - continue dig
   .
   5. CAD.  Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated without ischemic changes on
   EKG.  Likely secondary to demand.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - taper off dilt drip for rate control
   - resume BB
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   6.  Hypertension.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - dilt drip for BP control with goal BP in 100s to 120s systolic
   .
   6. Rheumatoid arthritis.  Patient is chronically on methotrexate and 5
   mg of prednisone
   - continue methotrexate and prednisone
   - no current indication for stress dose steroids, but low threshold to
   start if hypotensive
   .
   7. Osteoporosis.
   - continue fosamax
   - calcium/ vitamin d
   .
   8. Gout.
   - allopurinol

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with severe chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic anemia. She underwent hip replacement surgery and is now experiencing post-operative hypoxia secondary to diastolic congestive heart failure. The patient's chief complaint is acute pulmonary edema, and she has a history of several admissions for congestive heart failure exacerbations.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/47 to 152/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature of 37.6°C. Her physical examination reveals clear lungs anteriorly, left hip pain, regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops, and her mental status has improved.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, sodium level of 154 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.04. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's plan includes several goals, such as controlling her heart rate in the 70s-80s, managing blood pressure in the 90s to 110s systolic"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), multiple prior admissions for congestive heart failure exacerbation, and a recent mechanical fall resulting in a left femoral neck fracture. The patient underwent total hip replacement surgery and experienced post-operative hypoxia requiring non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BIPAP). She also had two episodes of focal motor seizures, with the second one treated with lorazepam resulting in unresponsiveness but followed by improved mental status. The head CT was negative, and the patient was started on diltiazem for rate control. Overnight, the patient showed resolution of acute metabolic acidosis, and her oxygen requirement decreased.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of heart failure and poor forward flow, which can lead to renal hypoperfusion and acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, and diuresis should be managed accordingly.
2. Seizure Disorder: The patient experienced two episodes of focal motor seizures post-operatively. A neurology consultation is recommended for further management. Avoiding benzodiazepines and considering an MRI may be necessary.
3. Anemia: Presumed related to surgery, anemia can lead to decreased oxygen carrying capacity and tissue perfusion. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and considering transfusion if significant"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), and multiple prior admissions for congestive heart failure exacerbation. She underwent a total hip replacement surgery and experienced post-operative hypoxia, requiring bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). The patient also had two focal motor seizures, treated with ativan, resulting in unresponsiveness but followed by improved mental status. A head CT was negative. She was started on diltiazem for rate control and lasix for fluid management. The patient's allergies include plaquenil, daypro, and atenolol. 

24-hour events include intraoperative transfusion of one liter of packed red blood cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma. Post-operatively, she became tachycardic and hypoxic, requiring BiPAP. She experienced a second seizure treated with ativan, resulting in unresponsiveness but followed by improved mental status. Her head CT was negative, and she received overnight BiPAP, resolving acute metabolic acidosis. She was started on diltiazem with good rate control and received lasix with good urine output, decreasing oxygen requirement.

Medical History:
The patient has a medical history of mechanical fall and hip fracture, admitted to orthopedics, and subsequent surgery. She has allergies to plaquenil, daypro,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9945**] is an 82 yo female with severe chronic diastolic HF, afib
   on coumadin, HTN, moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid
   arthritis, chronic anemia who is s/p hip replacement for mechanical
   fall, now with post-op hypoxia secondary to diastolic CHF.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to diastolic CHF given that she is
   known to have significant diastolic CHF and has had several admissions
   for CHF exacerbations.  She reportedly got only 1L NS in the OR and 2
   units of FFP.  Additionally her post-op pain may have contributed to
   tachycardia and worsening diastolic dysfunction.  CXR consistent with
   acute pulmonary edema.  She has no clear evidence of pneumonia at
   present.  She is know to have pulmonary hypertension. If no improvement
   with rate control and diuresis, consider CTA to evaluate for PE.
   Resolved.
   - Continue Metoprolol and uptitrate as needed.
   - pain control with around the clock tylenol and prn Morphine to avoid
   worsening tachycardia
   - D/C a-line
   - continue home digoxin
   - continue spironolactone
   - Restart lasix 10 mg daily
   .
   2. Seizure.  Family denies history of seizure though patient has a
   keppra allergy suggesting seizure activity at some point.  Her new
   focal motor seizure concerning for focal brain lesion.  At present, not
   stable enough to lay flat for head CT.
   - avoid benzos given how sedated she was after 2 mg of ativan
   - neuro consult in AM re management of focal partial motor seizures???
   .
   3.  S/p hip replacement.  Patient post-op for hip replacement.  Per
   neuro, able to weight bear fully on both legs now.
   - lovenox ppx and coumadin to [**Last Name (un) 9947**] AM
   - pain control with around the clock tylenol and low dose dilaudid
   - ortho following
   - continue fosamax, calcium/ vitamin d for osteoporosis
   .
   4.  A. fib with RVR.  Patient with A. fib with RVR post-operatively
   leading to diastolic CHF exacerbation.
   - Continue BB
   - resume coumadin in AM and cover with prophylactic lovenox while
   awaiting therapeutic INR
   - continue dig
   .
   5. CAD.  Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated without ischemic changes on
   EKG.  Likely secondary to demand.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold BB
   .  .
   6. Rheumatoid arthritis.  Patient is chronically on methotrexate and 5
   mg of prednisone
   - continue methotrexate and prednisone
   - no current indication for stress dose steroids, but low threshold to
   start if hypotensive
   .
   7. Osteoporosis.
   - continue fosamax
   - calcium/ vitamin d

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with severe chronic diastolic HF, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, HTN, moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic anemia who underwent hip replacement surgery and is now experiencing post-operative hypoxia secondary to diastolic CHF. She has a history of several admissions for CHF exacerbations and is known to have significant diastolic dysfunction. The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, tachycardia, and acute pulmonary edema. She also had a seizure episode with focal motor activity, which may be concerning for a focal brain lesion. The patient's current medications include metoprolol, digoxin, spironolactone, lasix, and pain control with around-the-clock tylenol and prn Morphine. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37C (98.6F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/61 to 130/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula, and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and elevated blood glucose level. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in both lungs, mild edema in the left lower extremity, cool extrem"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9945**] is an 82 yo female with severe chronic diastolic HF, afib
   on coumadin, HTN, moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid
   arthritis, chronic anemia who is s/p hip replacement for mechanical
   fall, now with post-op hypoxia secondary to diastolic CHF.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to diastolic CHF given that she is
   known to have significant diastolic CHF and has had several admissions
   for CHF exacerbations.  She reportedly got only 1L NS in the OR and 2
   units of FFP.  Additionally her post-op pain may have contributed to
   tachycardia and worsening diastolic dysfunction.  CXR consistent with
   acute pulmonary edema.  She has no clear evidence of pneumonia at
   present.  She is know to have pulmonary hypertension. If no improvement
   with rate control and diuresis, consider CTA to evaluate for PE.
   Resolved.
   - Continue Metoprolol and uptitrate as needed.
   - pain control with around the clock tylenol and prn Morphine to avoid
   worsening tachycardia
   - D/C a-line
   - continue home digoxin
   - continue spironolactone
   - Restart lasix 10 mg daily

   2. Seizure.  Family denies history of seizure though patient has a
   keppra allergy suggesting seizure activity at some point.  Her new
   focal motor seizure concerning for focal brain lesion.  At present, not
   stable enough to lay flat for head CT.
   - avoid benzos given how sedated she was after 2 mg of ativan
   - neuro consult in AM re management of focal partial motor seizures???

   leading to diastolic CHF exacerbation.
   - Continue BB
   - resume coumadin in AM and cover with prophylactic lovenox while
   awaiting therapeutic INR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with severe chronic diastolic heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hypertension (HTN), moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic anemia, and a history of hip replacement surgery. The patient presented with post-operative hypoxia secondary to diastolic CHF.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Dyspnea: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath likely due to diastolic CHF. This is supported by her known history of significant diastolic CHF and previous admissions for CHF exacerbations. The patient received only 1 liter of normal saline in the operating room and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which may have contributed to fluid overload and worsening diastolic dysfunction. The patient's post-operative pain may also have contributed to tachycardia and worsening diastolic dysfunction. A chest X-ray showed acute pulmonary edema, consistent with the diagnosis of diastolic CHF.

2. Seizure: The patient had a focal motor seizure, which is concerning for a focal brain lesion. However, the patient is currently not stable enough to undergo a head CT scan. The patient has a known allergy to keppra, a medication used to treat seizures.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient has AFib with"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9945**] is an 82 yo female with severe chronic diastolic HF, afib
   on coumadin, HTN, moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid
   arthritis, chronic anemia who is s/p hip replacement for mechanical
   fall, now with post-op hypoxia secondary to diastolic CHF.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to diastolic CHF given that she is
   known to have significant diastolic CHF and has had several admissions
   for CHF exacerbations.  She reportedly got only 1L NS in the OR and 2
   units of FFP.  Additionally her post-op pain may have contributed to
   tachycardia and worsening diastolic dysfunction.  CXR consistent with
   acute pulmonary edema.  She has no clear evidence of pneumonia at
   present.  She is know to have pulmonary hypertension. If no improvement
   with rate control and diuresis, consider CTA to evaluate for PE.
   Resolved.
   - Continue Metoprolol and uptitrate as needed.
   - pain control with around the clock tylenol and prn Morphine to avoid
   worsening tachycardia
   - D/C a-line
   - continue home digoxin
   - continue spironolactone
   - Restart lasix 10 mg daily
   .
   2. Seizure.  Family denies history of seizure though patient has a
   keppra allergy suggesting seizure activity at some point.  Her new
   focal motor seizure concerning for focal brain lesion.  At present, not
   stable enough to lay flat for head CT.
   - avoid benzos given how sedated she was after 2 mg of ativan
   - neuro consult in AM re management of focal partial motor seizures???
   .
   3.  S/p hip replacement.  Patient post-op for hip replacement.  Per
   neuro, able to weight bear fully on both legs now.
   - lovenox ppx and coumadin to [**Last Name (un) 9947**] AM
   - pain control with around the clock tylenol and low dose dilaudid
   - ortho following
   - continue fosamax, calcium/ vitamin d for osteoporosis
   .
   4.  A. fib with RVR.  Patient with A. fib with RVR post-operatively
   leading to diastolic CHF exacerbation.
   - Continue BB
   - resume coumadin in AM and cover with prophylactic lovenox while
   awaiting therapeutic INR
   - continue dig
   .
   5. CAD.  Cardiac enzymes mildly elevated without ischemic changes on
   EKG.  Likely secondary to demand.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold BB
   .  .
   6. Rheumatoid arthritis.  Patient is chronically on methotrexate and 5
   mg of prednisone
   - continue methotrexate and prednisone
   - no current indication for stress dose steroids, but low threshold to
   start if hypotensive
   .
   7. Osteoporosis.
   - continue fosamax

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with severe chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypertension, moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic anemia, who underwent hip replacement surgery and is now experiencing post-operative hypoxia secondary to diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's chief complaints include atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and pulmonary edema. She has been experiencing shortness of breath (SOB) due to diastolic CHF exacerbation, which is likely secondary to tachycardia and worsening diastolic dysfunction. The patient's post-operative pain may have contributed to the tachycardia. A chest X-ray confirms acute pulmonary edema, and there is no clear evidence of pneumonia at present. The patient is known to have pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/61 mmHg to 130/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula, and an atrial fibrillation rhythm.

The patient has undergone several medical interventions, including the administration of medications such as metoprolol, tylenol, morphine, digoxin, spironolactone, and lasix. She has also received en"

","The patient is a 72-year-old female who presented to the hospital with a femoral neck fracture. She was found to have a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic diastolic heart failure, and a seizure disorder. The patient underwent surgery for her hip fracture and was admitted to the ICU post-operatively.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/61mmHg to 130/61mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. She is currently on mechanical ventilation via bipap.

On physical examination, the patient is somnolent but follows simple commands. Her lungs show crackles bilaterally, and she has mild edema in her left lower extremity with a bandage and cool extremities. Neurological examination reveals somnolence and impaired motor function.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, hemoglobin at 8.1 g/dL, sodium at 139 mEq/L, potassium at 4.2 mEq/L, glucose at 112 mg/dL, and creatinine at 1.8 mg/dL. Other lab values are also provided in the note.

The patient has received multiple blood product transfusions and has an ongoing fluid balance deficit of approximately 675 mL since midnight"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with severe chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic anemia. She underwent hip replacement surgery and is now experiencing post-operative hypoxia secondary to diastolic heart failure. The patient has several comorbidities, including congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, coronary artery disease, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation leading to acute pulmonary edema.
2. Focal motor seizure due to a possible focal brain lesion.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobilization post-surgery.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding from stress ulcers.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to endotracheal intubation.
6. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin therapy.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response or ventricular tachycardia.
8. Wound infection at the surgical site.
9. Renal insufficiency or acute kidney injury due to hypotension or nephrotoxic medications.
10. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with severe chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, moderate pulmonary hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic anemia. She underwent hip replacement surgery and is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypoxia secondary to diastolic heart failure. The patient has a history of several admissions for heart failure exacerbations and is known to have significant diastolic heart failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is somnolent and opens her eyes to voice or sternal rub, following simple commands. Physical examination reveals crackles in both lungs bilaterally, cool extremities, and mild edema in the left lower extremity. Neurological examination shows somnolence and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results indicate an increased white blood cell count of 104 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, decreased platelet count of 104 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 39 mg/dL, increased creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, and decreased potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and recent hip fracture. The patient presented with acute pulmonary edema after hip replacement surgery but has shown improvement on minimal cardiac support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Heart Failure (CHF) exacerbation: The patient's severe CHF, likely both systolic and diastolic dysfunction, may lead to worsening heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and decreased cardiac output.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient's AFib is currently better controlled but there is a risk of recurrence, which can result in palpitations, dizziness, and potential complications like stroke.

3. Pulmonary Edema: Although the patient has improved, there is still a risk of recurrent pulmonary edema due to the underlying heart failure. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility after hip replacement surgery, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if dislodged.

5. Delirium: The patient's impaired balance, gait, motor function, knowledge, and transfers indicate potential cognitive impairment, making"
