","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with recurrent follicular cell lymphoma who presented for induction with protocol Ofatumumab/ICE. She was transferred to the ICU for acute mental status changes and fever. The patient is currently experiencing nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. She has a history of recent completion of chemotherapy with known neurotoxicity, and her symptoms may be related to this. There is also a concern for infection, as she has a fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Her chest X-ray shows possible right lower lobe infiltrate, which could indicate pneumonia. Other possible causes of her mental status changes, such as hepatic encephalopathy or meningitis, seem less likely. The patient's laboratory values are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate level. She is receiving methylene blue for possible methemoglobinemia, strict aspiration precautions, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. An MRI and blood cultures are pending, and an EEG may be considered. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Methemoglobinemia: The patient is receiving methylene blue for possible methemoglobinemia, which is a condition where iron in the hemoglobin molecule becomes oxidized to ferric form, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows possible right lower lobe infiltrate, indicating a potential lung infection.
3. Infection: The patient"

   lymphoma admitted 3 days ago for induction chemotherapy

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with recurrent follicular cell lymphoma who presented for induction chemotherapy and was transferred to the ICU for acute mental status changes and suspected [Year (4 digits)] toxicity. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 152/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 2L nasal cannula.

The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, and there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia given her recent emesis event. The chest X-ray initially showed a right lower lobe infiltrate but has since resolved. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, platelet count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and electrolyte levels, but there is an elevated lactate level.

The patient is currently receiving methylene blue for suspected [Year (4 digits)] toxicity, broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired infection and aspiration pneumonia, and antiemetic medication for nausea. The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics pending culture results, monitoring respiratory status, and performing serial arterial blood gas analyses.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent emesis event and altered mental status increase the risk of aspiration, leading to lung infections such as pneumonia.

   # Acute MS changes: Etiology unclear, though concerning for [**Name (NI) 8017**]
   toxicity given recent completion of chemo regimen with known
   neurotoxicity. Infection also likely contributing with fever,
   tachycardia and tachypnea.  CXR with possible RLL infiltrate.  Hepatic
   encephalopathy unlikely given only mild elevation to LFTs. This is very
   unlikely to be meningitis acquired since admission to hospital, will
   hold off on LP for now and d/w neuro.

   event.  Currently tachypneic and febrile though oxygenating well, CXR
   concerning for RLL infiltrate although on f/u CXR today appears to be

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with recurrent follicular cell lymphoma who presented for induction with protocol Ofatumumab/ICE and was transferred to the ICU for acute mental status changes and fever. She has a history of allergies to Demerol (Oral) and nausea/vomiting. She has been receiving multiple medications including Vancomycin, Piperacillin, Famotidine, and methylene blue.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F (38.8°C), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/77 to 169/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with 2L of oxygen. Her weight is 73.6 kg.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for acute mental status changes, nausea, and vomiting. She has undergone various tests including EKG, urine culture, nasal swab, blood cultured, EEG, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Her MRI results are pending read, and she had nausea/vomiting during the MRI, which may have been due to aspiration, as indicated by an improved chest X-ray from the morning.

The patient's lab results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, TCO2, glucose, and electrolyte levels. However, she has an elevated lactate level of"
