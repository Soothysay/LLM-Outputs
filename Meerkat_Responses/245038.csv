   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   33 yoF w/ recently diagnosed thymoma s/p chemo [**7-13**], Afib/flutter w/
   h/o RVR who presents with neutropenic fever and Afib with RVR.
   .
   # sirs in the setting of neutropenia: patient has SIRS criteria of
   fever, leukopenia, and tachycardia as well as suspected infection.
   Lactate 2.0. Not hypotensive currently. Blood cultures sent in ED.
   Source unclear at this time. CXR without evidence of infiltrate.
   Recently placed port. Ddx includes bacteremia, line/port infection,
   UTI, or GI source. Patient is asymptomatic and exam was unrevealing. PE
   is also on ddx, but less likely at this time given fluid
   responsiveness.
   - cont vanco and cefepime per heme/onc recs
   - f/u blood cultures
   - check U/A with culture
   - draw culture from port to eval for line infection
   - IVF (now received total 5L)
   .
   # febrile neutropenia: Neutropenia s/p recent chemo now with fever.
   Unclear source as above.
   - vanco, cefepime
   - consider anaerobic/antifungal coverage if fails to respond to
   antibiotics
   - consider G-CSF if decompensates
   - follow counts
   - neutropenic precautions
   - Ibuprofen for fevers given transaminitis, but be aware of masking
   continued fevers
   - heme/onc recs
   .
   # Afib: RVR in ED. Etiology of Afib thought to be due to tumor
   irritation of pericardium. Current ddx would also include fever,
   tamponade, hypovolemia, sepsis. Most likely, RVR is secondary to
   hypovolemia, given that patient was orthostatic in the ED and with 3L
   IVF, HR on arrival is in 80-90's initially then bumped up to 120's.
   - NSAIDS for fever. Avoiding Tylenol given transaminitis
   - volume replete with NS, giving an additional liter now
   - monitor UOP, keep >35cc/hr
   - treat infection as above
   - rate control beta blocker, digoxin, but hold beta blocker till
   morning given to effectively volume replete first
   - repeat ECHO if HR is fluid unresponsive. If hypotensive, may require
   stat ECHO. No evidence of tamponade on exam currently
   - CHADS score of 0. No need for systemic anticoag.
   .
   # chest pain: patient has had chest pain. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to mediastinal
   mass or recent biopsy. Possible contribution of pericardial
   inflammation from mass. Unlikely ischemia.
   - cont pain control with Oxycontin
   - oxycodone prn
   .
   # anemia: Current Hct consistent with prior values during recent
   admission. TSH, B12, folate nl. Retic was 1.8% in setting of anemia
   suggesting poor erythropoiesis. Currently no suggestion of hemolysis
   with low normal K, Tbili of 0.7. Ddx includes myelosuppression,
   thymoma/MDS(pure red cell aplasia), GI source.
   - T+S.
   - repeat CBC in am
   - add on LDH although low suspicion of hemolysis
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: new drop in platelets. Suspect [**1-25**] myelosuppression
   from chemotherapy.
   - trend platelets
   - transfuse for plts<10 unless evidence of bleeding
   .
   # transaminitis: LFTs c/w recent values. Per liver c/s, ddx includes
   congetive, autoimmune, drug induced. Hepatitis serologies were
   negative. Hemochromatosis ruled out by Fe/TIBC < 45. TSH normal. GGT
   significantly elevated suggesting possible biliary process. RUQ u/s
   showed only cholelithiasis. Anti-smooth muscle negative. IgG normal.
   Mitochondrial M2 IgG normal. Ceruloplasmin normal. TTG-IgA was normal.
   Had liver bx at OSH which was unrevealing. Liver had also recommended
   checking LKM-1, [**Doctor First Name **], AMA Abs to r/o autoimmune hepatitis but cannot
   find record of those in system.
   - trend LFTs
   - avoiding tylenol
   .
   # B1 Thymoma: s/p her 1st course of chemo on [**7-13**] including
   cyclophosphomide, doxurubicin, cisplatin. The plan for her is
   chemo-radiation and then surgical intervention. B1 thymoma has a good
   prognosis and Rx is curative.
   - supportive care with antiemetics, ativan, pain control
   - heme/onc recs
   .
   # FEN: regular diet with neutropenic precautions
   .
   # PPx: hold heparin sc given thrombocytopenia, use pneumoboots.
   aggressive bowel regimen on narcotics.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV. Port
   .
   # CODE: FULL
   .
   # DISP: pending above

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a recently diagnosed thymoma who has undergone chemotherapy. She presents with neutropenic fever and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/68 to 94/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%.

The patient has a history of right ventricular overload and presents with suspected infection, as evidenced by SIRS criteria of fever, leukopenia, and tachycardia. Lactate levels are elevated at 2.0, indicating possible tissue hypoperfusion. The patient's blood cultures were sent in the emergency department, but the source of infection remains unclear. A chest X-ray shows no evidence of infiltrate, and the patient has recently had a port placed. Differential diagnoses include bacteremia, line/port infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), or gastrointestinal (GI) source.

The patient is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime, and further investigations include checking urine analysis with culture and drawing culture from the port to evaluate for line infection. Intravenous fluids have been given, totaling 3,634 mL, with an output of 900 mL of urine. The patient is also receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen.

In addition to the suspected infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a recently diagnosed thymoma who has been treated with chemotherapy. She presents with neutropenic fever, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and suspected infection. She also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and transaminitis. She is currently receiving antibiotics and supportive care, and further investigations are ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's neutropenic fever and suspected infection, there is a risk of developing sepsis if the infection spreads or if the antibiotics are not effective.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib/RVR): The patient's AFib/RVR may lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure if left untreated or uncontrolled.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, particularly if invasive procedures or surgery are required.
4. Transaminitis: The elevated liver enzymes indicate liver dysfunction, which may progress to hepatitis or cirrhosis if not managed appropriately.
5. Thymoma: The patient's thymoma, if left untreated, can progress and cause complications such as respiratory distress or cardiac tamponade.
6. Chemotherapy-related complications: The patient's ongoing chemotherapy treatment may lead to additional side effects, such as myelosuppression, mucositis, or renal toxicity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of thymoma who presented with neutropenic fever and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been experiencing nausea and vomiting overnight, vague chest pain different from her usual pain related to her thymoma, and intolerance to oxycontin/oxycodone due to nausea. She was given morphine with some relief. The patient continues to have tachycardia and fevers in the range of 101 F. Metoprolol 5 mg IV q6hrs has been helping to decrease her heart rate to the 90s-100s. The heme/onc team is following and the patient has ongoing chemotherapy and radiation plans.

Medical Complications:
1. SIRS in the setting of neutropenia: The patient has SIRS criteria of fever, leukopenia, and tachycardia as well as suspected infection. Lactate is 2.0, not hypotensive currently, and blood cultures were sent in the ED. Source unclear at this time. CXR without evidence of infiltrate. Ddx includes bacteremia, line/port infection, UTI, or GI source.
2. Febrile neutropenia: Neutropenia s/p recent chemo now with fever. Unclear source as above. Continuing vancomycin and cefepime per heme/onc recs.

   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had some nausea and vomiting overnight. Amylase and Lipase were
   WNL. She also had a new, vague chest pain which she states is different
   than her usual pain related to her thymoma. She was unable to tolerate
   oxycontin/oxycodone due to nausea and was given morphine instead with
   some relief. Psychiatry felt Remeron would be a good medication as it
   is an appetite stimulant as well as an anti-anxiety /anti-depressant
   medication for her.
   She continues to have some tachycardia and fevers in 101 F range.

   Neutropenic Fevers,  thymoma
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient had some nausea and vomiting overnight. Amylase and Lipase were
   WNL. She also had a new, vague chest pain which she states is different
   than her usual pain related to her thymoma. She was unable to tolerate
   oxycontin/oxycodone due to nausea and was given morphine instead with
   some relief. Psychiatry felt Remeron would be a good medication as it
   is an appetite stimulant as well as an anti-anxiety /anti-depressant
   medication for her.  Patient has had some anxiety relief with PRN
   Ativan as well which began yesturday .
   She continues to have some tachycardia and fevers in 101 F range.

   Assessment and Plan:
   33 yoF w/ recently diagnosed thymoma s/p chemo [**7-13**], Afib/flutter w/
   h/o RVR who presents with neutropenic fever and Afib with RVR.
   .
   #SIRS in the setting of neutropenia: patient has SIRS criteria of
   fever, leukopenia, and tachycardia as well as suspected infection.
   Lactate 2.0 on admission. Non- hypotensive but issues with tachycardia
   continuing now. Blood cultures unremarkable to date.  Source still
   unclear at this time. CXR without evidence of infiltrate, port site is
   clean, nonerythematous on PE. Ddx includes bacteremia, line/port
   infection, UTI, or GI source
   - Will continue vancomycin and cefepime per heme/onc recs
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cxs
   - continue gentle IVFs
   .
   # febrile neutropenia: improving WBC trend since admission with wbc
   count up to 1.5 today from .6 yesturday. Nadir s/p chemo on [**7-13**] has
   hopefully passed, will continue to trend daily cbc/ANC.  Fevers persist
   in 101 ranges now.
   - continue vancomycin , cefepime
   - consider anaerobic/antifungal coverage if fails to respond to
   antibiotics and febrile x4-5days
   - consider G-CSF if decompensates
   - follow counts
   - neutropenic precautions
   - Ibuprofen for fevers (not tylenol) given transaminitis, but be aware
   of masking continued fevers
   - heme/onc recs
   .
   # Afib: RVR in ED. Etiology of Afib thought to be due to tumor
   irritation of pericardium. Current ddx would also include fever,
   tamponade, hypovolemia, sepsis. Most likely, RVR is secondary to
   hypovolemia, given that patient was orthostatic in the ED and with 3L
   IVF, HR on arrival is in 80-90's initially then bumped up to 120's and
   still having tachycardia
   - volume replete with NS for goal UOP >35cc/hr
   - continue rate control with beta blocker
IV titrated lopressor and
   digoxin.
   - CHADS score of 0. No need for systemic anticoagulation at this
   juncture, also thrombocytopenic
   .
   # chest pain: patient has had chest pain. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to mediastinal
   mass or recent biopsy. Possible contribution of pericardial
   inflammation from mass. Unlikely ischemia. Will continue to control
   pain  with morphine PRN
   .
   # anemia: Current Hct consistent with prior values during recent
   admission. TSH, B12, folate nl. Retic was 1.8% in setting of anemia
   suggesting poor erythropoiesis. Currently no suggestion of hemolysis
   with low normal K, Tbili of 0.7. Ddx includes myelosuppression,
   thymoma/MDS(pure red cell aplasia), GI source.  Mainly a drop 2/2
   recent chemo.
   - T+S active, following daily CBC trends, will plan to transfuse for
   Hct below 21%
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: likely [**1-25**] myelosuppression from chemotherapy [**7-13**],
   will trend platelets and
   - transfuse for plts<10 unless evidence of bleeding
   .
   # transaminitis: LFTs c/w recent values. Per liver c/s, ddx includes
   congetive, autoimmune, drug induced. Hepatitis serologies were
   negative. Hemochromatosis ruled out by Fe/TIBC < 45. TSH normal. GGT
   significantly elevated suggesting possible biliary process. RUQ u/s
   showed only cholelithiasis. Anti-smooth muscle negative. IgG normal.
   Mitochondrial M2 IgG normal. Ceruloplasmin normal. TTG-IgA was normal.
   Had liver bx at OSH which was unrevealing. Liver had also recommended
   checking LKM-1, [**Doctor First Name **], AMA Abs to r/o autoimmune hepatitis but cannot
   find record of those in system.
   - trend LFTs
   - avoiding tylenol
   .
   # B1 Thymoma: s/p her 1st course of chemo on [**7-13**] including
   cyclophosphomide, doxurubicin, cisplatin. The plan for her is to
   stabilize in [**Hospital 1025**] transfer to Omed  and make plan for her continuing
   chemo-radiation and then surgical intervention. B1 thymoma has a good
   prognosis and Rx is curative.
   -will continue supportive care with antiemetics (Zofran), ativan, pain
   control
   - actively following heme/onc recs
   .
   # FEN: regular diet with neutropenic precautions
   .
   # PPx: hold heparin sc given thrombocytopenia, use pneumoboots.
   aggressive bowel regimen on narcotics.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV. Left subclavicular Port

   # CODE: FULL
   .
   # DISP: ICU for now, stabilize cardiac issues and fevers/identify any
   possible sources infection

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of thymoma, currently in the ICU for management of complications related to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. She has been experiencing nausea and vomiting overnight, along with new-onset chest pain that is different from her usual pain associated with thymoma. The patient has been unable to tolerate oxycontin/oxycodone due to nausea and was given morphine instead, which provided some relief. Psychiatry recommended the use of Remeron, an appetite stimulant as well as an anti-anxiety/anti-depressant medication. The patient continues to have tachycardia and fevers in the range of 101 F, but metoprolol has helped to decrease her heart rate to the 90s-100s. The heme/onc team is following and making plans for ongoing chemotherapy and radiation.

Medical Complications:
1. Nausea and vomiting: This can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential aspiration pneumonia if the patient's gag reflex is compromised.
2. Chest pain: This could be indicative of various conditions such as myocardial infarction, pleurisy, or worsening thymoma.
3. Tachycardia and fever: These symptoms may suggest an infection, sepsis, or other inflammatory processes.
4. Allergies: The patient has documented allergies to sulfa medications, which should be taken into consideration when prescribing antibiotics or other medications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and a new type of chest pain that is different from the pain related to her thymoma. She has been unable to tolerate oxycontin/oxycodone due to nausea and was given morphine with some relief. Psychiatry suggested adding Remeron as an appetite stimulant and anti-anxiety/depressant medication.

The patient's allergies include sulfa medications, which can cause rash and hives. She has been receiving various medications such as lorazepam, morphine sulfate, metoprolol, and others for different purposes.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit), elevated heart rate of 111 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 105/59 mmHg to 121/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 5410 mL and output of 3500 mL, with a negative balance of 1910 mL. Blood products totaling 3500 mL were given, and urine output was 3500 mL as well. No information is provided about NG or drain outputs.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/d"

   4. chest pain
   33F with thymoma, presents with neutropenic fever, afib with rvr.
   Fevers persist though fever curve down somewhat.
   Pt does have persistent intermittent tachycardia, in part because she
   was not able to tolerate some po meds. Will restart metoprolol po every
   6 hours and use metoprolol iv as needed. Will continue digoxin and
   repeat level tomorrow morning. Will also continue with IV fluids,
   additional 1-2 liters NS today.
   Will discuss with oncology whether we need to expand coverage given
   persistent fever. All counts are improving.
   Patient's mood is improving; appreciate recommendations from
   psychiatry.
   As patient is stating to tolerate POs better, she should be able to
   take PO metoprolol. Once rate control improved, she should be able to
   got to the floor.

   33F with thymoma, presents with neutropenic fever, afib with rvr.
   Fevers persist though fever curve down somewhat.
   Pt does have persistent intermittent tachycardia, in part because she
   was not able to tolerate some po meds. Will restart metoprolol po every
   6 hours and use metoprolol iv as needed. Will continue digoxin and
   repeat level tomorrow morning. Will also continue with IV fluids,
   additional 1-2 liters NS today.
   Will discuss with oncology whether we need to expand coverage given
   persistent fever. All counts are improving.
   Patient's mood is improving; appreciate recommendations from
   psychiatry. However, the patient is very sleepy. Will stop the ativan.
   Hct up a bit. No need for transfusion now.
   As patient is stating to tolerate POs better, she should be able to
   take PO metoprolol. Once rate control improved, she should be able to
   got to the floor.

   .
   #SIRS in the setting of neutropenia: patient has SIRS criteria of
   fever, leukopenia, and tachycardia as well as suspected infection.
   Lactate 2.0 on admission. Non- hypotensive but issues with tachycardia
   continuing now. Blood cultures unremarkable to date.  Source still
   unclear at this time. CXR without evidence of infiltrate, port site is
   clean, nonerythematous on PE. Ddx includes bacteremia, line/port
   infection.  UTI r/o with normal labs and  GI source unlikely as no
   diarrhea or abdominal pain.
   - Will continue vancomycin and cefepime per heme/onc recs, holding off
   on antifungals for now
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cxs, throat cx and consider ENT consult for
   new H&N exam compaints of tooth/submandibular pain on right side and
   erythematous throat and pt c/o sore throat with swallowing. Will also
   start Nystatin S& S alongside miracle mouthwash.
   .
   # febrile neutropenia: improving WBC trend since admission with wbc
   count up to 1.5 today from .6  2 days ago . Nadir s/p chemo on [**7-13**] has
   hopefully passed, will continue to trend daily cbc/ANC.  Fevers persist
   in 101-102 ranges now.   CIS daily
   - continue vancomycin , cefepime
   - consider anaerobic/antifungal coverage if fails to respond to
   antibiotics and febrile x4-5days
   - consider G-CSF if decompensates
   - con
t  neutropenic precautions
   - Ibuprofen for fevers (not tylenol) given transaminitis, but be aware
   of masking continued fevers
   - follow heme/onc recs
   .
   # Afib: RVR in ED. Etiology of Afib thought to be due to tumor
   irritation of pericardium. Current ddx would also include fever,
   tamponade, hypovolemia, sepsis. Most likely, RVR is secondary to
   hypovolemia, given that patient was orthostatic in the ED and with 3L
   IVF, HR on arrival is in 80-90's initially then bumped up to 120's and
   still having tachycardia now
 probably due to tumor
   irritation/mechanical etiology. Will volume replete with NS for goal
   UOP >35cc/hr
   - continue rate control with beta blocker and digoxin
IV titrated
   lopressor and digoxin, Dig level low today will re-check in a.m.
   - Low CHADS score no need for systemic anticoagulation at this juncture
   # chest pain: patient has had chest pain. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to mediastinal
   mass or recent biopsy. Possible contribution of pericardial
   inflammation from mass. Unlikely ischemia. Will continue to control
   pain  with morphine PRN
   .
   # anemia: Current Hct consistent with prior values during recent
   admission. TSH, B12, folate nl. Retic was 1.8% in setting of anemia
   suggesting poor erythropoiesis. Currently no suggestion of hemolysis
   with low normal K, Tbili of 0.7. Ddx includes myelosuppression,
   thymoma/MDS(pure red cell aplasia), GI source.  Mainly a drop 2/2
   recent chemo.
   - T+S active, following daily CBC trends, will plan to transfuse for
   Hct below 21%
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: resolved, probably [**1-25**] myelosuppression from
   chemotherapy [**7-13**], today Plts 170s.
   # Anxiety
 psych consult appreciated, patient to continue on Remeron
   and Ativan PRN for relief
   .
   # transaminitis: LFTs c/w recent values. Per liver c/s, ddx includes
   congetive, autoimmune, drug induced. Hepatitis serologies were
   negative. Hemochromatosis ruled out by Fe/TIBC < 45. TSH normal. GGT
   significantly elevated suggesting possible biliary process. RUQ u/s
   showed only cholelithiasis. Anti-smooth muscle negative. IgG normal.
   Mitochondrial M2 IgG normal. Ceruloplasmin normal. TTG-IgA was normal.
   Had liver bx at OSH which was unrevealing..
   - trend LFTs
   - avoiding tylenol
   .
   # B1 Thymoma: s/p her 1st course of chemo on [**7-13**] including
   cyclophosphomide, doxurubicin, cisplatin. The plan for her is to
   stabilize in [**Hospital 1025**] transfer to Omed  and make plan for her continuing
   chemo-radiation and then surgical intervention. B1 thymoma has a good
   prognosis and Rx is curative.
   -will continue supportive care with antiemetics (Zofran), ativan, pain
   control
   - actively following heme/onc recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of thymoma, who presented with neutropenic fever and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on antibiotics for suspected bacteremia or line infection. Her WBC count has improved from 0.6 to 1.5 today. She continues to have fevers ranging from 101-102 degrees Fahrenheit and is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. The source of infection is still unclear, with blood cultures being unremarkable so far. She also has a peritonsillar abscess and right lower jaw/submandibular tenderness, for which she is being started on miracle mouthwash and an updated mouthcare regimen. 

The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is believed to be secondary to tumor irritation of the pericardium or mechanical etiology. She is being volume-repleted with normal saline and her heart rate is being controlled with a beta-blocker and digoxin. Her chest pain is thought to be due to a mediastinal mass or recent biopsy, possible contribution of pericardial inflammation from the mass. 

The patient has anemia with a Hct of 21.3%, which is consistent with prior values during her recent admission. Her reticulocyte count was 1.8%, suggesting poor erythropoiesis. There"

   Assessment and Plan:
   33 yoF w/ recently diagnosed thymoma s/p chemo [**7-13**], Afib/flutter w/
   h/o RVR who presents with neutropenic fever and Afib with RVR.
   .
   #SIRS in the setting of neutropenia: patient has SIRS criteria of
   fever, leukopenia, and tachycardia as well as suspected infection.
   Lactate 2.0 on admission. Non- hypotensive but issues with tachycardia
   continuing now. Blood cultures unremarkable to date.  Source still
   unclear at this time. CXR without evidence of infiltrate, port site is
   clean, nonerythematous on PE. Ddx includes bacteremia, line/port
   infection, UTI, or GI source
   - Will continue vancomycin and cefepime per heme/onc recs
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cxs
   - continue gentle IVFs
   .
   # febrile neutropenia: improving WBC trend since admission with wbc
   count up to 1.5 today from .6 yesturday. Nadir s/p chemo on [**7-13**] has
   hopefully passed, will continue to trend daily cbc/ANC.  Fevers persist
   in 101 ranges now.
   - continue vancomycin , cefepime
   - consider anaerobic/antifungal coverage if fails to respond to
   antibiotics and febrile x4-5days
   - consider G-CSF if decompensates
   - follow counts
   - neutropenic precautions
   - Ibuprofen for fevers (not tylenol) given transaminitis, but be aware
   of masking continued fevers
   - heme/onc recs
   .
   # Afib: RVR in ED. Etiology of Afib thought to be due to tumor
   irritation of pericardium. Current ddx would also include fever,
   tamponade, hypovolemia, sepsis. Most likely, RVR is secondary to
   hypovolemia, given that patient was orthostatic in the ED and with 3L
   IVF, HR on arrival is in 80-90's initially then bumped up to 120's and
   still having tachycardia
   - volume replete with NS for goal UOP >35cc/hr
   - continue rate control with beta blocker
IV titrated lopressor and
   digoxin.
   - CHADS score of 0. No need for systemic anticoagulation at this
   juncture, also thrombocytopenic
   .
   # chest pain: patient has had chest pain. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to mediastinal
   mass or recent biopsy. Possible contribution of pericardial
   inflammation from mass. Unlikely ischemia. Will continue to control
   pain  with morphine PRN
   .
   # anemia: Current Hct consistent with prior values during recent
   admission. TSH, B12, folate nl. Retic was 1.8% in setting of anemia
   suggesting poor erythropoiesis. Currently no suggestion of hemolysis
   with low normal K, Tbili of 0.7. Ddx includes myelosuppression,
   thymoma/MDS(pure red cell aplasia), GI source.  Mainly a drop 2/2
   recent chemo.
   - T+S active, following daily CBC trends, will plan to transfuse for
   Hct below 21%
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: likely [**1-25**] myelosuppression from chemotherapy [**7-13**],
   will trend platelets and
   - transfuse for plts<10 unless evidence of bleeding
   .
   # transaminitis: LFTs c/w recent values. Per liver c/s, ddx includes
   congetive, autoimmune, drug induced. Hepatitis serologies were
   negative. Hemochromatosis ruled out by Fe/TIBC < 45. TSH normal. GGT
   significantly elevated suggesting possible biliary process. RUQ u/s
   showed only cholelithiasis. Anti-smooth muscle negative. IgG normal.
   Mitochondrial M2 IgG normal. Ceruloplasmin normal. TTG-IgA was normal.
   Had liver bx at OSH which was unrevealing. Liver had also recommended
   checking LKM-1, [**Doctor First Name **], AMA Abs to r/o autoimmune hepatitis but cannot
   find record of those in system.
   - trend LFTs
   - avoiding tylenol
   .
   # B1 Thymoma: s/p her 1st course of chemo on [**7-13**] including
   cyclophosphomide, doxurubicin, cisplatin. The plan for her is to
   stabilize in [**Hospital 1025**] transfer to Omed  and make plan for her continuing
   chemo-radiation and then surgical intervention. B1 thymoma has a good
   prognosis and Rx is curative.
   -will continue supportive care with antiemetics (Zofran), ativan, pain
   control
   - actively following heme/onc recs
   .
   # FEN: regular diet with neutropenic precautions
   .
   # PPx: hold heparin sc given thrombocytopenia, use pneumoboots.
   aggressive bowel regimen on narcotics.
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV. Left subclavicular Port
   .
   # CODE: FULL
   .
   # DISP: ICU for now, stabilize cardiac issues and fevers/identify any
   possible sources infection
   .
   # Comm: sister, [**Name (NI) **] is HCP. Also mother and older sister involved in
   care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old female with a history of thymoma, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR), and recent chemotherapy, presenting with neutropenic fever of unknown origin. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 103.2°F, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 89/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient has been febrile and tolerating oral feeding, with an improved mood and better-controlled heart rate. Allergies to sulfa medications and previous antibiotic use have been noted. The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged except for the presenting complaint. Physical examination findings include normocephalic head, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds with a few rales at the bases, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Lab results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 63 K/uL. Imaging studies have not revealed any new findings. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Neutropenic fever
2. Thymoma

   # febrile neutropenia: improving WBC trend since admission with wbc
   count up to 1.5 today from .6  2 days ago . Nadir s/p chemo on [**7-13**] has
   hopefully passed, will continue to trend daily cbc/ANC.  Fevers persist
   in 101-102 ranges now.   CIS daily
   - continue vancomycin , cefepime
   - consider anaerobic/antifungal coverage if fails to respond to
   antibiotics and febrile x4-5days
   - consider G-CSF if decompensates
   - con
t  neutropenic precautions
   - Ibuprofen for fevers (not tylenol) given transaminitis, but be aware
   of masking continued fevers
   - follow heme/onc recs
   .
   # Afib: RVR in ED. Etiology of Afib thought to be due to tumor
   irritation of pericardium. Current ddx would also include fever,
   tamponade, hypovolemia, sepsis. Most likely, RVR is secondary to
   hypovolemia, given that patient was orthostatic in the ED and with 3L
   IVF, HR on arrival is in 80-90's initially then bumped up to 120's and
   still having tachycardia now
 probably due to tumor
   irritation/mechanical etiology. Will volume replete with NS for goal
   UOP >35cc/hr
   - continue rate control with beta blocker and digoxin
IV titrated
   lopressor and digoxin, Dig level low today will re-check in a.m.
   - Low CHADS score no need for systemic anticoagulation at this juncture
   # chest pain: patient has had chest pain. [**Month (only) 51**] be due to mediastinal
   mass or recent biopsy. Possible contribution of pericardial
   inflammation from mass. Unlikely ischemia. Will continue to control
   pain  with morphine PRN
   .
   # anemia: Current Hct consistent with prior values during recent
   admission. TSH, B12, folate nl. Retic was 1.8% in setting of anemia
   suggesting poor erythropoiesis. Currently no suggestion of hemolysis
   with low normal K, Tbili of 0.7. Ddx includes myelosuppression,
   thymoma/MDS(pure red cell aplasia), GI source.  Mainly a drop 2/2
   recent chemo.
   - T+S active, following daily CBC trends, will plan to transfuse for
   Hct below 21%
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: resolved, probably [**1-25**] myelosuppression from
   chemotherapy [**7-13**], today Plts 170s.
   # Anxiety
 psych consult appreciated, patient to continue on Remeron
   and Ativan PRN for relief
   .
   # transaminitis: LFTs c/w recent values. Per liver c/s, ddx includes
   congetive, autoimmune, drug induced. Hepatitis serologies were
   negative. Hemochromatosis ruled out by Fe/TIBC < 45. TSH normal. GGT
   significantly elevated suggesting possible biliary process. RUQ u/s
   showed only cholelithiasis. Anti-smooth muscle negative. IgG normal.
   Mitochondrial M2 IgG normal. Ceruloplasmin normal. TTG-IgA was normal.
   Had liver bx at OSH which was unrevealing..
   - trend LFTs
   - avoiding tylenol
   .
   # B1 Thymoma: s/p her 1st course of chemo on [**7-13**] including
   cyclophosphomide, doxurubicin, cisplatin. The plan for her is to
   stabilize in [**Hospital 1025**] transfer to Omed  and make plan for her continuing
   chemo-radiation and then surgical intervention. B1 thymoma has a good
   prognosis and Rx is curative.
   -will continue supportive care with antiemetics (Zofran), ativan, pain

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old female with a recently diagnosed thymoma who underwent chemotherapy on [**7-13**]. She presented with neutropenic fever and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR). The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including febrile neutropenia, atrial fibrillation, chest pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia, anxiety, transaminitis, and B1 thymoma.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 39.3°C (102.7°F), blood pressure ranging from 99/50 mmHg to 107/62 mmHg, heart rate between 112 and 151 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 63. The liver function tests indicate transaminitis, and the coagulation profile shows a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and an elevated international normalized ratio (INR).

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   33 yoF w/ recently diagnosed thymoma s/p chemo [**7-13**], Afib/flutter w/
   h/o RVR who presents with neutropenic fever and Afib with RVR.
   .
   #SIRS in the setting of neutropenia: patient has SIRS criteria of
   fever, leukopenia, and tachycardia as well as suspected infection.
   Lactate 2.0 on admission. Non- hypotensive but issues with tachycardia
   continuing now. Blood cultures unremarkable to date.  Source still
   unclear at this time. CXR without evidence of infiltrate, port site is
   clean, nonerythematous on PE. Ddx includes bacteremia, line/port
   infection.  UTI r/o with normal labs and  GI source unlikely as no
   diarrhea or abdominal pain.
   - Will continue vancomycin and cefepime per heme/onc recs, holding off
   on antifungals for now
   - Continue Nystatin S& S alongside miracle mouthwash for likely oral
   thrush. F/u blood cultures, urine cxs, throat cx, and final read of
   Neck CT. If CT neg for abscess, consider dental consult after panorex
   films.
   # Fever with resolved neutropenia: improving WBC trend since admission
   with wbc count up to 4.5 today from .6  3 days ago . Nadir s/p chemo on
   [**7-13**] has hopefully passed, will continue to trend daily cbc/ANC.  Last
   fever spike 8 AM yesterday ([**2172-7-26**])
   - continue vancomycin , cefepime
   - consider anaerobic/antifungal coverage if fails to respond to
   antibiotics and spikes fever again
   - consider G-CSF if decompensates
   - D/C neutropenia precautions
   - Ibuprofen for fevers (not tylenol) given transaminitis, but be aware
   of masking continued fevers
   - follow heme/onc recs

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Afib
   2) Tachycardia
   3) fever
   Heart rate under better control. Patient denies palpitations.
   Fever persists, although patient no longer neutropenic. No clear site
   of infection. Continues on antibiotics.
   Maintain positive fluid balance with fevers and borderline low blood
   pressure.
   Anemia persists although other blood counts have returned to [**Location 810**].
   No need for transfusion now.

   Total time spent: 30 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and complications that can arise. These include:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing episodes of AFib, which is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of blood clots and stroke.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently elevated, with a range of 85-151 beats per minute. Tachycardia can be a sign of underlying infection, stress, or other cardiac conditions.

3. Fever: The patient has had a persistent fever, with a temperature of 102.7°F last night. Fever can be an indication of an infection or inflammation in the body.

4. Hypotension: The patient experienced a transient drop in blood pressure, which required fluid resuscitation. Hypotension can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs and may indicate septic shock or other circulatory issues.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been low at times, indicating thrombocytopenia. This condition increases the risk of bleeding and clotting disorders.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a low hemoglobin level. Anemia can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.

7. Infection: Although no clear site of infection is identified, the patient's persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection."
