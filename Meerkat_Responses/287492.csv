   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. The patient felt reasonably well throughout the day but required non-invasive ventilation from 09:00 AM to 11:00 AM. Blood cultures, urine culture, and nasal swab were collected at 11:13 AM. 

The patient has no known drug allergies and there are no updates regarding their medical or family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent events.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius (98 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate ranging from 65 to 135 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/47 to 141/84 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 15 to 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 30 mL total fluids, with no input through the gastrointestinal tract. The output includes 1,267 mL of urine and 260 mL of blood products. The respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 759 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 14 cmH2O, and a SpO2 of 95%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 36 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 29 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of 2 mEq/L, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 308.

The physical examination reveals normal general appearance, warm and dry skin, eyes moving to all fields with pupils reactive and round, supple neck with no masses or jugular venous distention (JVD), irregularly irregular heart rhythm with tachycardia, decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields without wheezes or rhonchi, soft abdomen with no tenderness, warm and dry extremities with good distal pulses, and normal neurologic examination.

The lab results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 19.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 36.0%, platelet (Plt) count of 205 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.2 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 26 mg/dL, glucose level of 147 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

The patient's chronic condition is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), specifically bronchitis and emphysema, with an acute exacerbation."

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   A/P: 83 y/o male with A-fib, CAD, HTN, and COPD (on intermittent oxygen
   at home) who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening SOB, admitted
   for COPD exacerbation on prednisone burst but now with increasing WOB
   and A. Fib with RVR.
   .
   # Acute respiratory distress: Hemodynamics would suggest pulmonary
   edema but no overt evidence of volume overload by CXR.  History and
   exam more c/w COPD flare given wheezing, limited air movement and chest
   x-ray but no reported change in sputum production or increased cough.
   Patient has limited reserve with FEV1 40% of predicted and in setting
   of pneumonia may decompensate.  PE unlikely given INR.  No e/o
   aspiration by history or CXR.
   - Trial of CPAP now and repeat ABG on CPAP
   - Steroid burst today with solumedrol 100mg IV x1, redose PRN with plan
   for prednisone 60mg to start in the AM.
   - continue levaquin
   - check CE's, ECG, BNP
   - standing levalbuterol nebulizers, tiotropium
   - increase flutic/salmeterol PRN
   - sputum culture
   - continue vitamin D, calcium
   - consider sending viral screen
   .
   # Afib: A. Fib with RVR.  Appears to be secondary process in setting of
   acute respiratory distress.  Will undergo trial of cpap and if HR does
   not improve will attempt diltiazem gtt.
   - continue rate control with CCB, dilt gtt prn
   - cotninue anticoagulation with coumadin
   - unclear if patient needs full dose aspirin and therapeutic warfarin.
   - hold coumadin dose 1x now for supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pan culture.  Likely [**1-9**] to steroids but in setting of
   decompensation would eval for occult infection.
   .
   # CAD/hypercholesterolemia: No chest pain or other clinical history to
   suggets active ischemia. EKG with no e/o ischemia
   - continue home meds
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue home meds
   .
   # BPH: continue outpatient medications, place foley.
   .
   # FEN - cardiac healthy diet
   # PPx - AC with coumadin, bactrim for PCP prophylaxis, PPI
   # Access - PIV
   # Code - FULL CODE but would not want prolonged life support
   # Dispo - call out to floor once stable off CPAP

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (A-fib), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and bronchitis. He presented to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath and was admitted for a COPD exacerbation. The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory distress, and hemodynamics suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. However, there is no evidence of volume overload on the chest X-ray. The patient's limited air movement and wheezing are consistent with a COPD flare. He has limited lung reserve with an FEV1 of 40% of predicted and may decompensate in the setting of pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient's symptoms of worsening shortness of breath and limited air movement suggest acute respiratory distress. This could be due to a COPD exacerbation or pulmonary edema. Close monitoring and intervention, such as CPAP therapy, are necessary.
2. Pulmonary Edema: Hemodynamics indicate the possibility of pulmonary edema, but this is not confirmed by chest X-ray. Further evaluation and management are needed to prevent respiratory failure.
3. Infection: Leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) suggests a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been started. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening infection and"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 83 y/o male with A-fib, CAD, HTN, and COPD (on intermittent oxygen
   at home) who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening SOB, admitted
   for COPD exacerbation on prednisone burst. Transferred to ICU due
   increased WOB, tachycardia and A fib with RVR.
   .
   # Acute respiratory distress: Hemodynamics would suggest pulmonary
   edema but no overt evidence of volume overload by CXR.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   exacerbation of COPD although could also be cardiogenic in nature as
   episodes of SOB correspond with increased HR and BP. Patient has
   limited reserve with FEV1 40% of predicted and in setting of pneumonia
   may decompensate.  PE unlikely given INR.  No e/o aspiration by history
   or CXR. Another episode of acute on chronic SOB this morning. Per floor
   team who knew him well prior to transfer to ICU, pt tends to become
   more dyspneic in mornings and actually uses O2 at home only in the
   mornings. A fib with RVR may be precipitating these acute episodes and
   perpetuating symptoms.
   - Dilt 10 mg IV now, and start 30 mg QID, then titrate up as tolerated
   (Pt on 240mg Qdaily at home)
   - Levalbuterol already given, pt reports no benefit.
   - CXR now
   - CPAP trial, repeat ABG; wean off as tolerated. If pt requires CPAP
   again, would place an A-line for closer monitoring and frequent ABG
   checks.
   - Continue prednisone 60mg, levaquin
   - check CE's this am (1^st set neg)
   - standing levalbuterol nebulizers, tiotropium

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath. He was admitted for a COPD exacerbation and started on prednisone therapy. Due to increased work of breathing, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the patient was transferred to the ICU.

The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory distress with hemodynamics suggestive of pulmonary edema but no overt evidence of volume overload on chest X-ray. There is a possibility that this exacerbation could be cardiogenic in nature, considering episodes of shortness of breath correspond with increased heart rate and blood pressure. The patient's limited lung reserve, with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40% of predicted, may lead to decompensation in the setting of pneumonia.

A pulmonary embolism is unlikely given the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) value. There is no evidence of aspiration by history or chest X-ray. The patient has experienced another episode of acute-on-chronic shortness of breath this morning. The patient tends to become more dyspneic in the mornings and uses oxygen at home only during that time. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may be precipitating these acute episodes and perpetuating symptoms.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (A-fib), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and was admitted for a COPD exacerbation. Due to increased work of breathing, tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory distress, possibly exacerbated by pulmonary edema or cardiogenic causes. His limited lung reserve and recent pneumonia increase the risk of decompensation. The patient also has leukocytosis and is pan-cultured, suggesting a possible infection. Other medical issues include increased BUN:Cr ratio likely due to dehydration and steroid administration, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular disease (CAD).

Plan:
- Administer diltiazem 10 mg IV and start 30 mg QID to control heart rate.
- Provide levalbuterol nebulizers as needed.
- Perform a chest X-ray and consider CPAP trial with repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis.
- Wean off CPAP as tolerated and consider placing an arterial line for closer monitoring and frequent ABG checks if CPAP is required again.

The patient was successfully weaned off CPAP and maintained on a nasal cannula with oxygen saturation levels ranging from 94-95%. The patient still complains of shortness of breath but is more comfortable with lorazepam 0.5mg twice. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction greater than 55%, cardiac index greater than 2.5, no left atrial mass or thrombus seen, no aortic stenosis, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac enzymes were negative with troponin I less than 0.04 and CK-MB at 5. Urine Legionella antigen was negative. The patient has no known drug allergies. He received infusions and other medications as per the ICU protocol. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the symptoms mentioned above. Vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring data are provided, showing stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 150 mL and 340 mL respectively. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, CPAP/PSV mode ventilation, with spontaneous tidal volume and respiratory rate within normal range. ABG results indicate acceptable oxygenation and ventilation. Physical examination findings"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who was admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of his condition. He was initially on CPAP but successfully weaned off and maintained on a nasal cannula with oxygen saturation levels ranging from 94-95%. The patient continues to complain of shortness of breath but is more comfortable with the use of lorazepam (Ativan) 0.5mg twice.

The ECHO report shows an ejection fraction greater than 55%, cardiac index greater than 2.5, no left atrial mass or thrombus seen, no aortic stenosis, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. There is also mild pulmonary artery hypertension and no effusion. The right ventricle is mildly dilated. Cardiac enzymes are negative, and urine legionella antigen is negative as well.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature range of 36.4-35.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/57 to 168/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has atrial fibrillation. Fluid balance shows an input of 670 mL and output of 820 mL, with a negative balance of 150 mL. Respiratory support consists of a nasal cannula and CPAP"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with A-fib, CAD, HTN, and COPD (on intermittent oxygen at
   home) who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening SOB, admitted
   for COPD exacerbation on prednisone burst but now with increasing WOB
   and A. Fib with RVR.
   .
   # Acute respiratory distress: Hemodynamics would suggest pulmonary
   edema but no overt evidence of volume overload by CXR.  History and
   exam more c/w COPD flare given wheezing, limited air movement and chest
   x-ray but no reported change in sputum production or increased cough.
   Patient has limited reserve with FEV1 40% of predicted and in setting
   of pneumonia may decompensate.  PE unlikely given INR.  No e/o
   aspiration by history or CXR.
   - Weaned off CPAP overnight with morphine and lorazepam for agitation
   - Cont prednisone 60mg burst
   - continue levaquin
   - standing levalbuterol nebulizers, tiotropium
   - increase flutic/salmeterol PRN
   - continue vitamin D, calcium
   .
   # Afib: A. Fib with RVR.  Appears to be secondary process in setting of
   acute respiratory distress.  Will undergo trial of cpap and if HR does
   not improve will attempt diltiazem gtt.
   - continue rate control with CCB, dilt gtt prn
   - continue anticoagulation with coumadin
   - unclear if patient needs full dose aspirin and therapeutic warfarin.
   - Cont to hold coumadin dose for supratherapeutic INR (3.9)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pan culture.  Likely [**1-9**] to steroids but in setting of
   decompensation would eval for occult infection.
   - Cx neg to date ([**2-14**])
   .
   # CAD/hypercholesterolemia: No chest pain or other clinical history to
   suggests active ischemia. EKG with no e/o ischemia
   - continue home meds
   - Cardiac enzymes neg x2
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue home meds
   .
   # BPH: continue outpatient medications, foley.
   .
   # FEN - cardiac healthy diet
   # PPx - AC with coumadin, bactrim for PCP prophylaxis, PPI
   # Access - PIV
   # Code - FULL CODE but would not want prolonged life support

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with A-fib, CAD, HTN, and COPD (on intermittent oxygen at
   home) who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening SOB, admitted
   for COPD exacerbation on prednisone burst but now with increasing WOB
   and A. Fib with RVR.
   .
   # Acute respiratory distress: Hemodynamics would suggest pulmonary
   edema but no overt evidence of volume overload by CXR.  History and
   exam more c/w COPD flare given wheezing, limited air movement and chest
   x-ray but no reported change in sputum production or increased cough.
   Patient has limited reserve with FEV1 40% of predicted and in setting
   of pneumonia may decompensate.  PE unlikely given INR.  No e/o
   aspiration by history or CXR. Able to subjectively feel better with
   trial of CPAP and anxiolytic.
   - Weaned off CPAP overnight with morphine and lorazepam for agitation
   - Cont prednisone 60mg, but due to recent rebound after steroid taper,
   will provide another slow taper, instead of burst
   - continue levaquin, short course (5 days total) for low suspicion of
   serious infection
   - standing levalbuterol nebulizers, tiotropium
   - increase flutic/salmeterol PRN
   - continue vitamin D, calcium carbonate
   - Notify Pulm c/s service and Pulmonologist (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 593**]) to make
   aware of patient
s likely worsening of severe COPD
   .
   # Afib: A. Fib with RVR.  Appears to be secondary process in setting of
   acute respiratory distress. Improved with benzo and morphine.
   - Continue rate control with CCB, dilt gtt transitioned to po dilt 60mg
   [**Name (NI) 8372**]
   - Unclear if patient needs full dose aspirin and therapeutic warfarin.
   - Cont to hold coumadin dose for supratherapeutic INR (3.9)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pan culture.  Likely [**1-9**] to steroids but in setting of
   decompensation would eval for occult infection.
   - Bld / U Cx neg to date ([**2-14**])
   .
   # CAD/hypercholesterolemia: No chest pain or other clinical history to
   suggests active ischemia. EKG with no e/o ischemia
   - continue home meds
   - Cardiac enzymes neg x2
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue home meds
   .
   # BPH: continue outpatient medications, foley.
   .
   # FEN - cardiac healthy diet
   # PPx - AC with coumadin, bactrim for PCP prophylaxis, PPI
   # Access - PIV
   # Code - FULL CODE but would not want prolonged life support
   # Dispo - call out to floor this AM

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath and was admitted for COPD exacerbation. The patient has been on intermittent oxygen at home. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 126/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is still experiencing some level of dyspnea but reports feeling more comfortable after receiving ativan 0.5mg twice.

The patient's ECHO results show an ejection fraction greater than 55%, cardiac index greater than 2.5, no left atrial mass or thrombus, no aortic stenosis, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension. Cardiac enzymes are negative with troponin I level less than 0.04 and CK-MB level of 5. Urine Legionella antigen is also negative.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 670 mL and output of 820 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 150 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP mode with a set pressure support of 8 cmH2O, peak inspiratory"
