","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with acute renal failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. He has a history of allergy to Percocet and Tylenol. The patient has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving intravenous fluids and has a fluid balance of +965 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic status, and other physical examination findings are not assessed. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 16.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 5.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 16.0%, platelet count of 161 K/uL, troponin-T level of 0.14 ng/mL, and elevated prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR). The patient's medical conditions include acute renal failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is on ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Progression of acute renal failure: The patient's current condition of acute renal failure may worsen if kidney function does not improve.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue or recur, leading to further blood loss and potential complications.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to acute renal failure and recent blood transfusions increases the risk of developing infections.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PT, PTT, and INR indicate a coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance indicates the possibility of fluid overload, which can contribute to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension, which can be caused by hypovolemia or decreased cardiac output.
7. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels indicate severe anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and inadequate tissue oxygenation."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 274**] is a 86 year old male with history of GIBs, colon CA s/p
   colectomy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and DM who presents with Hct
   of 15, hematemesis and melena in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR
   found to have AVM s/p clipping.
   .
   # GIB: Patient s/p EGD with clipped angioectasia. Hct overnight without
   appropriate bump after 2 units PRBC. Received additional 2 units PRBC.
   Patient remained hemodynamically stable.
   - Recheck post-transfusion hct and coags. Goal hct>21 and INR<1.5
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow-up with GI recs if any.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated from baseline of 1.5 - 2.0.
   FeNa 1. ARF likely secondary to inadequate renal perfusion secondary to
   blood loss.
   - Trend creatinine.
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents, renally dose meds.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Supratherapeutic INR: Patient reports taking his
   medications as directed.  Supratherapeutic INR without concomitant
   antibiotic use or reported change in diet.  Patient is CHADS score 3,
   so would benefit from anticoagulation although history of GIB could be
   prohibitive.
   - Hold Coumadin and reverse INR as above
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Troponin Leak: Likely from ischemic insult in the setting of severe
   anemia, worsened by decreased clearance from acute on chronic renal
   failure. No documented CAD, though patient with DM at this age, likely
   has CAD. Currently without chest pain, SOB and EKG without ischemic
   changes.
   - Cycle enzymes
   - EKG in AM
   - Will not start ASA, BB in the setting of GIB
   .
   # COPD: Normal bicarbonate values in OMR, arguing against being a
   chronic retainer. No active issues.
   - Continue outpatient inhalers
   .
   # Colon CA: Patient was due for surveillance colonoscopy as his last
   was in [**2198**], but he has yet to follow-up.
   - Defer colonoscopy to outpatient setting
   .
   # Iron Deficiency Anemia: Acutely worsened given GI bleeding as above.
   - Continue transfusions as above
   - Follow-up with colonoscopy as outpatient as above
   .
   # Gout
   - Continue Allopurinol, renally dosed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), colon cancer post colectomy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and diabetes mellitus (DM). He presents with a hemoglobin (Hct) level of 15, hematemesis, and melena. The patient has been found to have angioectasia in the fundus of the stomach that was clipped. His INR is supratherapeutic, and he has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is receiving IV pantoprazole (PPI) for prophylaxis against stress ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB and presented with hematemesis and melena. There is a potential for further bleeding due to the presence of angioectasia in the stomach. Close monitoring and continued use of PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis are recommended.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline, indicating possible ARF. This could be secondary to inadequate renal perfusion due to blood loss. Monitoring the creatinine trend and avoiding nephrotoxic agents are advised.

- The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), colon cancer status post colectomy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and diabetes mellitus.
- The patient presented with a hemoglobin level of 15, hematemesis, and melena in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.
- An upper endoscopy (EGD) revealed angioectasia in the fundus, which was clipped.
- The patient received blood transfusions but did not have an appropriate increase in hemoglobin levels, indicating ongoing bleeding.
- The patient remains hemodynamically stable.
- Additional blood transfusions are planned, along with rechecking post-transfusion hemoglobin and coagulation parameters.
- The goal is to achieve a hemoglobin level above 25 and an INR below 1.5.
- Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has been initiated.
- Follow-up with gastroenterology recommendations is advised.
- Diuretic therapy will be delayed due to the patient's rapidly changing renal function.
- Acute renal failure has developed, with creatinine levels elevated from 1.5 to 2.0.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 274**] is a 86 year old male with history of GIBs, colon CA s/p
   colectomy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin and DM who presents with Hct
   of 15, hematemesis and melena in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR
   found to have AVM s/p clipping.
   .
   # GIB: Patient s/p EGD with clipped angioectasia. Hct overnight without
   appropriate bump after 2 units PRBC. Received additional 2 units PRBC
   still with inappropriate increase. Patient remains hemodynamically
   stable without tachycardia or hypotension.
   - Transfuse additional 2 units PRBC. Recheck post-transfusion hct and
   coags. Goal hct>25 and INR<1.5
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow-up with GI recs if any.
   - Hold off on diuresis as long as respiratory status stable given
   rapidly changing renal function.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated from baseline of 1.5 - 2.0.
   FeNa 1. ARF likely secondary to inadequate renal perfusion secondary to
   blood loss.
   - Trend creatinine.
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents, renally dose meds.
   # dCHF: Patient with rales on exam today with O2 requirement.
   Respiratory status otherwise stable. As above, given rapidly changing
   renal function will hold off on diuresis.  Patient currently with
   UOP>60 cc/hr, likely auto-diuresing.
   - If O2 requirement worsens, give lasix IV 10 mg x1.
   - Monitor UOP. Goal >30 cchr
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Supratherapeutic INR: Patient reports taking his
   medications as directed.  Supratherapeutic INR while on amox/clav for
   foot infection.  Patient is CHADS score 3, so would benefit from
   anticoagulation although history of GIB could be prohibitive.
   - Hold coumadin, coag goal as above.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Troponin Leak: Likely from ischemic insult in the setting of severe
   anemia, worsened by decreased clearance from acute on chronic renal
   failure. No documented CAD, though patient with DM at this age, likely
   has CAD. Currently without chest pain, SOB and EKG without ischemic
   changes.
   - Cycle enzymes
   - EKG in AM
   - Hold off on restarting ASA, BB in the setting of GIB
   .
   # COPD: Normal bicarbonate values in OMR, arguing against being a
   chronic retainer. No active issues.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), colon cancer status post colectomy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and diabetes. He presented with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 15, hematemesis, and melena, indicating ongoing bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. The patient was found to have angioectasia in the fundus of the stomach, which was clipped. Despite receiving two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), his Hct did not increase appropriately. He received additional two units of PRBCs and his Hct remains low. The patient's INR is elevated at 1.6, and he was given fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he has rales bilaterally on examination, indicating possible fluid accumulation in the lungs. His renal function is compromised, with elevated creatinine levels from baseline. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes, both of which contribute to renal dysfunction. His current medications include amoxicillin/clavulanate for a foot infection, aspirin, and beta-blockers for atrial fibrillation. He is also taking allopurinol for gout. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating myocardial injury, likely secondary to severe anemia and decreased clearance due to acute-on-chronic renal failure. He has"

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 274**] is an 86-year-old male with a medical history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIBs), colon cancer status post colectomy, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and diabetes. He presents with a hematocrit level of 15, hematemesis, and melena in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR found to have arteriovenous malformation (AVM) post-clipping. The patient received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and lasix 10 IV x 1 between units for crackles. He has allergies to Percocet and Tylenol. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB and is currently experiencing hematemesis and melena. This could lead to further blood loss and a decrease in hematocrit levels, potentially causing hypotension and shock.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's initial creatinine level was elevated but has now returned to baseline. However, the patient remains at risk for acute renal failure due to inadequate renal perfusion secondary to blood loss. Close monitoring of renal function and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents are necessary.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has rales on examination and an increased requirement for supplemental oxygen."
