   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ APML w/ recent ICU admission for hemopytis and respiratory
   distress, s/p extubation, now transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for new hypoxia
   and question of hemopytsis.
    #) Hypoxia:  Patient with worsening respiratory distress following
   observed aspiration during bed-side speech and swallow study.   Patient
   had grossly failed swallow evaluation, and given that had developed
   acute hypoxia following an observed episode of aspiration, respiratory
   worsening may be due to a aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  Patient
   with low grade temperatures and WBC trending up.  She has had some
   difficulty with fluid overload, but chest XR not overwhelming for
   pulmonary edema.  Patient with noted difficulty managing secretions,
   and CXR consistent with atelectasis, possibly for mucous plugging.
   Patient successfully had O2 titrated down from 100% to 50% overnight,
   and is currently comfortably.  ABG showed adwqute
   oxygenation/ventilation.  CXR slightly improved
   --             continue to try to wean O2.  If continues to worsen,
   switch to NRB, and BIPAP in necessary.
   --             given high suspicion of aspiration in this
   immunocompromised patient low reserve, will treat empirically w/
   antibiotics.
                  Continue Levo/flagyl
   --             Repeat CXR in am
   --             Follow am WBC
   --             avoiding diuresis given hypotension
   --             Aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet to try to free
   mucous plug.  If necessary, may need to bronch in order to clear.
   --             Albuterol/atrovent nebs PRN
   #) Hemoptysis:  Patient with prior Icu admission for hemoptysis, but at
   that time had much more pronounced degree of bleeding.  Currently only
   two small amounts of blood observed with suctioning.  HCT slight move
   downward.  Patient shows no evidence of respiratory compromise from
   bleeding.  Given history of friable oral mucosa w/ recent yanquer
   suncitoning, bleeding may be secondary to trauma, although no
   ulceration noted on exam.  As patient has recently been off acyclovir
   to treat HSV, but had completed therapeutic course, may be due to a HSV
   mucositis in OP, airways, or esophogitis.    Patient does not complain
   of pain with swallowing.
   - Continue to follow hct and observe patient.
   # Hypertension:  Patients BP finally gotten under control after
   difficulty time managing refractory BP with clonidine patch,
   nitropaste, IV hydralazine, and switching labatolol to PO coreg.
   Patient no longer able to tolerate Pos.  Patients PB is currently
   100s.  Some conerns of neuron event, making hypotension more concerning
   in this chronically hypertensive patient.
   - will hold all hypertension meds.
   #Swallowing Deficits:  Patient grossly failed bed side swallow
   evaluation w/ marked defects on exam consistent with central deficit.
   Felt to not be consistent with post-intubation deficits.  Patient with
   APML currently undergoing active treatment with history of recent DIC
   and AF has multiple risk factors for thromboempolic as well as
   hemorragic stroke.
   --             maitnain patinet NPO
   --             CT scan for head to evaluate for stroke, may need to get
   MRI once current issues stabilizied and possible neuro c/s.
   --             [**Month (only) 60**] need to consider PEG, continue TPN, and discuss w/
   BMT
   #) Acute systolic heart failure: echo on adm to ICU showed an EF drop
   from 70% to 10%, believed to be [**1-16**] chemo toxicity.  F/u TTE showed
   improved EF of 50%.  Per cards, started on coreg and valsartan.
   - currently NPO given aspiration risk, holding coreg and valsartan
   - continue to diurese, will attempt to diurese off another liter.
   - once can tolerate [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] restart coreg/valsartan per cardiology
   #) APML: S/p induction with 7+3 and Atra, no longer neutropenic [**2-28**].
   - f/u BMT recs, holding on chemo/Atra for now
   - has not been getting PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] as NPO, ok BMT

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for hemoptysis and respiratory distress. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including induction chemotherapy with 7+3 and Atra, extubation, and administration of antibiotics.

The patient's current condition includes worsening respiratory distress following observed aspiration during a bedside speech and swallow study. The patient has low-grade temperatures and a white blood cell count (WBC) that is trending up. The chest X-ray shows signs of atelectasis, possibly due to mucous plugging. The patient is comfortably on supplemental oxygen at 50% and has an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient also has a history of hemoptysis, but currently only small amounts of blood are observed with suctioning. This may be secondary to trauma from recent suctioning or HSV mucositis. There are no signs of respiratory compromise from bleeding.

Additionally, the patient has refractory hypertension that has been managed with various medications, including clonidine patch, nitropaste, IV hydralazine, and labetalol. However, the patient is no longer able to tolerate oral medications, and the blood pressure is currently in the 100s. There are concerns about the possibility of a neurologic event, making hypotension more concerning in this chronically hypertensive patient.

    #) Hypoxia:  Patient with worsening respiratory distress following
   observed aspiration during bed-side speech and swallow study.   Patinet
   had grossly failed swallow evaluation, and given that had developed
   acute hypoxia following an observed episode of aspiration, respiratory
   worsening likely due to a aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  Patient

   #) Hemoptysis:  Patient with prior Icu admission for hemoptysis, but at
   that time had much more pronouced degree of bleeding.  Currently only
   two small amouts of blood observed with suctioning.  HCT stable.
   Patient shows no evidence of respiratory compromise from bleeding.
   Given history of friable oral mucosa w/ recent yanquer suncitoning,
   bleeding may be secondary to trauma, although no ulceration noted on
   exam.  As patinet has recently been off acyclovir to treat HSV, but had
   completed therapeutic course, may be due to a HSV mucositis in OP,
   airways, or esophogitis.    Patient does not complain of pain with
   swallowing.
   - Continue to follow hct and observe patient.
   # Hypertension:  Patients BP finally gotten under control after
   dificulty time maneging refractory BP with clonidine patch, nitropaste,
   IV hydralazine, and switching labatolol to PO coreg.  Patient no longer
   able to tolerate Pos.  Patients PB is currently 100s.
   - hold hydralaizne and nitropase given low blood pressures in setting

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress following observed aspiration during a bed-side speech and swallow study. She had grossly failed swallow evaluation and developed acute hypoxia. The patient is currently on 100% shovel mask and her ABG shows adequate oxygenation and good ventilation. She is also experiencing low-grade fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia/Pneumonitis: The patient's worsening respiratory distress is likely due to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, which is a common complication in immunocompromised patients like those with APML.
2. Thromboembolic and Hemorrhagic Stroke: The patient has multiple risk factors for thromboembolic as well as hemorrhagic stroke. She will need close monitoring, and a CT scan for head evaluation is recommended.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently under control, but there may be concerns regarding rebound hypertension due to holding hydralazine and nitropaste.
4. Swallowing Deficits: The patient grossly failed the bedside swallow evaluation, indicating significant swallowing deficits. Further evaluation and management are necessary.
5. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient had an echo showing an EF drop from 70% to 10%, believed to be due to chemotherapy toxicity. However, the follow-up TTE showed improved EF of "

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo woman with APML, s/p ATRA, course c/b febrile neutropenia,
   hypoxemia, pulmonary edema.
   1. Acute respitory failure: increased O2 requirements with RLL
   atelectasis (from mucus plugging) vs less likely lobar infiltrate.
   Taper down O2 as tolerated. Keep NPO. Keep fluid balance even.
   Hemoptysis is more likely related to suction trauma but can't rule out
   endobronchial lesion.
   2. ID / low grade fever: all cultures negative, low grade fever, no
   longer neutropenic. Agree with short course of levoflox/flagyl covering
   aspiration.
   Would consider atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**].
   Off the empiric caspofungin, vanco, aztreonam. On proph dose of
   acyclovir (for herpetic mucocytis).
   3. HTN: BP overnight went down to 100. All meds including clonidine
   patch on hold. Concern for TIA/CVA could be related to acute decrease
   in BP.
   4. HSV Mucositis: back on proph acyclovir. Limit patient's
   self-suctioning. NPO for now.
   5. APML: Followed by BMT team. Signs of reconstitution.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for increased dyspnea, tachypnea, and desaturation. She was readmitted last night due to these symptoms. The patient had a swallow evaluation and was felt to have aspirated all liquids, medications, etc., with blood coming from the mouth and from suction aspirate. She also had a PT evaluation with a question of weakness from left to right.

The patient received ciprofloxacin, flagyl, Core, and labetalol, with caspofungin, aztreonam, and metronidazole being discontinued. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/52 mmHg to 134/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination showed well-nourished appearance, diaphoresis, lethargy, normal eye and conjunctival examination, no murmurs, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and edema in the extremities. Neurological examination was not assessed due to the patient being attentive and responsive.

Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 8.4 K/uL, hemoglobin"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y/o F w/ APML w/ recent ICU admission for hemopytis and respiratory
   distress, s/p extubation, now transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for new hypoxia
   and question of hemopytsis.
    #) Hypoxia:  Patient with worsening respiratory distress following
   observed aspiration during bed-side speech and swallow study.   Patient
   had grossly failed swallow evaluation, and given that had developed
   acute hypoxia following an observed episode of aspiration, respiratory
   worsening may be due to a aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  Afebrile
   o/n & WBC trending up, inc from 8.9 to 11.8 this am.  Pt getting
   aggressive chest PT for difficulty managing secretions, and CXR
   consistent with atelectasis, likely [**1-16**] mucous plugging.  ABG showed
   adwqute oxygenation/ventilation.
   -- given aspiration. continue empiric Rx with Levo/Flagyl
   -- avoiding diuresis given hypotension
   -- aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet to try to free mucous plug
   -- albuterol/atrovent nebs PRN
   -- f/u am CXR
   #) Hemoptysis:  Patient with prior Icu admission for hemoptysis, but at
   that time had much more pronounced degree of bleeding.  Currently only
   two small amounts of blood observed with suctioning.  HCT slight move
   downward.  Patient shows no evidence of respiratory compromise from
   bleeding.  Given history of friable oral mucosa w/ recent yanquer
   suncitoning, bleeding may be secondary to trauma, although no
   ulceration noted on exam.  As patient has recently been off acyclovir
   to treat HSV, but had completed therapeutic course, may be due to a HSV
   mucositis in OP, airways, or esophogitis.   HCt trended down to 20
   overnight & pt was transfused with 1upRBCs, inc to 26 this am.
   - continue to monitor
   #Swallowing Deficits: failed swallow evaluation w/ marked deficits &
   witnessed aspiration possibly c/w central insult, felt not consistent
   with post-intubation deficits. Non con head CT revealed no acute
   intracran bleed,  noted opacification of R sided mastoid air cells.  Pt
   with recently diagnosed APML who p/w e/o DIC & had intermittent AF,
   ongoing concern for thromboembolic stroke.
   -- maintain strict NPO, on TPN for now
   -- will need MRI once resp issues stabilized & pt able to lie flat
   -- need to consider PEG, continue TPN, and discuss w/ BMT
   # Hypertension: pt with difficult to manage refractory BP on clonidine
   patch, nitropaste, IV hydralazine, and switched from IV labatolol to PO
   coreg. Now s/p failed swallow eval, pt no longer able to tolerate po.
   Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with low sBP concerning for infection in this
   chronically hypertensive patient.   BP came back up overnight, sbps
   ranging from 100-150s
   - will add back BP meds as needed today
   #) Acute systolic heart failure: echo on adm to ICU showed an EF drop
   from 70% to 10%, believed to be [**1-16**] chemo toxicity.  F/u TTE showed
   improved EF of 50%.  Per cards, started on coreg and valsartan.
   - currently NPO given aspiration risk, holding coreg and valsartan
   - continue to diurese, will attempt to diurese off another liter.
   - once can tolerate [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] restart coreg/valsartan per cardiology
   #) APML: S/p induction with 7+3 and Atra, no longer neutropenic [**2-28**].
   - f/u BMT recs, holding on chemo/Atra for now
   - has not been getting PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] as NPO, ok BMT

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who has been admitted to the ICU for hemoptysis and respiratory distress. She was extubated but now presents with new-onset hypoxia and a question of hemoptysis. 

The patient has a history of APML and was recently admitted to the ICU for hemoptysis. She had an episode of aspiration during a bedside speech and swallow study, leading to acute hypoxia. This may be due to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. She is currently receiving aggressive chest physiotherapy (PT) for difficulty managing secretions, and her chest X-ray shows atelectasis, likely due to mucous plugging. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows adequate oxygenation and ventilation. 

The patient is also experiencing hemoptysis, but currently only small amounts of blood are observed with suctioning. This may be secondary to trauma from recent intubation or HSV mucositis. 

The patient failed swallow evaluation with marked deficits and witnessed aspiration, possibly consistent with a central nervous system insult. A non-contrast head CT revealed no acute intracranial bleed, but there was opacification of the right-sided mastoid air cells. The patient has recently diagnosed APML with intermittent atrial fibrillation and concerns for thromboembolic stroke. 

The patient's blood pressure is difficult to manage, and she has been on multiple medications including clonidine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) who was admitted to the ICU for hemoptysis and respiratory distress. She underwent extubation but developed new hypoxia and respiratory distress after observed aspiration during a swallow study. The patient has been aggressive with chest physiotherapy (PT) to clear secretions and improve breathing. She has a history of APML, recent diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), intermittent atrial fibrillation, and ongoing concern for thromboembolic stroke or micro brain metastases. The patient is scheduled for intrathecal chemotherapy later today after an MRI. She also requires a physical therapy consultation, is maintained strict NPO, and continues total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Aspiration Pneumonia/Pneumonitis: The patient developed worsening respiratory distress following observed aspiration during the swallow study. This increases the risk of developing respiratory aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. Aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet are being used to help clear secretions.
2. Neurological Deficits: The patient has marked deficits and witnessed aspiration possibly related to a central process. There is concern for thromboembolic stroke or micro brain metastases. An MRI is planned to further evaluate the cause of the neurological deficits.
3. DIC: The patient has a history of DIC, which is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo woman with APML, s/p ATRA, course c/b febrile neutropenia,
   hypoxemia, pulmonary edema.
   1. Acute respitory failure: sigificantly more stable. Needs ongoing
   chest PT and pulmonary toilet. RLL appears atelectatic. I am not
   anxious to do bronchoscopy but would consider if RLL doesn't expand
   despite aggressive CPT. Taper down O2 as tolerated. Keep NPO.
   Hemoptysis was more likely related to suction trauma.
   2. ID: all cultures negative, afebrile, no longer neutropenic.
   Agree with short course of levoflox/flagyl covering aspiration x [**4-21**] d
   course.
   Would consider atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**]. Off the empiric
   caspofungin, vanco, aztreonam. On proph dose of acyclovir (for herpetic
   mucocytis).
   3. HTN: BP overnight went down to 100. All meds including clonidine
   patch on hold. Concern for TIA/CVA could be related to acute decrease
   in BP. Would aim for SBP of 130-150 for now.
   4. HSV Mucositis: back on proph acyclovir. Limit patient's
   self-suctioning. NPO for now.
   5. APML: Followed by BMT team. Signs of reconstitution.
