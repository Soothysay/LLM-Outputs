   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2195-7-28**].
   The ET tube tip is 4.6 cm above the carina. The cardiomediastinal
   silhouette
   is unchanged. The lung volumes are low, lower than on the prior study
   with
   worsening of bibasilar opacities consistent with worsening of
   atelectasis.
   There is also interval increase in the bilateral pleural effusions that
   still
   may be explained by different position of the patient.
   No new consolidations worrisome for atelectasis, pneumonia or
   aspiration are
   demonstrated.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Rash
   New, fine, confluent, erythematous rash on lower extremities and pelvis
   to waist, as well as on L arm. Likely drug rash v hypersensitivity to
   an environmental exposure, such as sheets.
   - D/c vancomycin, levaquine, and unasyn. Begin penicillin instead.
   - Sarna lotion prn for pruritis.
   # Respiratory Failure
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday. Pt is
   oxygenating well on current ventilation settings. CXR shows increased
   patchy opacities in lower lobes bilaterally, and stable patchy
   opacities in upper lobes. Chemical pneumonitis is likely given the
   rapidity with which the respiratory distress developed, as well as the
   fairly non-focal CXR. Pneumonia, pariticularly with anaerobes, is also
   likely developing though it is not yet clearly evident on the CXR and
   sputum culture showed only mouth flora. Chronic copious secretions in
   upper airways are likely causing Mr. [**Known lastname 3986**] loud rhonchi and
   contributing to his dyspnea.
   - D/c Vancomycin, Unasyn, & Levaquin given no evidence of infection
   with resistant organism. Begin penicillin instead.
   - Decrease FiO2 to 45%, then draw ABG.
   - Continue to follow WBC and temp for signs of developing infection.
   - Sedation w/Fentanyl & Versed.
   - Maintain intubation and frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygeine.
   - Talk to brother about idea of oversewing epiglottis and placing a
   trach in order to prevent aspiration events in the long term.
   # UTI
   Per nursing records, pt with no history of indwelling foley catheter at
   NH. UA here shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   showed no growth.
   - Repeat U/A and urine cx.
   # Hyperkalemia
   -Initial sample hemolyzed, did not prove to be real.
   # Seizure d/o
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.
   - Phenobarbital level within therapeutic range.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
   # Dementia
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now
   - Low dose remeron if agitation develops
   # Osteoarthritis
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear
   uncomfortable now.
   - Hold off on oral pain meds while on sedation w/Fentanyl/Versed.
   - Reasses when patient extubated and off sedation.
   # Decubitus Ulcer
   Stage I decubitus ulcer on exam with no visible skin breakdown.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
   # FEN
   - Restart tube feeds with home Jevity dose.
   - Nutrition consult to get input on tube feeds.
   - Consider possibily revising tube and placing J tube to decrease
   reoccurrence of aspiration v. oversewing glottis and placing trach for
   more definitive solution. Talk to brother and surgery regarding these
   options.
   - No evidence of hypernatremia, no FWF for now
   # Prophylaxis
   -continue home PPI
   -SQ Heparin
   -MOM for bowel regimen

   Assessment and Plan
   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 FEVER
   Spiked a temp to 101.2 this AM. Could represent response to chemical
   pneumonitis or atelectasis v. developing pna.
   - Repeat trial of sputum sample for cx today.
   - F/u AM labs (drawn at 7am).
   - Continue Augmentin.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday. Blood
   gas shows some alcalosis, possibly metabolic compensation for previous
   slight alkalosis. RSPI: 71 (yesterday 60). CXR from yesterday showed
   increased patchy opacities in lower lobes bilaterally, and stable
   patchy opacities in upper lobes; CXR from today is pending. Copious
   secretions are relatively stable.
   Chemical pneumonitis is likely given the rapidity with which the
   respiratory distress developed, as well as the fairly non-focal CXR.
   Pneumonia, pariticularly with anaerobes, is also likely developing
   though it is not yet clearly evident on the CXR and sputum culture
   showed only mouth flora. Chronic copious secretions in upper airways
   are likely causing Mr. [**Known lastname 3986**] loud rhonchi and contributing to his
   dyspnea.
   - Respiratory recommends decrease FiO2 to 40% and PS to 5, then draw
   ABG today.
   - Sedation w/Fentanyl & Versed.
   - Maintain intubation and frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygeine.
   - Two messages left for brother about idea of oversewing epiglottis and
   placing a trach in order to prevent aspiration events in the long term.
   Continue effort to contact him.

   Nutrition:
   - Continue tube feeds with home Jevity dose.
   - Nutrition consult today to get input on tube feeds.
   - Consider possibily revising tube and placing J tube to decrease
   reoccurrence of aspiration v. oversewing glottis and placing trach for
   more definitive solution. Talk to brother and surgery regarding these
   options.

   Disposition:
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, chronic aspiration events, and PEG tube placement since February 27th. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by an aspiration event. The patient has developed fever, respiratory failure, a urinary tract infection, skin breakdown, dementia, osteoarthritis, and a rash. He is currently intubated and sedated with fentanyl and versed. The patient's condition remains unstable, and there are concerns about potential medical complications such as pneumonia, chemical pneumonitis, and further aspiration events.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's chronic copious secretions in the upper airways may contribute to dyspnea and loud rhonchi. Given the rapid development of respiratory distress and the presence of fever, pneumonia is a likely complication.
2. Chemical Pneumonitis: The patient's symptoms of fever and respiratory distress could also be indicative of chemical pneumonitis, especially considering the aspiration event.
3. Developing PN: The sputum culture showed only mouth flora, suggesting the possibility of developing pneumonia, particularly with anaerobes.
4. Aspiration Events: The patient's history of chronic aspiration events and dementia increases the risk of recurrent aspiration, which can lead to further respiratory complications.
5. UTI: The patient's urine analysis shows large white blood cells and moderate leukocytes, indicating a potential urinary tract"

   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday. Blood
   gas shows some alkalosis, possibly metabolic compensation for previous
   slight alkalosis. RSPI: 71 (yesterday 60). CXR from today shows some
   improvement in opacities bilaterally, and no clear infiltrative process
   suggestive of pneumonia. Copious secretions are relatively stable.
   Chemical pneumonitis is thus most likely. PE findings of rhonchi
   suggest significant upper airway inflammation.
   - Change bronchodilators to standing in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Consider inhaled steroid or anticholinergic if he remains very
   rhonchorus.
   - Decrease FiO2 to 40% and PS to 8 (not lower because ET tube is size
   6, thus will provide significant resistance), then draw ABG today.
   - Sedation w/ Fentanyl & Versed.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygeine.
   - Two messages left for brother about idea of oversewing epiglottis and
   placing a trach in order to prevent aspiration events in the long term.
   Try [**Location (un) 223**] area number to contact him, as he may not be at FL home now.
 FEVER
   Spiked a temp to 101.2 this AM. Lung disease seems slightly improved,
   thus may not be the source of the fever. Alternative possibilities
   include pancreatitis, cholecystitis, UTI, or other yet unidentified
   infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, chronic aspiration events, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress following a gross aspiration event. His current vital signs include a temperature of 98.8°F, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 147/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.7 K/uL, slightly elevated hematocrit of 34.1%, and slightly decreased platelet count of 243. Other lab values are within normal limits. Fluid balance shows an intake of 917 mL and output of 1,310 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -393 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, with a tidal volume of 576 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, and an endotracheal tube in place. Breath sounds are bronchial with softer breath sounds on the left side, wheez"

   Assessment and Plan
   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday. Blood
   gas shows some alkalosis, possibly metabolic compensation for previous
   slight alkalosis. RSPI: 71 (yesterday 60). CXR from today shows some
   improvement in opacities bilaterally, and no clear infiltrative process
   suggestive of pneumonia. Copious secretions are relatively stable.
   Chemical pneumonitis is thus most likely. PE findings of rhonchi
   suggest significant upper airway inflammation.
   - Change bronchodilators to standing in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Consider inhaled steroid or anticholinergic if he remains very
   rhonchorus.
   - Decrease FiO2 to 40% and PS to 8 (not lower because ET tube is size
   6, thus will provide significant resistance), then draw ABG today.
   - Sedation w/ Fentanyl & Versed.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygeine.
   - Two messages left for brother about idea of oversewing epiglottis and
   placing a trach in order to prevent aspiration events in the long term.
   Try [**Location (un) 223**] area number to contact him, as he may not be at FL home now.
 FEVER
   Spiked a temp to 101.2 this AM. Lung disease seems slightly improved,
   thus may not be the source of the fever. Alternative possibilities
   include pancreatitis, cholecystitis, UTI, or other yet unidentified
   infection.
   - Check AST, ALT, t-bili, d-bili, alk phos, amylase and lipase for
   possibility of inflammatory abdominal process.
   - F/u sputum cx.
   - F/u AM labs (drawn at 7am).
   - Continue Augmentin.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Per nursing records, pt with no history of indwelling foley catheter at
   NH. UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine
   cx showed no growth.
   - F/u repeat urine cx.
 RASH
   Much better this AM. Likely represented a drug rash.
   - Continue augmentin.
   - Sarna lotion prn for pruritis.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.
   - Phenobarbital level within therapeutic range.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   -          No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear
   uncomfortable now.
   - Hold off on oral pain meds while on sedation w/Fentanyl/Versed.
   - Reasses when patient extubated and off sedation.
   Nutrition:
   - Continue tube feeds with home Jevity dose.
   - Nutrition consult today to get input on tube feeds.
   - Consider possibily revising tube and placing J tube to decrease
   reoccurrence of aspiration v. oversewing glottis and placing trach for
   more definitive solution. Talk to brother and surgery regarding these
   options.
   - No evidence of hypernatremia, no FWF for now
   - Nutrition consult to get input on tube feeds.
   Glycemic Control:  Regular insulin sliding scale, Blood sugar well
   controlled, Comments: Pt was initially hyperglycemic for first 24 hours
   of ICU stay, but sugars have since normalized to low 100s.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and chronic aspiration events who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure following an aspiration event. He is currently sedated with Fentanyl and Versed. The patient's fever has been managed, and there are concerns about a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) despite negative urine culture results. The patient's rash has improved, and he continues to receive Augmentin. His skin breakdown has been assessed, and measures have been taken to prevent further complications. The patient's pain management plan includes holding off on oral pain medications while on sedation and reassessing when the patient is extubated and off sedation. A nutrition consult has been ordered to discuss options for tube feeds and the possibility of revising the tube placement. The patient's glycemic control has been well managed. His lines have been monitored, and he is receiving prophylactic treatments for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. Communication with the patient's brother has been attempted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure developed after a gross aspiration event. Continuous monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further complications such as pneumonia or exacerbation of the current condition.

2. Fever: The patient's fever needs to be closely monitored. It could be indicative of an underlying infection, possibly not related to the respiratory disease. Further investigation is needed to identify the source"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, chronic aspiration events, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube since February 27th. He was transferred from a rehabilitation facility to the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by an aspiration event. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with an FiO2 of 40%. He is sedated but responsive to voice, with a tracheostomy in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a fever of 100.9°F. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal potassium, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Urine culture revealed yeast, but no bacterial growth. Chest X-ray shows improvement from yesterday, with persistent upper lobe haziness bilaterally. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, dementia, seizure disorder, skin breakdown, osteoarthritis, and chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and culture results is necessary.
2. Aspiration events: Given the patient's history of chronic aspiration and recent respiratory distress event, there is a risk of recurrent aspiration leading to further respiratory compromise.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Although the urine culture did not"

   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday. Blood
   gas shows some alkalosis, possibly metabolic compensation for previous
   slight alkalosis. RSPI: 71 (yesterday 60). CXR from today shows some
   improvement in opacities bilaterally, and no clear infiltrative process
   suggestive of pneumonia. Copious secretions are relatively stable.
   Chemical pneumonitis is thus most likely. PE findings of rhonchi
   suggest significant upper airway inflammation.
   - Change bronchodilators to standing in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Consider inhaled steroid or anticholinergic if he remains very
   rhonchorus.
   - Decrease FiO2 to 40% and PS to 8 (not lower because ET tube is size
   6, thus will provide significant resistance), then draw ABG today.
   - Sedation w/ Fentanyl & Versed.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygeine.
   - Two messages left for brother about idea of oversewing epiglottis and
   placing a trach in order to prevent aspiration events in the long term.
   Try [**Location (un) 223**] area number to contact him, as he may not be at FL home now.
 FEVER
   Spiked a temp to 101.2 this AM. Lung disease seems slightly improved,
   thus may not be the source of the fever. Alternative possibilities
   include pancreatitis, cholecystitis, UTI, or other yet unidentified
   infection.
   - Check AST, ALT, t-bili, d-bili, alk phos, amylase and lipase for
   possibility of inflammatory abdominal process.

   - Hold off on oral pain meds while on sedation w/Fentanyl/Versed.
   - Reasses when patient extubated and off sedation.
   Nutrition:
   - Continue tube feeds with home Jevity dose.
   - Nutrition consult today to get input on tube feeds.
   - Consider possibily revising tube and placing J tube to decrease
   reoccurrence of aspiration v. oversewing glottis and placing trach for
   more definitive solution. Talk to brother and surgery regarding these
   options.
   - No evidence of hypernatremia, no FWF for now

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and chronic aspiration events who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure following a gross aspiration event. He has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in his respiratory status, with decreased secretions and improved oxygenation. However, he developed a fever of 101.2°F this morning, which may not be related to his lung disease. Other possible sources of infection include pancreatitis, cholecystitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), or other unidentified infections. The patient also has evidence of urinary tract infection with large white blood cells on urinalysis, but the urine culture was negative. Additionally, he has a rash that is likely due to a drug reaction. The patient's skin breakdown, including stage I sacral ulcer, stage II right heel ulcer, and stage I left ankle ulcer, is being managed with an air mattress and frequent repositioning. He is on phenobarbital for seizure disorder, but his level is within the therapeutic range. The patient's dementia, osteoarthritis, and pain management are also noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure due to a gross aspiration event. Although he has shown some improvement, there is still a risk of further respiratory compromise if secretions continue to obstruct his airways.
2. Fever: The patient's fever could be indicative of an underlying infection, potentially"

   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday. CXR
   from today shows some improvement, and no clear infiltrative process
   suggestive of pneumonia. Copious secretions are improved today. Pt
   tolerating lower vent settings. Chemical pneumonitis is thus most
   likely etiology of respiratory distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to
   the ICU. PE findings of rhonchi suggest significant upper airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Sedation w/ Fentanyl & Versed while on vent.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygeine.
   - Talk to gastroenterology to schedule PEG to j-tube conversion on
   Monday.
   - Communicate with brother again to clarify plan and wishes.
 FEVER
   Spiked a temp to 100.9 this AM, which is lower than past two mornings.
   Cultures have so far been unrevealing. Lung disease seems slightly
   improved, thus may not be the source of the fever. Pancreatitis,
   cholecystitis, and UTI are unlikely given normal lab values and urine
   cx.
   - Continue Augmentin.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   showed no growth.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and chronic aspiration events. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to an aspiration event and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's fever has improved, and his lung disease shows slight improvement. However, he still has poor spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) due to heavy secretions obstructing his upper airways. The patient's brother prefers to keep procedures to a minimum and return the patient to his pre-hospitalization state, unless there are repetitive aspiration events without a procedure. The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, fever, urinary tract infection (UTI), seizure disorder, skin breakdown, dementia, and osteoarthritis. The patient is receiving bronchodilators, sedation with fentanyl and versed while on vent, frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygiene, and will be scheduled for a peg to j-tube conversion on Monday. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be extubated and doing well. The plan is to convert the G tube to a GJ tube by interventional radiology (IR) after the weekend, then return to Hospital1.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to chronic aspiration events. Continued efforts should be made to reduce large airway inflammation and maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Fever: The patient's fever may be unrelated"

   Assessment and Plan
   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday. Blood
   gas shows some alkalosis, possibly metabolic compensation for previous
   slight alkalosis. RSPI: 71 (yesterday 60). CXR from today shows some
   improvement in opacities bilaterally, and no clear infiltrative process
   suggestive of pneumonia. Copious secretions are relatively stable.
   Chemical pneumonitis is thus most likely. PE findings of rhonchi
   suggest significant upper airway inflammation.
   - Change bronchodilators to standing in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Consider inhaled steroid or anticholinergic if he remains very
   rhonchorus.
   - Decrease FiO2 to 40% and PS to 8 (not lower because ET tube is size
   6, thus will provide significant resistance), then draw ABG today.
   - Sedation w/ Fentanyl & Versed.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygeine.
   - Two messages left for brother about idea of oversewing epiglottis and
   placing a trach in order to prevent aspiration events in the long term.
   Try [**Location (un) 223**] area number to contact him, as he may not be at FL home now.
 FEVER
   Spiked a temp to 101.2 this AM. Lung disease seems slightly improved,
   thus may not be the source of the fever. Alternative possibilities
   include pancreatitis, cholecystitis, UTI, or other yet unidentified
   infection.
   - Check AST, ALT, t-bili, d-bili, alk phos, amylase and lipase for
   possibility of inflammatory abdominal process.
   - F/u sputum cx.
   - F/u AM labs (drawn at 7am).
   - Continue Augmentin.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Per nursing records, pt with no history of indwelling foley catheter at
   NH. UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine
   cx showed no growth.
   - F/u repeat urine cx.
 RASH
   Much better this AM. Likely represented a drug rash.
   - Continue augmentin.
   - Sarna lotion prn for pruritis.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.
   - Phenobarbital level within therapeutic range.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   -          No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear
   uncomfortable now.
   - Hold off on oral pain meds while on sedation w/Fentanyl/Versed.
   - Reasses when patient extubated and off sedation.
   Nutrition:
   - Continue tube feeds with home Jevity dose.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and chronic aspiration events. He was transferred to the ICU from a rehabilitation facility in respiratory distress due to an aspiration event. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, fever, urinary tract infection (UTI), rash, seizure, skin breakdown, dementia, osteoarthritis, and malnutrition.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient developed respiratory failure following a gross aspiration event. His blood gas shows some alkalosis, possibly metabolic compensation for previous slight alkalosis. The CXR shows improvement in opacities bilaterally, with no clear infiltrative process suggestive of pneumonia. Chemical pneumonitis is the most likely cause, with significant upper airway inflammation indicated by PE findings of rhonchi. The plan includes changing bronchodilators to standing, considering inhaled steroid or anticholinergic if he remains very rhonchorus, decreasing FiO2 to 40% and PS to 8, drawing ABG today, sedation with Fentanyl & Versed, frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygiene, and discussing the possibility of oversewing epiglottis and placing a tracheostomy for long-term prevention of aspiration events.

2. Fever: The patient spiked a temperature to 101.2 degrees this morning. Lung disease seems slightly improved, so it may not be the source of the fever. Alternative possibilities include pancreatitis"

   Assessment and Plan
   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday. CXR
   from today shows some improvement, and no clear infiltrative process
   suggestive of pneumonia. Copious secretions are improved today. Pt
   tolerating lower vent settings. Chemical pneumonitis is thus most
   likely etiology of respiratory distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to
   the ICU. PE findings of rhonchi suggest significant upper airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Sedation w/ Fentanyl & Versed while on vent.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygeine.
   - Talk to gastroenterology to schedule PEG to j-tube conversion on
   Monday.
   - Communicate with brother again to clarify plan and wishes.
 FEVER
   Spiked a temp to 100.9 this AM, which is lower than past two mornings.
   Cultures have so far been unrevealing. Lung disease seems slightly
   improved, thus may not be the source of the fever. Pancreatitis,
   cholecystitis, and UTI are unlikely given normal lab values and urine
   cx.
   - Continue Augmentin.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   showed no growth.
   - Urine cx x 2 have been unreavealing.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.
   - Phenobarbital level within therapeutic range.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and chronic aspiration events with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He was transferred from a rehabilitation facility to the ICU in respiratory distress due to an aspiration event. The patient has been on invasive ventilation, but it was stopped on 07/31/2195 at 02:30 PM. He is currently on noninvasive ventilation with an aerosol-cool face tent and 50% FiO2. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/44 mmHg to 153/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.7 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The patient's electrolytes are relatively stable, with sodium at 139 mg/dL, potassium at 3.8 mEq/L, and chloride at 107 mEq/L. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, PaO2 of 74 mmHg, and HCO3- of 26 mEq/L.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure secondary to a gross aspiration event, which occurred on Sunday. A chest X-ray from today shows some improvement and no clear infiltrative process suggestive of pneumonia. The patient is tolerating lower vent settings, and copious secretions have improved today. Chemical pneumonitis is the most likely etiology of the respiratory distress that brought the patient to the ICU. The patient is on bronchodilators to reduce large airway inflammation and frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygiene. The plan is to convert the patient's percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) to a feeding jejunostomy (J-tube) on Monday.

The patient also has a fever, which has been present for the past few days. Cultures have been unrevealing so far, and the lung disease seems slightly improved, making it less likely that the fever is due to the lung infection. Other potential sources of the fever, such as pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and urinary tract infection (UTI), are unlikely given normal lab values and urine culture results. The patient is continuing on Augmentin.

The patient's urine analysis shows large white blood cells and moderate leukocytes, which are concerning for a UTI, but the urine culture has shown no growth. The patient's seizure disorder is being managed with phenobarbital, and the level is within the therapeutic range. The patient's skin breakdown includes"

He is also experiencing fever, urinary tract infection (UTI), seizure without status epilepticus, skin breakdown (pressure ulcers), dementia, and osteoarthritis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's chronic aspiration events increase the risk of pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures should be done to detect any signs of infection.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered if necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and advanced age are risk factors for DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and consideration of prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin may be necessary.
4. UTI: Despite negative urine cultures, the patient's urinary tract symptoms suggest a possible UTI. Repeated urinalysis and urine culture should be done to confirm the diagnosis and initiate appropriate treatment if needed.
5. Seizure recurrence: Although"

   respiratory failure.  What remains is concern for improvement
   clinically and will need decision on antibiotic course.
 LEUKOCYTOSIS and concern of pneumonia as source.  He has relatively
   minimal infiltrate in lower lobes bilaterally.  More convincing may be
   urinary tract infection at admission.  Wound culture in the setting of
   clean appearing site is less convincing for infection.
   -On Augmentin and complete 7 day course of antibiotics for pneumonia
   and UTI
   -Await final culture results from sputum
 RASH--When on Levo/Vanco/ZOsyn so antibiotics modified.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male admitted with respiratory failure and successfully extubated. The patient has shown clinical improvement in regards to respiratory failure but still requires decision on antibiotic course.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including leukocytosis, concern of pneumonia as the source, minimal infiltrate in lower lobes bilaterally, urinary tract infection at admission, wound culture suggesting Pseudomonas from wound culture only, and decubitus ulcer (present at admission).

The patient is currently on Augmentin and a complete 7-day course of antibiotics for pneumonia and UTI, awaiting final culture results from sputum. The patient's antibiotics were modified due to a rash when on Levo/Vanco/ZOsyn.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, wound infection, and decubitus ulcer. These conditions require careful monitoring and appropriate management to prevent further complications and ensure the patient's well-being."

   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday. CXR
   from today shows some improvement, suggesting pneumonitis. Copious
   secretions are improved today. Chemical pneumonitis is thus most likely
   etiology of respiratory distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU.
   PE findings of rhonchi suggest significant upper airway inflammation.
   Pt having a lot of secretions today.
   - Continue bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygeine.
   - Talk to gastroenterology to schedule PEG to j-tube conversion on
   Monday.
   - Communicate with brother again to clarify plan and wishes.
 FEVER
   Afebrile but bump in white count. Cultures have so far been
   unrevealing. Lung disease seems slightly improved, thus may not be the
   source of the fever. Pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and UTI are unlikely
   given normal lab values and urine cx.
   -continue augmenten  for 7 days for UTI/Pneumonitis
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   showed no growth.
   - Urine cx x 2 have been unreavealing.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.
   - Phenobarbital level within therapeutic range.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)

He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress following a gross aspiration event. The patient has been on invasive ventilation, and his condition has improved with decreased secretions. The assessment indicates respiratory failure, fever, urinary tract infection (UTI), seizure without status epilepticus, skin breakdown, dementia, and osteoarthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and subsequent need for invasive ventilation indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. This could be due to the aspiration event leading to chemical pneumonitis.
2. Fever: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an underlying infection. The source of the fever is currently unknown, but further investigation is needed to identify the cause.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The presence of leukocytes in the urine and the possibility of a UTI should be considered, despite negative urine cultures. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic treatment may be necessary.
4. Seizure: The patient experienced an episode of seizure activity, which may be related to his known seizure disorder or the recent respiratory distress.
5. Skin Breakdown: The patient has stage I sacral, stage II right heel, and stage I left ankle ulcers, indicating potential skin breakdown. Proper wound care,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonitis. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been experiencing low urine output, requiring multiple boluses of normal saline. There was also a brief episode of irregular rhythm that resolved spontaneously. The patient's fentanyl was discontinued and replaced with ultram for sleep. A discussion took place regarding the conversion of the patient's G-tube to a J-tube, which may happen on Monday.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 105/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 90.1 kg at admission to 85.4 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,159 mL and total output of 1,075 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 759 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an aerosol-cool face tent, and their SpO2 is maintained at 97%. The most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate pH of 7.26, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 26 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 26 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished and not in acute distress. The patient"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday.
   Chemical pneumonitis is thus most likely etiology of respiratory
   distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU. Today, breathing is
   labored and pt has a lot of secretions in upper airways that he is not
   able to clear because he doesn
t have an effective cough. Desaturates
   to low 90% when laboring to clear secretions. Nurse has not been able
   to drop a nasotracheal tube to manage secretions. CXR from today shows
   slight increased haziness of L upper lobes. WBC count down, pt is
   afebrile.
   - Continue bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygeine.
   - PEG to j-tube conversion on Monday.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Down to 31.7 from 33.5 yesterday, 38.4 on [**7-31**], and 32.1 on [**7-30**]. Pt was
   up 2L yesterday. No clear source of bleeding. MCV normal and no clear
   reason to believe there
s decreased production.
   -          Re-check today at 3pm.
   -          Consider stool guaiac.
   -          Consider hemolysis labs (haptoglobin, LDH).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-inch tall, 85.4 kg male who is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88/48 mmHg to 132/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium, famotidine, and other ICU medications. The patient has a history of leukocytosis, rash, respiratory failure, seizure, decubitus ulcer, dementia, osteoarthritis, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, but their blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating potential cardiovascular compromise. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, resulting in respiratory failure.
2. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizure without status epilepticus. This increases the risk of recurrent seizures or postictal state, which can affect the patient's neurological status.
3. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer. Improper positioning or inadequate pressure relief can worsen the ulcer and lead to infection or deeper tissue damage.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of UT"

   Assessment and Plan
   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday.
   Chemical pneumonitis was the most likely etiology of the respiratory
   distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU. Today, breathing is
   labored and pt has a lot of secretions in upper airways that he is not
   able to clear because he doesn
t have an effective cough. Desaturates
   to low 90% when laboring to clear secretions. Nurse has not been able
   to drop a nasotracheal tube to manage secretions. CXR from today shows
   slight increased haziness of upper lobes. However WBC count down, pt is
   afebrile.
   - Continue bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygiene.
   - Keep i/o
s even today to avoid developing pulmonary edema.
   - PEG to j-tube conversion on Monday.
   - Consider scopolamine patch or nortriptylline to decrease secretions
   if PEC to j-tube conversion doesn
t help sufficiently.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Down to 31.7 from 33.5 yesterday, 38.4 on [**7-31**], and 32.1 on [**7-30**]. Pt was
   up 2L yesterday. No clear source of bleeding. MCV normal and no clear
   reason to believe there
s decreased production.
   -          Re-check today at 3pm.
   -          Consider stool guaiac.
   -          Consider hemolysis labs (haptoglobin, LDH).
 FEVER
   Afebrile and white count down from 11.6 to 9.4 today. Cultures have
   shown only oropharyngeal secretions.
   -Continue augmenten  for total of 7 days for UTI/Pneumonitis
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pt is afebrile.
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   x 2 showed no growth.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.
   - Phenobarbital level within therapeutic range.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear
   uncomfortable now.
   - Hold off on oral pain meds while on sedation w/Fentanyl/Versed.
   - Reassess when patient extubated and off sedation.

   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 4112**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2195-8-2**] 12:20 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, chronic aspiration events, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube since February 27th. He was transferred from a rehab facility due to respiratory distress caused by an aspiration event.

The patient has been in the ICU and has experienced several medical complications. These include respiratory failure due to chemical pneumonitis resulting from the aspiration event, decreased hematocrit levels without a clear source of bleeding, fever with white blood cell count down, urinary tract infection (UTI) with no growth on urine cultures, seizure activity, skin breakdown with stage I sacral ulcer, stage II right heel ulcer, and stage I left ankle ulcer. Additionally, the patient has dementia, osteoarthritis, and is on mechanical ventilation support.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure, development of pneumonia, further skin breakdown and pressure ulcers, worsening UTI, and seizures. It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, manage secretions effectively, provide adequate nutrition, maintain glycemic control, and prevent further complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of the current medical complications while also addressing the underlying causes to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday. CXR
   from today shows some improvement, suggesting pneumonitis. Copious
   secretions are improved today. Chemical pneumonitis is thus most likely
   etiology of respiratory distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU.
   PE findings of rhonchi suggest significant upper airway inflammation.
   Pt having a lot of secretions today.
   - Continue bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygeine.
   - Talk to gastroenterology to schedule PEG to j-tube conversion on
   Monday.
   - Communicate with brother again to clarify plan and wishes.
 FEVER
   Afebrile but bump in white count. Cultures have so far been
   unrevealing. Lung disease seems slightly improved, thus may not be the
   source of the fever. Pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and UTI are unlikely
   given normal lab values and urine cx.
   -continue augmenten  for 7 days for UTI/Pneumonitis
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   showed no growth.
   - Urine cx x 2 have been unreavealing.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.
   - Phenobarbital level within therapeutic range.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear

   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, chronic aspiration events, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) since February 27th. He was transferred from a rehabilitation facility to the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by an aspiration event. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, fever, urinary tract infection (UTI), seizure, skin breakdown, and dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and failure to improve despite interventions suggest a potential complication related to the underlying lung condition or infection.
2. Seizure: Although the patient's seizure was controlled with phenobarbital, there is still a risk of further seizures due to the underlying seizure disorder.
3. UTI: Despite negative urine cultures, the patient's symptoms and urinalysis findings suggest a possible UTI, which could complicate his overall condition if left untreated.
4. Skin Breakdown: The presence of stage I and II pressure ulcers indicates a risk for further skin breakdown and potential infection.
5. Dementia: The patient's advanced dementia may complicate his recovery and ability to follow medical instructions.
6. Osteoarthritis: The patient's osteoarthritis may contribute to discomfort and mobility issues during rehabilitation.
7. Medication Interactions: The patient's multiple medications and recent changes in treatment may increase the risk of drug interactions and adverse effects.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted with a significant aspiration event. He has continued secretion volume requiring close nursing care and a largely ineffective cough. There is a suggestion of increased infiltrate in the left upper lobe (LUL) and superior margin of the left hilum on imaging. The patient is being treated for aspiration pneumonia, obstructive pulmonary disease, leukocytosis, rash, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), seizure, decubitus ulcer, dementia, osteoarthritis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and aspiration pneumonia. In the ICU, the patient is receiving ProBalance nutrition and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. He is also on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure and ongoing respiratory issues, including ineffective cough and crackles in the lungs. This increases the risk of further respiratory compromise and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening lung infection and respiratory symptoms if not effectively managed.
3. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer, which could worsen due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
4. UTI: The patient's history of dementia"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday.
   Chemical pneumonitis was the most likely etiology of the respiratory
   distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU. Today, breathing is
   labored and pt has a lot of secretions in upper airways that he is not
   able to clear because he doesn
t have an effective cough. Desaturates
   to low 90% when laboring to clear secretions. Nurse has not been able
   to drop a nasotracheal tube to manage secretions. CXR from today shows
   _____. However WBC count down, pt is afebrile.
   - Continue bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue steroid taper.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygiene.
   - Keep i/o
s even today to avoid developing pulmonary edema; use lasix
   as needed (60 PO required yesterday).
   - PEG to j-tube conversion on Monday.
   - Consider scopolamine patch or nortriptylline to decrease secretions
   if PEC to j-tube conversion doesn
t help sufficiently.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Increased from 31.7 to 32.3 to 36 yesterday. [**Month (only) 60**] have been dilutional,
   as pt was up 2L day before yesterday when crit dropped. No clear source
   of bleeding. MCV normal and no clear reason to believe there
   decreased production.
   -          Continue to follow on AM labs.
 FEVER
   Afebrile and white count down from 11.6 to 9.4 today. Cultures have
   shown only oropharyngeal secretions.
   -Continue augmenten  for total of 7 days for UTI/Pneumonitis
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pt is afebrile.
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   x 2 showed no growth.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.
   - Phenobarbital level within therapeutic range.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear
   uncomfortable now.
   - Hold off on oral pain meds while on sedation w/Fentanyl/Versed.
   - Reassess when patient extubated and off sedation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, chronic aspiration events, and PEG tube placement. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure following a gross aspiration event. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is experiencing labored breathing with an accumulation of secretions in the upper airways. Despite efforts to clear the secretions, the patient desaturates to low 90% and has not been able to tolerate a nasotracheal tube. The most recent chest X-ray shows ___. The patient's WBC count has decreased, and he is afebrile.

The plan of care includes continuing bronchodilators to reduce large airway inflammation, continuing steroid taper, frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygiene, and monitoring I/O to avoid pulmonary edema. Lasix will be used as needed to manage fluid balance. A PEG to j-tube conversion is scheduled for Monday, and consideration will be given to using a scopolamine patch or nortriptyline to decrease secretions if the conversion does not sufficiently improve the patient's condition.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, with labored breathing and inadequate clearance of secretions. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential need for increased ventilatory support.

2. Decreased Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit has increased from 31.7 to 32"

   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday.
   Chemical pneumonitis was the most likely etiology of the respiratory
   distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU. Today, breathing is
   labored and pt has a lot of secretions in upper airways that he is not
   able to clear because he doesn
t have an effective cough. Desaturates
   to low 90% when laboring to clear secretions. Nurse has not been able
   to drop a nasotracheal tube to manage secretions. CXR from today is
   stable. WBC count down, pt is afebrile.
   - Sputum culture from [**7-28**] showed pseudomonas. Continue ceftazidime for
   total of 2 week course.
   - Continue frequent bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue scopolamine patch in hopes of decreasing oropharyngeal
   secretions.
   - Mine chart for evidence of COPD, reassess physical exam for wheezes,
   and continue steroid taper only if pt thought to benefit.
   - Continue frequent suctioning and chest PT for pulmonary hygiene.
   - Keep i/o
s even today to avoid developing pulmonary edema; use lasix
   as needed (60 PO required yesterday).
   - PEG to j-tube conversion today.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Increased from 31.7 to 32.3 to 36 yesterday. [**Month (only) 60**] have been dilutional,
   as pt was up 2L day before yesterday when crit dropped. No clear source
   of bleeding. MCV normal and no clear reason to believe there
   decreased production.
   -          Continue to follow on AM labs.
 FEVER
   Pt now afebrile and white count down. Cultures from [**7-28**] showed
   pseudomonas.
   -Continue augmenten  for total of 7 days for UTI/Pneumonitis

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and chronic aspiration events who was admitted to the ICU in respiratory distress due to aspiration. The patient's respiratory status has been labored with excessive secretions, leading to desaturation. He has been on frequent bronchodilators and steroids, and a sputum culture showed pseudomonas infection. The patient's hematocrit levels have increased, and he has been on IV fluids. He is afebrile and white blood cell count is down. The patient also has stage I sacral ulcer, stage II right heel ulcer, and stage I left ankle ulcer, for which he is on an air mattress and frequent repositioning. The patient is on phenobarbital for seizure control and has advanced dementia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and labored breathing may lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Pseudomonas infection: The presence of pseudomonas in the sputum culture indicates a potential bacterial infection, which could worsen the respiratory status if not properly managed.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's increased hematocrit levels and fluid balance may increase the risk of developing pulmonary edema.
4. Skin breakdown: The stage I sacral ulcer, stage II right heel ulcer, and stage I left ankle ulcer indicate ongoing pressure ulcers, which can worsen if not managed appropriately.
5. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure disorder and the use of phenobarbital require close monitoring for any seizure activity.
6. UTI/Pneumonitis: The patient's urinary tract infection (UTI) and pneumonia need to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
7. Dementia: The patient's advanced dementia requires ongoing assessment and management of his cognitive function and behavioral changes.
8. Osteoarthritis: The patient's osteoarthritis pain should be reassessed when he is extubated and off sedation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, manage the pseudomonas infection, prevent and manage pressure ulcers, monitor for seizure activity, manage UTI/pneumonitis, assess and manage dementia, and address the osteoarthritis pain when appropriate."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, chronic aspiration events, and PEG tube placement. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by an aspiration event. The patient has been experiencing labored breathing, excessive secretions, and desaturation to low 90% when clearing secretions. The chest X-ray shows increased haziness in the upper lobes. The patient's WBC count has decreased, indicating improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and labored breathing indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The increased haziness in the upper lobes on chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Cultures should be obtained to confirm the presence of an infection.
3. Decreased Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit levels have decreased from 33.5 to 31.7. Further investigation is required to identify the cause of this drop, including re-checking at 3 pm, considering stool guaiac, and evaluating for hemolysis labs.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday.
   Chemical pneumonitis was the most likely etiology of the respiratory
   distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU. Today, breathing is
   labored and pt has a lot of secretions in upper airways that he is not
   able to clear because he doesn
t have an effective cough. Desaturates
   to low 90% when laboring to clear secretions. Nurse has not been able
   to drop a nasotracheal tube to manage secretions. CXR from today shows
   _____. However WBC count down, pt is afebrile.
   - Continue bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue steroid taper.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygiene.
   - Keep i/o
s even today to avoid developing pulmonary edema; use lasix
   as needed (60 PO required yesterday).
   - PEG to j-tube conversion on Monday.
   - Consider scopolamine patch or nortriptylline to decrease secretions
   if PEC to j-tube conversion doesn
t help sufficiently.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Increased from 31.7 to 32.3 to 36 yesterday. [**Month (only) 60**] have been dilutional,
   as pt was up 2L day before yesterday when crit dropped. No clear source
   of bleeding. MCV normal and no clear reason to believe there
   decreased production.
   -          Continue to follow on AM labs.
 FEVER
   Afebrile and white count down from 11.6 to 9.4 today. Cultures have
   shown only oropharyngeal secretions.
   -Continue augmenten  for total of 7 days for UTI/Pneumonitis
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pt is afebrile.
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   x 2 showed no growth.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.
   - Phenobarbital level within therapeutic range.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear
   uncomfortable now.
   - Hold off on oral pain meds while on sedation w/Fentanyl/Versed.
   - Reassess when patient extubated and off sedation.

","The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, chronic aspiration events, and PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) tube placement. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure following a gross aspiration event. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/57 mmHg to 143/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

The patient's respiratory status has been improving, with decreased wheezing and decreased use of accessory muscles. However, he still requires supplemental oxygen through an aerosol-cool face tent. His ABG (arterial blood gas) results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2 of 150 on 70% FiO2, and HCO3- of 27 mEq/L. 

The patient's WBC (white blood cell) count has decreased from 11.6 to 9.4 today, indicating a possible improvement in infection. His hematocrit has increased from 31.7 to 36.0, possibly due to fluid administration. 

The patient's urine output has been poor, requiring additional lasix to promote diuresis.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday.
   Chemical pneumonitis was the most likely etiology of the respiratory
   distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU. Today, breathing is
   labored and pt has a lot of secretions in upper airways that he is not
   able to clear because he doesn
t have an effective cough. Desaturates
   to low 90% when laboring to clear secretions. Nurse has not been able
   to drop a nasotracheal tube to manage secretions. CXR from today shows
   _____. However WBC count down, pt is afebrile.
   - Continue bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue steroid taper.
   - Continue frequent suctioning for pulmonary hygiene.
   - Keep i/o
s even today to avoid developing pulmonary edema; use lasix
   as needed (60 PO required yesterday).
   - PEG to j-tube conversion on Monday.
   - Consider scopolamine patch or nortriptylline to decrease secretions
   if PEC to j-tube conversion doesn
t help sufficiently.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Increased from 31.7 to 32.3 to 36 yesterday. [**Month (only) 60**] have been dilutional,
   as pt was up 2L day before yesterday when crit dropped. No clear source
   of bleeding. MCV normal and no clear reason to believe there
   decreased production.
   -          Continue to follow on AM labs.
 FEVER
   Afebrile and white count down from 11.6 to 9.4 today. Cultures have
   shown only oropharyngeal secretions.
   -Continue augmenten  for total of 7 days for UTI/Pneumonitis
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pt is afebrile.
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   x 2 showed no growth.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.
   - Phenobarbital level within therapeutic range.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear
   uncomfortable now.
   - Hold off on oral pain meds while on sedation w/Fentanyl/Versed.
   - Reassess when patient extubated and off sedation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, chronic aspiration events, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure following an aspiration event. The patient's current conditions include respiratory distress, fever, decreased hematocrit, urinary tract infection (UTI), seizure, skin breakdown, dementia, and osteoarthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and aspiration event indicate a high risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. UTI: Although the patient's fever has resolved, and cultures have shown no growth, there is still a possibility of a urinary tract infection (UTI) due to the presence of large white blood cells (WBCs) and leukocytes in the urine analysis.
3. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and while he is currently on phenobarbital, there is still a risk of recurrent seizures.
4. Skin Breakdown: The patient has stage I sacral, stage II right heel, and stage I left ankle ulcers, which increases the risk of further skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
5. Dementia: The patient's advanced dementia may lead to behavioral disturbances, difficulty with communication, and increased risk of falls or accidents.
6. Osteoarthritis: The patient's oste"

   - Mine chart for evidence of COPD, reassess physical exam for wheezes,
   and continue steroid taper only if pt thought to benefit.
   - Continue frequent suctioning and chest PT for pulmonary hygiene.
   - Keep i/o

   as needed (60 PO required yesterday).
   - PEG to j-tube conversion today.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Increased from 31.7 to 32.3 to 36 yesterday. [**Month (only) 60**] have been dilutional,
   as pt was up 2L day before yesterday when crit dropped. No clear source
   of bleeding. MCV normal and no clear reason to believe there
   decreased production.
   -          Continue to follow on AM labs.
 FEVER
   Pt now afebrile and white count down. Cultures from [**7-28**] showed
   pseudomonas.
   -Continue augmenten  for total of 7 days for UTI/Pneumonitis
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pt is afebrile.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and chronic aspiration events who was admitted to the ICU in respiratory distress after an aspiration event. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. The patient has a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving bronchodilators, scopolamine patch, and antibiotics (ceftazidime) for his conditions. His hematocrit levels have increased, and he is at risk for developing pulmonary edema. The patient also has skin breakdown, dementia, osteoarthritis, and a history of seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection: The patient's sputum culture showed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This bacterium is known to cause respiratory infections, especially in individuals with compromised lung function or those who are immunocompromised.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Frequent suctioning and chest physiotherapy are being performed to minimize this risk.

3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's increased hematocrit levels and fluid balance indicate a risk for developing pulmonary edema. Lasix has been given to prevent this complication.

4. Skin breakdown: The patient has stage I sacral, stage II right heel, and stage I left ankle ul"

   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in this patient with an S-shaped
   thoracolumbar scoliosis. Patchy opacities in the upper
   zones bilaterally most likely reflects summation shadows rather than
   focal
   regions of pneumonia. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits and
   there
   is no evidence of pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday.
   Chemical pneumonitis was the most likely etiology of the respiratory
   distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU. Today, breathing is
   labored and pt has a lot of secretions in upper airways that he is not
   able to clear because he doesn
t have an effective cough. Desaturates
   to low 90% when laboring to clear secretions, however nurses have been
   able to manage secretions with suctioning every few hours. CXR from
   today is stable. WBC count down, pt is afebrile.
   - Sputum culture from [**7-28**] showed pseudomonas. Continue ceftazidime for
   total of 2 week course, via new midline that was placed this morning.
   - Continue frequent bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue scopolamine patch in hopes of decreasing oropharyngeal
   secretions.
   - Continue to hold steroids, as pt has no hx of COPD and exam is stable
   without them.
   - Continue frequent suctioning and chest PT for pulmonary hygiene.
   - Keep i/o
s even today to avoid developing pulmonary edema; use lasix
   as needed.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Increased to 36 then 34.8 this AM. No clear source of bleeding (Guaiac
   negative). MCV normal and no clear reason to believe there
s decreased
   production. Thus previous drop in hct have been dilutional.
   - Continue to follow on AM labs.
 FEVER
   Pt now afebrile and white count down. Cultures from [**7-28**] showed
   pseudomonas.
   -Continue ceftazidime for total of 14d course.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pt is afebrile.
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   x 2 showed no growth.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.  Phenobarbitol level therapeutic.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday.
   Chemical pneumonitis was the most likely etiology of the respiratory
   distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU. Today, breathing is
   labored and pt has a lot of secretions in upper airways that he is not
   able to clear because he doesn
t have an effective cough. Desaturates
   to low 90% when laboring to clear secretions. Nurse has not been able
   to drop a nasotracheal tube to manage secretions. CXR from today is
   stable. WBC count down, pt is afebrile.
   - Sputum culture from [**7-28**] showed pseudomonas. Continue ceftazidime for
   total of 2 week course.
   - Continue frequent bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue scopolamine patch in hopes of decreasing oropharyngeal
   secretions.
   - Mine chart for evidence of COPD, reassess physical exam for wheezes,
   and continue steroid taper only if pt thought to benefit.
   - Continue frequent suctioning and chest PT for pulmonary hygiene.
   - Keep i/o
s even today to avoid developing pulmonary edema; use lasix
   as needed (60 PO required yesterday).
   - PEG to j-tube conversion today.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Increased from 31.7 to 32.3 to 36 yesterday. [**Month (only) 60**] have been dilutional,
   as pt was up 2L day before yesterday when crit dropped. No clear source
   of bleeding. MCV normal and no clear reason to believe there
   decreased production.
   -          Continue to follow on AM labs.
 FEVER
   Pt now afebrile and white count down. Cultures from [**7-28**] showed
   pseudomonas.
   -Continue augmenten  for total of 7 days for UTI/Pneumonitis
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pt is afebrile.
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   x 2 showed no growth.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.
   - Recheck phenobarbitol level.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear
   uncomfortable now.
   - Hold off on oral pain meds while on sedation w/Fentanyl/Versed.
   - Reassess when patient extubated and off sedation.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, chronic aspiration events, and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by an aspiration event.

2. The patient has been receiving treatment for respiratory failure, including antibiotics (ceftazidime) for a pseudomonas infection, bronchodilators to reduce airway inflammation, scopolamine patch to decrease oropharyngeal secretions, and frequent suctioning and chest physiotherapy for pulmonary hygiene.

3. The patient's hematocrit levels have increased from 31.7 to 36, which may be due to dilutional effects from increased fluid intake. There is no clear source of bleeding, and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is normal.

4. The patient was previously febrile but is now afebrile, and the white blood cell count is decreasing. Cultures from July 28th showed pseudomonas.

5. There are no current signs of a urinary tract infection (UTI), despite initial concerns indicated by urine analysis.

6. The patient experienced a seizure episode but has not had any further reported seizure-like activity. He is currently on phenobarbital, and his level should be rechecked.

7. The patient has existing"

   Assessment and Plan
   82yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday.
   Chemical pneumonitis was the most likely etiology of the respiratory
   distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU. Today, breathing is
   labored and pt has a lot of secretions in upper airways that he is not
   able to clear because he doesn
t have an effective cough. Desaturates
   to low 90% when laboring to clear secretions, however nurses have been
   able to manage secretions with suctioning every few hours. CXR from
   today is stable. WBC count down, pt is afebrile.
   - Sputum culture from [**7-28**] showed pseudomonas. Continue ceftazidime for
   total of 2 week course, via new midline that was placed this morning.
   - Continue frequent bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue scopolamine patch in hopes of decreasing oropharyngeal
   secretions.
   - Continue to hold steroids, as pt has no hx of COPD and exam is stable
   without them.
   - Continue frequent suctioning and chest PT for pulmonary hygiene.
   - Keep i/o
s even today to avoid developing pulmonary edema; use lasix
   as needed.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Increased to 36 then 34.8 this AM. No clear source of bleeding (Guaiac
   negative). MCV normal and no clear reason to believe there
s decreased
   production. Thus previous drop in hct have been dilutional.
   - Continue to follow on AM labs.
 FEVER
   Pt now afebrile and white count down. Cultures from [**7-28**] showed
   pseudomonas.
   -Continue ceftazidime for total of 14d course.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pt is afebrile.
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   x 2 showed no growth.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.  Phenobarbitol level therapeutic.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear
   uncomfortable now.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and chronic aspiration events who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure following an aspiration event. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. The patient has been experiencing labored breathing and excessive secretions in the upper airways. His oxygen saturation levels have been around 94%. The sputum culture showed pseudomonas, so he is being treated with ceftazidime for a total of two weeks. Other medications include bronchodilators to reduce large airway inflammation, scopolamine patch to decrease oropharyngeal secretions, and frequent suctioning and chest physiotherapy for pulmonary hygiene.

The patient's hematocrit levels have decreased, but there is no clear source of bleeding, and it is believed to be dilutional. He is also at risk for developing pulmonary edema, so his intake and output will be closely monitored, and lasix will be used as needed.

The patient is now afebrile, and his white blood cell count has decreased. He has a history of dementia and is currently not on any medications for it. He also has stage I sacral and heel ulcers, for which he will be placed on an air mattress and repositioned every hour. The patient's arthritis pain will be managed with APAP.

ICU care includes nutrition support through a feeding tube and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes mellitus, who presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and coughing up brownish phlegm. On admission, he was found to have an elevated white blood cell count and a positive culture from the wound around his tracheostomy site, indicating an infection. He was started on antibiotics and received intravenous fluids. His condition has been stable, with improved urine output. However, he experienced a low urine output episode overnight and received 500 mL of normal saline. The patient's vital signs remain within normal limits, except for low blood pressure. He is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's lab results show elevated glucose levels and a slightly low platelet count. His coagulation profile is within normal limits. The patient's nutritional support has been initiated. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or quantity, will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins. Prophylactic measures,"

   Assessment and Plan
   83yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday.
   Chemical pneumonitis was the most likely etiology of the respiratory
   distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU. Today, breathing is
   labored and pt has a lot of secretions in upper airways that he is not
   able to clear because he doesn
t have an effective cough. Desaturates
   to low 90% when laboring to clear secretions, however nurses have been
   able to manage secretions with suctioning every few hours. CXR from
   today is stable. WBC count down, pt is afebrile.
   - Sputum culture from [**7-28**] showed pseudomonas. Continue ceftazidime for
   total of 2 week course, via new midline that was placed this morning.
   - Continue frequent bronchodilators in effort to reduce large airway
   inflammation.
   - Continue scopolamine patch in hopes of decreasing oropharyngeal
   secretions.
   - Continue to hold steroids, as pt has no hx of COPD and exam is stable
   without them.
   - Continue frequent suctioning and chest PT for pulmonary hygiene.
   - Keep i/o
s even today to avoid developing pulmonary edema; use lasix
   as needed.
 Purulence from j-tube site
   Moderate amount of tan-brown purulence. Wound gram stain showed 2+ PMNs
   and 1+ yeast. Pt remained afebrile and WBC relatively stable. Only
   minor exudate this AM and some tenderness.
   - f/u wound culture.
   - keep dressing clean, dry, and intact.
   - monitor for signs of infection.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Increased to 36 then 34.8 this AM. No clear source of bleeding (Guaiac
   negative). MCV normal and no clear reason to believe there
s decreased
   production. Thus previous drop in hct have been dilutional.
   - Continue to follow on AM labs.
 FEVER
   Pt now afebrile and white count down. Cultures from [**7-28**] showed
   pseudomonas.
   -Continue ceftazidime for total of 14d course.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pt is afebrile.
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   x 2 showed no growth.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.  Phenobarbitol level therapeutic.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear
   uncomfortable now.

         WOUND CULTURE (Pending)
   Assessment and Plan
   83yo man with hx of dementia, seizure d/o, chronic aspiration events
   with PEG since [**2-27**] who was transferred from rehab facility ([**Hospital 1072**]) in respiratory distress in the setting of an aspiration event.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   Failure developed following a gross aspiration event on Sunday.
   Chemical pneumonitis was the most likely etiology of the respiratory
   distress that brought Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the ICU. Today, breathing is
   labored and pt has a lot of secretions in upper airways that he is not
   able to clear because he doesn
t have an effective cough. Desaturates
   to low 90% when laboring to clear secretions, however nurses have been
   able to manage secretions with suctioning every few hours. CXR from
   today is stable. WBC count down, pt is afebrile.
   - Sputum culture from [**7-28**] showed pseudomonas. Continue ceftazidime for
   total of 2 week course, via new midline that was placed this morning.
   - Exchange albuterol for xopinex prn for wheezing. Xopinex has more
   airway selectivity which will hopefully help avoid SVT.
   - Continue scopolamine patch in hopes of decreasing oropharyngeal
   secretions.
   - Continue to hold steroids, as pt has no hx of COPD and exam is stable
   without them.
   - Continue suctioning and chest PT for pulmonary hygiene.
   - Keep i/o
s even today to avoid developing pulmonary edema; use lasix
   as needed.
 Purulence from j-tube site
   Moderate amount of tan-brown purulence. Wound gram stain showed 2+ PMNs
   and 1+ yeast. Pt remained afebrile and WBC relatively stable. Only
   minor exudate this AM and some tenderness. Drainage is likely because
   tube was down-sized when PEG was converted to j-tube, thus oozing is
   likely to continue as site heals slowly.
   - reassure nursing home that oozing does not necessarily indicate
   dangerous infection.
   - monitor for signs of infection.
   - keep dressing clean, dry, and intact.
   - f/u wound culture.
 Decreased hematocrit
   Increased to 36 then 34.8 this AM. No clear source of bleeding (Guaiac
   negative). MCV normal and no clear reason to believe there
s decreased
   production. Thus previous drop in hct have been dilutional.
   - Continue to follow on AM labs.
 FEVER
   Pt now afebrile and white count down. Cultures from [**7-28**] showed
   pseudomonas.
   -Continue ceftazidime for total of 14d course.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI): Pt is afebrile.
   - UA times 2 shows lg WBCs, mod leuks concerning for UTI, but urine cx
   x 2 showed no growth.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
   On phenobarbital at home. No report of seizure like activity at NH,
   prior to episode of aspiration.  Phenobarbitol level therapeutic.
   - Continue home regimen phenobarbitol.
 SKIN BREAKDOWN (PRESENT AT ADMISSION)
   Stage I sacral ulcer, stage II R heel ulcer, stage I L ankle ulcer.
   - Air mattress, frequent repositioning q1 hr.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Pt on no meds for advanced dementia, had previously been on celexa,
   remeron, zyprexa over a year ago.
   - No meds for now
 ARTHRITIS, OSTEO (OSTEOARTHRITIS, OA)
   Patient on APAP at NH for pain control, but does not appear
   uncomfortable now.
 FEN
   Continue fluid boluses as needed to maintain urine output roughly
   30cc/hr and I
s roughly even.

","The patient is an 83-year-old man with a history of dementia, seizure disorder, and chronic aspiration events who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress caused by aspiration. He has been receiving tube feeds through a PEG tube. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, purulence from the j-tube site, decreased hematocrit, fever, urinary tract infection, seizure, skin breakdown, dementia, and osteoarthritis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and labored breathing may lead to further deterioration of lung function and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of purulence at the j-tube site and the previous growth of pseudomonas in the sputum culture indicate a risk of infection. This could potentially lead to sepsis or localized infection.
3. Decreased hematocrit: The decrease in hematocrit levels may indicate anemia or blood loss. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. UTI: Although the patient is currently afebrile, the presence of leukocytes in the urine suggests a possible urinary tract infection. This should be monitored and treated accordingly.
5. Seizure: The patient's seizure activity should be managed with appropriate anticonvulsant therapy.
6. Skin breakdown: The presence of stage I and II pressure ulcers increases the risk of infection and delayed"
