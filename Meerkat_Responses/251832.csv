   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female admitted initially with evidence of SVC syndrome and was
   intubated for bronchoscopy for tissue diagnosis who had SCCA lung
   identified on bronchoscopy.  She has retained relatively high airway
   pressures and was unable to be extubated successfully.  Biopsy was
   obtained through rigid bronch via thoracic surgery.   Given the SCCA
   complicated by SVC syndrome patient now transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] for further
   care and treatment planning.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with background of chronic pain and quite
   elevated levels of sedation have been required.
   -Will maintain A/C support
   -Will maintain relative elevation of PEEP to work to preserve
   oxygenation but not to the extent that we will re-contribute to
   overdistention which was seen overnight with higher tidal volumes
   -Vt at 400 with Pplat=22 appears quite favorable
   -Do suspect possible intrapulmonary shunt as we have some significant
   and persistent hypoxemia as well
   -Will remain intubated for now
   2)Squamous Cell Carcinoma-
   -Rad-Onc consultation-will provide outside images
   -Oncology Consultation
   -Will have to update family in light of evaluation
   -IP consultation for bronch to evaluate airways
   -Will obtain path from [**Hospital3 1959**] and report to be faxed now
   3)SVC Syndrome-
   -Will continue on steroids as dosed and suggested

","The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted with evidence of Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome and was intubated for bronchoscopy to obtain a tissue diagnosis. SCCA (squamous cell carcinoma) was identified on bronchoscopy. The patient has retained relatively high airway pressures and was unable to be extubated successfully. A biopsy was obtained through rigid bronchoscopy via thoracic surgery. Due to the SCCA complicated by SVC syndrome, the patient is being transferred to another hospital for further care and treatment planning.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient's background of chronic pain and elevated levels of sedation have required maintenance of assisted/controlled (A/C) support. The healthcare team will continue to maintain A/C support, relative elevation of PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) to work on preserving oxygenation without causing overdistention, Vt (tidal volume) at 400 with Pplat (plateau pressure) of 22, which appears favorable. There is suspicion of a possible intrapulmonary shunt due to significant and persistent hypoxemia.
2) Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The patient will receive a consultation with a radiation oncologist, oncology consultation, and an interventional pulmonology (IP) consultation to evaluate the airways. The path report from another hospital will be obtained and faxed.
3) SVC Syndrome: The patient will continue"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evauluation.
   #  Respiratory Failure:  The patient has a high a-A gradient (262.5)
   while on FiO2 of 60%.  Likely this is secondary to shunt physiology,
   perfusion of collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive
   atelectasis in RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve
   with recruitment trials until cause of collapse is addressed (see
   below).    Patient to go for endobronchial stenting in am [**11-13**].  In the
   meantime, will attempt to maintain adequate oxygenation.  Her PIP and
   Plateau pressures are also elevated on her current ventilator
   settings.  Will attempt to decrease fi02 to decrease oxygen toxicity
   and surgical risk.  Will check ABG to assess in a few hours.
   - transfer to west by tomorrow am for stenting
   - will need to discuss need for such high-dose methylpred with rad/onc
   or whoever suggested it

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma, causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation. The patient has respiratory failure due to shunt physiology caused by collapsed lung on the right upper and middle lobes, as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe. Endobronchial stenting is planned to address the cause of collapse. The patient is currently on high-dose methylprednisolone, which needs to be discussed with the radiation oncology team. She also has chronic back pain secondary to scoliosis and tobacco abuse. The patient is receiving tube feeds and has been started on a bowel regimen. She is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient while on FiO2 of 60%. This indicates shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung, and compressive atelectasis. The fixed defect will not improve with recruitment trials until the cause of collapse is addressed. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the endobronchial stenting procedure is unsuccessful or if the patient develops complications such as pneumonia or worsening SVC syndrome.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evauluation.
   .
   #.  Respiratory Failure:  The patient has a high a-A gradient (262.5)
   while on FiO2 of 60%.  Likely this is secondary to shunt physiology,
   perfusion of collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive
   atelectasis in RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve
   with recruitment trials until cause of collapse is addressed (see
   below).  Will consider repeat bronchoscopy in the AM to address other
   possible causes of collapse including mucous plugging.  Also, the
   patient may be a candidate for endobronchial stenting as a bridge to
   definitive cancer therapy.  In the meantime, will attempt to maintain
   adequate oxygenation.  Her PIP and Plateau pressures are also elevated
   on her current ventilator settings.  Will attempt to decreased tidal
   volumes to improve pressures.  Will check ABG to assess in a few
   hours.
   - CXR in AM
   - Consider bronch in AM
   - Consider IP consult for stenting if bronch shows signs of proximal
   airway collapse.
   - Continue fentanyl/versed for sedation/pain control
   .
   #.  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer:  New diagnosis in the past two days.
   Will consult Onc and Rad/Onc in the AM for more definitive therapy
   options.  Likely the patient will require both radiation and
   chemotherapy to decrease the tumor burden and hopefully relieve airway
   collapse.  Initial metastatic workup has been negative with negative
   Abd and Brain imaging.
   - Consult Onc
   - Consult Rad/Onc
   - Attempt to get pathology from [**Hospital6 **]
   - Bring CD of CT to our radiology dept
   - Consider SW consult for coping with difficult new diagnosis
   .
   #.  SVC Syndrome:  Secondary to lung mass and bulkly lymphadenopathy.
   Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.  As above, will
   likely improve as tumor burden addressed.
   .
   #.  Chronic Back pain:  Secondary to scoliosis.  Continue fentanyl
   while sedated.  Can transition back to home oxycodone once off
   sedation.
   .
   #.  Tobacco Abuse:  Continue nicotine patch.
   .
   .
   FEN:  Tubefeeding per nutrition consult, replete lytes PRN, insulin ss
   while on steroids.
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with hep sc tid
   -Bowel regimen  senna and colace
   -Pain management with fentanyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma. She has been experiencing respiratory failure due to SVC syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high a-A gradient while on FiO2 of 60%. This indicates shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung, and compressive atelectasis. It is important to address the cause of collapse and consider repeat bronchoscopy to address possible causes of collapse, such as mucous plugging or endobronchial stenting as a bridge to definitive cancer therapy.

2. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer. Consultation with Oncology and Radiation Oncology is recommended for more definitive therapy options. The patient may require both radiation and chemotherapy to decrease the tumor burden and relieve airway collapse.

3. SVC Syndrome: The patient has SVC syndrome secondary to lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy. IV steroids should be continued to decrease inflammation, and the tumor burden needs to be addressed for improvement.

4. Chronic Back Pain: The patient has chronic back pain secondary to scoliosis. Fentanyl can be continued for pain management while sedated, and transitioned back to home oxycodone once off sedation.

5. Tobacco Abuse: The patient has a history of tobacco abuse, and nicotine patch"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute; non-small cell lung cancer; SVC syndrome; and chronic back pain. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high arterial-alveolar (a-A) gradient while on supplemental oxygen, indicating shunt physiology due to collapsed lung on the right upper and middle lobes, as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe. This may lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or worsening hypoxemia.

2. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer, which may progress and lead to metastasis. This could result in additional complications such as bone pain, brain metastases, or liver involvement.

3. SVC Syndrome: The patient has SVC syndrome secondary to the lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy. This can cause swelling of the face, neck, and upper extremities, leading to potential airway compromise or facial congestion.

4. Chronic Back Pain: The patient has chronic back pain due to scoliosis. This may limit mobility and increase the risk of pressure ulcers or deep vein thromb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an obstructing lesion in the right middle and upper lobes, causing collapse. She is intubated and experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to her obstruction and collapse. She underwent two sessions of X-ray therapy and was transferred from another hospital ward for a rigid bronchoscopy and stent placement.

24-hour events:
- The patient developed a fever of 100.6 degrees overnight and had mild hypotension, which resolved with a 500ml bolus.
- She received midazolam (versed) and fentanyl infusions, as well as famotidine (pepcid) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).
- Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission.
- Her vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 65-112 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 79/46 to 138/70 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%.

Physical examination:
- The patient is sedated and opens her eyes to voice.
- She has neck swelling, which is firm and consistent with known tumor and adenopathy.
- Chest examination reveals bronchial breath sounds in the right upper lobe and inspiratory high-pitched sound in the same area.
- Cardiovascular examination shows regular rate and rhythm"

   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in rt main
   bronchus and XRT x 2.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure:  The patient has a high a-A gradient, likely
   is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung of RUL
   and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in RLL.  This is likely a
   fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials while patient
   undergoing XRT that is likely to cause further edema and
   inflammation.    Patient s/p endobronchial stenting on [**11-13**] in
   preparation for inflammation/edema that will likely be caused by
   continued XRT.
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS while on steroids
   - Patient to likely need trach; plan for discussion with family in
   conjunction with oncology team

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma, causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy with placement of a right mainstem stent in preparation for likely edema from ongoing radiation therapy (XRT). She tolerated the procedure well and has received two doses of XRT so far. The patient's pain is managed with fentanyl, and she is also on midazolam for sedation. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 127/61 to 159/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on endotracheal tube with supplemental oxygen. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of plethoric face, neck edema, dilated veins over the neck and chest, and 1+ edema in upper extremities bilaterally. 

Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, normal electrolyte levels, and normal kidney and liver function tests. The chest X-ray reveals good placement of the endotracheal tube, stable right upper and middle lung fields, and slightly"

   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma. The patient is currently in the ICU due to SVC syndrome and respiratory distress. She has undergone stenting of the right main bronchus and has received two treatments of XRT.

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, non-small cell lung cancer, SVC syndrome, chronic back pain, and tobacco abuse. 

Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high a-A gradient, likely secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung, and compressive atelectasis. This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials while the patient undergoes XRT.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer. She has already received two treatments of XRT since November 11th. The initial metastatic workup has been negative, but there are likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging.

SVC Syndrome: The patient has SVC syndrome secondary to the lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy. IV steroids will continue to decrease inflammation, and the condition is expected to improve as the tumor burden is addressed.

LUE Swelling: The patient has LUE swelling, which is likely due to SVC syndrome. It will be monitored continuously.

Chronic Back Pain: The patient has chronic back pain secondary to scoliosis. Fentanyl will be continued while sedated, and the"

   - needs PICC today
   - XRT today and Wednesday, then nothing scheduled
   - updated daughter with heme/onc: she seems realistic about severity of
   her mother's condition (was told that while we also HOPE for
   extubation, we think that this might not be a possibility)
   - family meeting today planned for about 2-3pm (patient's mother - a RN
   - will be there in addition to husband), rad onc did not return page
   but ideally they and med onc should be there
   - switched from versed to propofol overnight so patient could try to
   explain own wishes in am
   - CDs of CT scan in med chart for med onc to review

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. The patient has been transferred for further evaluation and treatment. She underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received two sessions of radiation therapy (XRT).

The patient is currently in the ICU and is intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. She has a high a-A gradient, indicating the presence of shunt physiology. This is likely due to perfusion of collapsed lung segments and compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe. The patient also has an increased right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, which is compatible with pneumonia or aspiration.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and high a-A gradient suggest a high risk of respiratory failure. This can be further exacerbated by the planned radiation therapy, which may cause further edema and inflammation.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and recent endobronchial procedure, she is at a high risk for developing VAP. The presence of tracheal secretions with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods on sputum gram stain also supports this concern.

3. Post-Obstructive Pneumonia: Due to the"

   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in rt main
   bronchus and XRT x 3.
   #  Respiratory Failure:  The patient has a high a-A gradient, likely
   is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung of RUL
   and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in RLL.  This is likely a
   fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials while patient
   undergoing XRT that is likely to cause further edema and
   inflammation.    Patient s/p endobronchial stenting on [**11-13**] in
   preparation for inflammation/edema that will likely be caused by
   continued XRT.   Do feel that hypoxemia is more substantial than chest
   xray would explain.
   - Review CT scan with radiology
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS while on steroids
   - Patient to likely need trach; plan for discussion with family in
   conjunction with oncology team this afternoon
   - Sputum Cx as pt immunocompromised with endobronchial procedure
   yesterday
 at high risk for post-obstructive pneumonia
   - Low threshold to start abx empirically for post-obstructive pneumonia
   - Continue fentanyl/propofol for sedation/pain control
   #.  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer:  New diagnosis, now s/p 2 treatments of
   XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial metastatic workup
   has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging but has likely
   positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - plan for XRT today; rad-onc to reevaluate course of treatment
   - SW consult
   - plan for family meeting with oncology team to address goals of care
   and prognosis
   - review imaging as above
   #.  SVC Syndrome:  Secondary to lung mass and bulkly lymphadenopathy.
   Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.  As above, will
   likely improve as tumor burden addressed.
   # LUE swelling: No DVT on U/S. Likely from SVC syndrome. Con't to
   monitor.
   #.  Chronic Back pain:  Secondary to scoliosis.  Continue fentanyl
   while sedated.  Can transition back to home oxycodone once off

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent placement of a stent in her right main bronchus and received three sessions of external beam radiation therapy (XRT).

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), constipation, SVC syndrome, tobacco use, and cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, specifically non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to improve oxygenation.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 51 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 210. Her white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated at 13.3 K/uL, and she has an increased platelet count of 490 K/uL. The results of her gram stain from a sputum sample indicate the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, along with gram-negative rods.

The patient's chest X-ray reveals findings consistent with atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL). The CT scan with contrast shows multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, but no evidence of distant metast"

   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in rt main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
   #  Respiratory Failure:  The patient has a high a-A gradient, likely
   is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung of RUL
   and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in RLL.  This is likely a
   fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials while patient
   undergoing XRT that is likely to cause further edema and
   inflammation.    Patient s/p endobronchial stenting on [**11-13**] in
   preparation for inflammation/edema that will likely be caused by
   continued XRT.   Do feel that hypoxemia is more substantial than chest
   xray would explain.  CXR this AM suggestive of worsening rt sided
   effusion.
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS while on steroids
   - Patient to likely need trach; plan for discussion with family in
   conjunction with oncology team this afternoon
   - Sputum Cx shows CPCs and GNRs; pt at high risk for post-obstructive
   pneumonia, but will wait for culture or clinic change to start Abx
   - Continue fentanyl/propofol for sedation/pain control
   - Per RT, patient having apneic episodes; will change to AC mode after
   family meeting today
   .
   # Emesis: Several episodes of brown emesis this AM; per nursing pt
   likely aspirated.  Unclear cause of nausea, but possibilities include
   pancreatitis, irritation from ET tube in setting of decreased sedation.
   - check amylase/lipase
   - check triglycerides; if elevated will need to switch from propofol to
   other sedating medication
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
   #.  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4 treatments of
   XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial metastatic workup
   has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging but has likely
   positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - plan for XRT today; rad-onc to reevaluate course of treatment
   - SW consult
   - plan for family meeting with oncology team to address goals of care
   and prognosis
   #.  SVC Syndrome:  Secondary to lung mass and bulkly lymphadenopathy.
   Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.  As above, will
   likely improve as tumor burden addressed.
   # LUE swelling: No DVT on U/S. Likely from SVC syndrome. Con't to
   monitor.
   #.  Chronic Back pain:  Secondary to scoliosis.  Continue fentanyl
   while sedated.  Can transition back to home oxycodone once off
   sedation.
   #.  Tobacco Abuse:  Continue nicotine patch

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma, causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received X-ray therapy four times. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung on the right upper and middle lobes, and compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe. The patient also has constipation, tobacco use, acute respiratory failure, chronic back pain, and SVC syndrome. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high a-A gradient, likely secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung, and compressive atelectasis. This can lead to worsening hypoxemia and potential need for tracheostomy.
2. Infection: The sputum culture shows presence of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, indicating a high risk for post-obstructive pneumonia. There may be a need for antibiotic treatment based on culture results.
3. Aspiration: The patient has had several episodes of brown emesis, which may indicate aspiration. It is important to assess the patient's swallowing function and consider the need for airway protection measures such as tracheostomy.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be due to pancreatitis, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) who is experiencing respiratory distress due to superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) and has been transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received XRT. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of tobacco use, chronic back pain, and is currently being treated for SVC syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to shunt physiology caused by collapsed lung of the right upper and middle lobes, as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe. This condition may not improve with recruitment trials while the patient undergoes XRT, which is likely to cause further edema and inflammation.

2. Emesis: The patient has had several episodes of brown emesis, which may indicate aspiration. Possible causes include pancreatitis, irritation from the endotracheal tube, or decreased sedation. Amylase levels are elevated, possibly due to secretions from the oropharynx, while lipase levels are within normal range. Reglan and Zofran have been ordered for nausea management.

3. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): The patient has a new diagnosis of NSCLC, for which she has received four treatments of XRT"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma. She presented with superior vena cava syndrome and respiratory distress, for which she was transferred to the ICU. The patient has undergone stenting of the right main bronchus and radiation therapy.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to shunt physiology, likely caused by collapsed lung segments and compressive atelectasis. She has been started on steroids to decrease inflammation and is at high risk for post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is also experiencing episodes of nausea and vomiting, possibly due to pancreatitis or irritation from the endotracheal tube.

The patient has a history of lung cancer with metastatic workup negative except for positive lymph nodes based on imaging. Her XRT is complete, and she will receive a palliative care consult. The patient has a fever, which could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia or possibly cancer-related myeloidosis (CMO). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 142/67 to 70s, heart rate between 90-109 bpm, respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. Her arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.54, PaCO2 of 37, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 200.

      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).
   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):
      Further incubation required to determine the presence or absence of
      commensal respiratory flora.
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    MODERATE GROWTH.
   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in rt main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely  is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now possibly with post-obstructive pneumonia with
   fever and GNR on sputum culture.
   - Start Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro IV for HAP and possibly VAP for total 8 day
   course, can consider stopping Vanc if no GPC in the sputum culture
   - Repeat sputum cx today
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS while on steroids
   - Continue fentanyl for sedation, will stop propofol as not helping.
   Can bolus midazolam/lorazepam if needed for anxiety or sedation.
   - Will readdress goals of care with family regarding desires for Abx
   treatment, blood draws, transfusions, etc.
   - Palliative care following
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Several episodes of brown emesis this AM; per
   nursing pt likely aspirated.  Unclear cause of nausea, but
   possibilities include pancreatitis, irritation from ET tube in setting
   of decreased sedation.
   - amylase high, may be due to secretions from oropharynx, lipase wnl
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete, palliative care to see her today
   - SW following
 FEVER: Could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI
   consistent with infection.
   - Start Abx as above to cover both pneumonia and UTI
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulkly
   lymphadenopathy.  Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.
   As above, will likely improve as tumor burden addressed.
   # LUE swelling: No DVT on U/S. Likely from SVC syndrome. Con't to
   monitor.
   #.  Chronic Back pain:  Secondary to scoliosis.  Continue fentanyl
   while sedated.  Can transition back to home oxycodone once off
   sedation.
   #.  Tobacco Abuse:  Continue nicotine patch

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient has undergone stent placement in the right main bronchus and radiation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient has a high a-A gradient, likely secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung of right upper and middle lobes, as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe. This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. Now possibly with post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and gram-negative rods on sputum culture.
2. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient has had several episodes of brown emesis this morning; per nursing, the patient likely aspirated. Unclear cause of nausea, but possibilities include pancreatitis, irritation from endotracheal tube in the setting of decreased sedation.
3. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Lung NSCLC: New diagnosis, now s/p 4 treatments of XRT since [11-11]. Heme/Onc also following. Initial metastatic workup has been negative with negative abdominal and brain imaging but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging.
4. Fever: Could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia and also had a urinary tract infection consistent with infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in rt main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely  is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing Enterobacter.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro IV for HAP and possibly VAP for total 8
   day course (today is day 2), can consider stopping Vanc tomorrow if no
   GPC in the sputum culture
   - Repeat sputum cx today
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS while on steroids
   - Continue fentanyl for sedation, have stopped propofol.  Can bolus
   midazolam/lorazepam if needed for anxiety or sedation.
   - Will assess for possibility of trach placement by IP in the future
   given patient
s wishes to prolong current condition for a while
   - Palliative care following
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis.
   - amylase high, may be due to secretions from oropharynx, lipase wnl
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete
   - Heme/onc following, will get CT chest soon to evaluate current state
   of lungs/cancer.  Meeting with onc today planned for 3:30pm.
   - SW following
   - Palliative care following
   # CONSTIPATION: Still with constipation and some small episodes of
   diarrhea.  Likely is related to high doses of fentanyl.
   - KUB today to assess for obstruction
 FEVER: Could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI
   consistent with infection.
   - Continue Abx as above to cover both pneumonia and UTI
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulkly
   lymphadenopathy.  Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.
   Swelling looks somewhat decreased since admission.
   # LUE swelling: No DVT on U/S. Likely from SVC syndrome. Con't to
   monitor.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received external beam radiation therapy (XRT) four times.

The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is likely due to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung on the right upper lobe (RUL) and middle lobe (RML), as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL). This is a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. The patient also has post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and a gram-negative rod (GNR) on sputum culture, growing Enterobacter.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin (Vanc), cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) for a total of an 8-day course. Vanc can be stopped tomorrow if there are no gram-positive cocci (GPC) in the sputum culture. The patient will have a repeat sputum culture today.

The patient is also on steroids to decrease inflammation from SVC syndrome and is scheduled to meet with an oncologist today at 3:30 pm."

   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in rt main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely  is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now possibly with post-obstructive pneumonia with
   fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing Enterobacter
   - Start Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro IV for HAP and possibly VAP for total 8 day
   course, can consider stopping Vanc if no GPC in the sputum culture
   - Repeat sputum cx today
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS while on steroids
   - Continue fentanyl for sedation, will stop propofol as not helping.
   Can bolus midazolam/lorazepam if needed for anxiety or sedation.
   - Will readdress goals of care with family regarding desires for Abx
   treatment, blood draws, transfusions, etc.
   - Palliative care following
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Several episodes of brown emesis this AM; per
   nursing pt likely aspirated.  Unclear cause of nausea, but
   possibilities include pancreatitis, irritation from ET tube in setting
   of decreased sedation.
   - amylase high, may be due to secretions from oropharynx, lipase wnl
   - standing reglan, zofran prn

   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete, palliative care to see her today
   - SW following
 FEVER: Could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI
   consistent with infection.
   - Start Abx as above to cover both pneumonia and UTI
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulkly
   lymphadenopathy.  Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.
   As above, will likely improve as tumor burden addressed.
   # LUE swelling: No DVT on U/S. Likely from SVC syndrome. Con't to
   monitor.
   #.  Chronic Back pain:  Secondary to scoliosis.  Continue fentanyl
   while sedated.  Can transition back to home oxycodone once off

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) causing superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) and respiratory distress. She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. The patient has been receiving various interventions, including placement of a stent in the right main bronchus, radiation therapy (XRT), and administration of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to shunt physiology, collapsed lung on the right upper lobe (RUL) and middle lobe (RML), and compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL). This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. The patient may require prolonged mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive sputum culture for gram-negative rods (GNR) and gram-positive cocci (GPC), indicating a bacterial infection. She has been started on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for HAP and possibly VAP. The Enterobacter aerogenes isolated from the respiratory culture may develop resistance to third"

   24 Hour Events:
   - IP wanted CT neck to evaluate, also ordered CT chest for onc.  CT
   chest showed bigger right pleural effusion, stable mass and RUL
   collapse and new left infiltrate per our read
   - Rads wet read of chest CT: tumor mass similar, but has developed
   increased SVC obstruction and now with thrombus in central veins so SVC
   more or less gone and collateralizing, some in front of her trachea so
   might be bloody to give her a trach, right pleural effusion the same,
   new left lower lobe atelectasis/consolidation
   - Family meeting held at 3pm.  Plan for trach/PEG/thoracentesis on
   Monday, with chemotherapy a possible option in the distant future but
   will not address until after trach/peg.
   - Will also need thoracentesis on monday to evaluate effusion again

         This organism may develop resistance to third generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in rt main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely  is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive
   enterobacter
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime for now (cipro stoped) IV for HAP and possibly
   VAP for total 8 day course (today is day 3), can consider stopping Vanc
   today in PM if no GPC in the sputum culture
   - Will change vent to PS and send ABG
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS while on steroids
   - Continue fentanyl for sedation, have stopped propofol.  Can bolus
   midazolam/lorazepam if needed for anxiety or sedation.
   - Speak with IP regarding possibility of trach/peg placement on monday
   - Palliative care following
   .
   # RIJ and SVC clot: Will start heparin drip given CT [**Location (un) **] of
   thrombus in SVC.  PICC line in SVC continues to work, and will leave in
   place for now.
   .
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis. Amylase high, may be due to secretions from
   oropharynx, lipase wnl.
   - will stop OG suction and see if nausea/vomiting resumes
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete
   - Heme/onc following, will touch base re final read of Chest CT
   - SW following
   - Palliative care following
   # CONSTIPATION: Still with constipation and some small episodes of
   diarrhea.  Likely is related to high doses of fentanyl.
   - bowel regimen with senna, colace, bisacodyl, miralax
 FEVER: Could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI
   consistent with infection.
   - Continue Abx as above to cover both pneumonia and UTI
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulkly
   lymphadenopathy.  Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.
   Swelling looks somewhat decreased since admission.
   # LUE swelling: Likely from SVC syndrome and thrombi. Con't to monitor.
   #.  Chronic Back pain:  Secondary to scoliosis.  Continue fentanyl
   while sedated.  Can transition back to home oxycodone once off
   sedation.
   #.  Tobacco Abuse:  Continue nicotine patch

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma, causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent stent placement in the right main bronchus and received external beam radiation therapy (XRT) four times.

The patient's current assessment includes:
- Respiratory failure, acute: The patient has a high a-A gradient, likely due to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung of right upper lobe (RUL) and right middle lobe (RML), as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL). This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and gram-negative rods (GNR) on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive enterobacter. 
- Continue vancomycin (Vanc) and cefepime for now (cipro stopped) intravenously for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) for a total of an 8-day course (today is day 3), can consider stopping Vanc today in PM if no gram-positive cocci (GPC) in the sputum culture.
- Will change ventilator mode to pressure support (PS) and send arterial blood gas (ABG).
- Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, inhaled"

- The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of cancer and current presentation in the ICU.
- She has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, due to lung cancer (NSCLC) with right upper lobe collapse and new left infiltrate.
- The patient also has SVC syndrome, likely caused by the tumor mass obstructing the superior vena cava.
- She is on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 set at 60% and PEEP at 5 cmH2O.
- Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate between 93-106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/80 mmHg to 138/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal sodium and potassium levels, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal liver function tests.
- The patient's family has been informed about the plan for tracheostomy (trach), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and thoracentesis on Monday.
- Possible future options include chemotherapy, but it will not be addressed until after the trach/PEG.

         This organism may develop resistance to third generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore, isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in rt main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely  is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing Enterobacter.
   - Continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro IV for HAP and possibly VAP for total 8
   day course (today is day 2), can consider stopping Vanc tomorrow if no
   GPC in the sputum culture
   - Repeat sputum cx today
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS while on steroids
   - Continue fentanyl for sedation, have stopped propofol.  Can bolus
   midazolam/lorazepam if needed for anxiety or sedation.
   - Will assess for possibility of trach placement by IP in the future
   given patient
s wishes to prolong current condition for a while
   - Palliative care following
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis.
   - amylase high, may be due to secretions from oropharynx, lipase wnl
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete
   - Heme/onc following, will get CT chest soon to evaluate current state
   of lungs/cancer.  Meeting with onc today planned for 3:30pm.
   - SW following
   - Palliative care following
   # CONSTIPATION: Still with constipation and some small episodes of
   diarrhea.  Likely is related to high doses of fentanyl.
   - KUB today to assess for obstruction
 FEVER: Could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI
   consistent with infection.
   - Continue Abx as above to cover both pneumonia and UTI
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulkly
   lymphadenopathy.  Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.
   Swelling looks somewhat decreased since admission.
   # LUE swelling: No DVT on U/S. Likely from SVC syndrome. Con't to
   monitor.
   #.  Chronic Back pain:  Secondary to scoliosis.  Continue fentanyl
   while sedated.  Can transition back to home oxycodone once off
   sedation.
   #.  Tobacco Abuse:  Continue nicotine patch

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma, causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute on chronic, likely secondary to shunt physiology due to collapsed lung on the right upper lobe (RUL) and right middle lobe (RML), as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL). She also has post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and gram-negative rods (GNR) on sputum culture, growing Enterobacter.

The patient is receiving IV antibiotics (Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro) for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) for a total of 8-day course. The plan is to continue these antibiotics and repeat sputum culture today. Steroids have been continued to decrease inflammation, and the patient is being monitored for tracheostomy placement in the future.

The patient is also experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to medication effects or radiation gastritis. Amylase levels are high, possibly due to secretions from the oropharynx, while lipase levels are within normal range. The patient is on Reglan and Zofran as needed.

The patient has a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC"

   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in rt main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely  is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive
   enterobacter
   - Continue Cefepime for now (cipro and Vanc stoped) IV for HAP and
   possibly VAP for total 8 day course (today is day 4)
   - continue current ventilator settings
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS not needed as blood
   glucose WNL
   - Continue fentanyl for sedation, have stopped propofol.  Can bolus
   midazolam/lorazepam if needed for anxiety or sedation.

   # RIJ and SVC clot: CT [**Location (un) **] of thrombus in SVC.  PICC line in SVC
   continues to work, and will leave in place for now.
   -continue Heparin gtt
   -confirm OR time to determine when should be shut off
   -check TSH/fT4 given ischemic findings of thyroid

 FEVER: Could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI
   consistent with infection.
   - change to Ceftriaxone instead of Cefepime since covers enterobacter
   and coag neg staph
   - with increased WBC, resent blood, urine, sputum ctxs
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis. Amylase high, may be due to secretions from
   oropharynx, lipase wnl.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) presenting with respiratory distress and superior vena cava syndrome (SVC). She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent stent placement in the right main bronchus and received XRT for four treatments. She is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to shunt physiology and post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and growth of pan-sensitive enterobacter in sputum culture.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high a-A gradient, indicating shunt physiology, likely secondary to collapsed lung of right upper and middle lobes, as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe. This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. She also has likely post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive enterobacter.
2. SVC Syndrome: Secondary to lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy. The patient is receiving IV steroids to decrease inflammation, and there is some improvement in swelling.
3. Thrombi: There is evidence of thrombi in the right internal jugular (RIJ) and superior vena cava (SVC). A PICC line in the SVC continues to work, and will be left in place for now.
4. Fever: Could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) presenting with respiratory failure, acute SVC syndrome, and nausea/vomiting. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. She has undergone stent placement in the right main bronchus and radiation therapy. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a high a-a gradient indicating shunt physiology. She also has a right-sided pleural effusion and collapsed left lower lobe of the lung. There is evidence of infection with a positive sputum culture for Enterobacter aerogenes, which is sensitive to cefepime. The patient's fever is likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics but will continue with cefepime for HAP and possibly VAP. Her nausea/vomiting has resolved, and she is off OG suction. The patient has a history of tobacco use and constipation. She requires ongoing management for SVC syndrome, chronic back pain, and tobacco abuse. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of shunt physiology, collapsed lung, and post-obstructive pneumonia. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Adjustments to ventilator settings may be required.
2. Superior vena cava syndrome (SVC): The patient's SVC syndrome is secondary to lung mass and bulky"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) causing superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient has undergone placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and has received four treatments of XRT.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, lung cancer, nausea/vomiting, fever, SVC syndrome, constipation, tobacco use, and chronic back pain.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high A-a gradient, likely secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung, and compressive atelectasis. This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. There is also likely post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive enterobacter.
   - Continue Cefepime for now (cipro and Vanc stopped) IV for HAP and possibly VAP for a total of 8-day course (today is day 4).
   - Continue current ventilator settings.
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ask patient about ISS restarting.
   - Continue fentanyl for sedation, have stopped propofol. Can bolus midazolam/lorazepam if needed for anxiety or sedation.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in right main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive
   enterobacter.
   - Have switched to ceftriaxone, today is day 5 of 8 day course (have
   stopped Cipro and Vanco)
   - Trach/PEG today with thoracentesis
   - FU thoracentesis results for cytology
   - Will readdress chemotherapy options after trach/PEG
   - Continue current ventilator settings, will try to wean tomorrow after
   procedure, may need increased FiO2 peri-procedurally today
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS not needed as blood
   glucose WNL (methylprednisolone 40mg IV q12h)
   - Continue fentanyl for sedation.  Can bolus midazolam/lorazepam if
   needed for anxiety or sedation.
   - Palliative care following, will ask them to come help with placement
   tomorrow
   # RIJ and SVC clot: CT [**Location (un) **] of thrombus in SVC.  PICC line in SVC
   continues to work, and will leave in place for now.
   - Heparin gtt on hold for now, will continue post-op
 FEVER: Could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI
   consistent with infection.
   - changed to Ceftriaxone instead of Cefepime since covers enterobacter
   and coag neg staph
   - WBC continues to increase
   - Send C Diff
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis. Amylase high, may be due to secretions from
   oropharynx, lipase wnl.
   - restart TFs after OR
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete
   - Heme/onc following
   - SW following
   - Palliative care following
   # CONSTIPATION: Still with constipation and some small episodes of
   diarrhea.  Likely is related to high doses of fentanyl.
   - bowel regimen with senna, colace, bisacodyl, miralax
   - C Diff as above
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulky
   lymphadenopathy.  Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.
   Swelling looks somewhat decreased since admission.
   #.  SOCIAL ISSUES:  Some concern that husband is not coping well with
   wife
s diagnosis.  He is currently health care proxy but has multiple
   times expressed his feelings that he feels as though his wife might as
   well die now, which is not in keeping with her current wishes.
   - SW following, appreciate their guidance
   - Will discuss with daughters and patient that husband may not be
   coping well and may not make decisions in the best interest of the
   patient

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress.
- She has been transferred for further evaluation and treatment, and has undergone placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and radiation therapy (XRT) for four sessions.
- The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to shunt physiology, collapsed lung of the right upper lobe (RUL) and middle lobe (RML), and compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL).
- She also has a fever and growth of pan-sensitive enterobacter in the sputum culture, indicating a possible infection.
- The patient has increased white blood cell count (WBC), likely secondary to infection.
- She is scheduled for a tracheostomy (Trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today, as well as a thoracentesis.
- The patient's husband is struggling to cope with the wife's diagnosis and has expressed feelings that she might as well die now, which is not in keeping with her current wishes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to shunt physiology, collapsed lung, and compressive atelectasis"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma, causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received four treatments of XRT since November 11th. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to shunt physiology, likely secondary to collapsed lung of the right upper lobe (RUL) and right middle lobe (RML), as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL). She also has post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and growth of gram-negative rods (GNR), specifically enterobacter, on sputum culture. 

The patient has been switched to ceftriaxone for antibiotic coverage, and other antibiotics have been discontinued. She is scheduled for a tracheostomy (Trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today, along with thoracentesis. The ventilator settings will be continued, and she may need to switch to assisted control (AC) mode for surgery today. 

Steroids are being continued to decrease inflammation, and the patient is receiving methylprednisolone 40mg IV every 12 hours. Fentanyl is used for sedation, and midazolam/lorazepam can be given as needed for anxiety or sedation. Pall"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in right main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive
   enterobacter.
   - Have switched to ceftriaxone, today is day 5 of 8 day course (have
   stopped Cipro and Vanco)
   - Trach/PEG today with thoracentesis
   - Continue current ventilator settings, may need to switch to AC for
   surgery today
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS not needed as blood
   glucose WNL (methylprednisolone 40mg IV q12h)
   - Continue fentanyl for sedation.  Can bolus midazolam/lorazepam if
   needed for anxiety or sedation.
   - Palliative care following
   # RIJ and SVC clot: CT [**Location (un) **] of thrombus in SVC.  PICC line in SVC
   continues to work, and will leave in place for now.
   - Heparin gtt on hold for now, will continue post-op
 FEVER: Could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI
   consistent with infection.
   - changed to Ceftriaxone instead of Cefepime since covers enterobacter
   and coag neg staph
   - WBC continues to increase
   - Send C Diff
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis. Amylase high, may be due to secretions from
   oropharynx, lipase wnl.
   - restart TFs after OR
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete
   - Heme/onc following
   - SW following
   - Palliative care following
   # CONSTIPATION: Still with constipation and some small episodes of
   diarrhea.  Likely is related to high doses of fentanyl.
   - bowel regimen with senna, colace, bisacodyl, miralax
   - C Diff as above
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulky
   lymphadenopathy.  Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.
   Swelling looks somewhat decreased since admission.
   #.  Chronic Back pain:  Secondary to scoliosis.  Continue fentanyl
   while sedated.  Can transition back to home oxycodone once off
   sedation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received 4 treatments of XRT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high A-a gradient, likely secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung of right upper lobe (RUL) and right middle lobe (RML), as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL). This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. Additionally, the patient has developed likely post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and growth of pan-sensitive enterobacter.

2. SVC Syndrome: The patient has superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) secondary to lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy. Swelling has decreased since admission, and IV steroids are being used to decrease inflammation.

3. Infection: The patient has a fever, which could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia and a urinary tract infection (UTI) consistent with infection. The WBC count is increasing, indicating an ongoing infection. The patient has been switched to ceftriaxone instead of cefepime since it covers enterobacter and coag-negative staph.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient underwent several procedures including PEG insertion, thoracentesis, and open tracheostomy. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 112 bpm, hypertension with a blood pressure of 171/79 mmHg, normal respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support, and a temperature within normal limits.

Fluid balance reveals an intake of 959 mL of fluids including 175 mL of PO fluids, 879 mL of IV fluids, and 200 mL of NG fluids. The total output includes 2,345 mL of urine, 1,095 mL of drains, and 1,250 mL of stool. The net fluid balance is -1,386 mL, indicating a fluid deficit.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 13.0 to 16.0 K/uL. Hematocrit levels are within normal limits, with a platelet count ranging from 297 to 387 K/uL. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes are within normal limits.

Pleural fluid analysis reveals a high white blood cell count of 49*103/mm3, predominantly lymphocytic with 51% lymphocytes."

   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in right main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive
   enterobacter.  Pt now s/p trach and peg.
   - Have switched to ceftriaxone (to cover coag neg staph and
   enterobacter), today is day 6 of 8 day course (have stopped Cipro and
   Vanco)
   - FU thoracentesis results for cytology
   - Will readdress chemotherapy options after trach/PEG
   - Will try to wean vent today
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS not needed as blood
   glucose WNL (methylprednisolone 40mg IV q12h)
   - Continue fentanyl for sedation.  Can bolus midazolam/lorazepam if
   needed for anxiety or sedation.
   - Palliative care following, will ask them to come help with placement
   tomorrow
   # RIJ and SVC clot: CT [**Location (un) **] of thrombus in SVC.  PICC line in SVC
   continues to work, and will leave in place for now.
   - Heparin gtt restarted
 FEVER: No fevers in > 24 hours.  Could be due to post-obstructive
   pneumonia, and also had a UTI consistent with infection.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone instead of Cefepime since covers enterobacter
   and coag neg staph
   - WBC continues to increase
   - Send C Diff
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis. Amylase high, may be due to secretions from
   oropharynx, lipase wnl.
   - restart TFs today

 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete
   - Heme/onc following
   - SW following
   - Palliative care following
   # CONSTIPATION: Still with constipation and some small episodes of
   diarrhea.  Likely is related to high doses of fentanyl.
   - bowel regimen with senna, colace, bisacodyl, miralax
   - C Diff as above
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulky
   lymphadenopathy.  Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.
   Swelling looks somewhat decreased since admission.
   #.  SOCIAL ISSUES:  Some concern that husband is not coping well with
   wife
s diagnosis.  He is currently health care proxy but has multiple
   times expressed his feelings that he feels as though his wife might as
   well die now, which is not in keeping with her current wishes.
   - SW following, appreciate their guidance

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a high a-A gradient and shunt physiology due to collapsed lung on the right upper lobe (RUL) and right middle lobe (RML), as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL). This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. The patient also has post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and gram-negative rods (GNR) on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive enterobacter. The patient has already undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

2. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome: The patient has SVC syndrome secondary to lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy. The swelling has somewhat decreased since admission, and the patient is being treated with IV steroids to decrease inflammation.

3. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung NSCLC: The patient has a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress. The patient has already received 4 treatments of external beam radiation therapy (XRT) since November 11th. The patient's metastatic workup has been negative, except for likely positive lymph nodes based on oncologic imaging.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in right main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive
   enterobacter.  Pt now s/p trach and peg.
   - Have switched to ceftriaxone (to cover coag neg staph and
   enterobacter), today is day 6 of 8 day course (have stopped Cipro and
   Vanco)
   - FU thoracentesis results for cytology
   - Will readdress chemotherapy options after trach/PEG
   - Will try to wean vent today -> will do trial of trach with f/u ABG on
   collar if patient tolerates.
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS not needed as blood
   glucose WNL (methylprednisolone 40mg IV q12h)
   - Continue fentanyl for sedation -> will change to PO dosing now that
   patient with PEG
   - Palliative care following, will ask them to come help with placement
   # RIJ and SVC clot: CT [**Location (un) **] of thrombus in SVC.  PICC line in SVC
   continues to work, and will leave in place for now.
   - Heparin gtt restarted.  Will transition to lovenox today.
 FEVER: Low grade fever to 99 this AM.  Could be due to
   post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI consistent with
   infection.  WBC trending down today.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone instead of Cefepime since covers enterobacter
   and coag neg staph
   - Send C Diff if stools.
   - change foley today as culture shows yeast
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis. Amylase high, may be due to secretions from
   oropharynx, lipase wnl.
   - start TF through PEG in PM
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
   - check ecg given standing reglan
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete
   - Heme/onc following; will discuss options for chemo
   - SW following
   - Palliative care following
   # CONSTIPATION: Still with constipation and some small episodes of
   diarrhea.  Likely is related to high doses of fentanyl.
   - bowel regimen with senna, colace, bisacodyl, miralax
   - C Diff as above
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulky
   lymphadenopathy.  Will continue IV steroids to decrease inflammation.
   Swelling looks somewhat decreased since admission.
   #.  SOCIAL ISSUES:  Some concern that husband is not coping well with
   wife
s diagnosis.  He is currently health care proxy but has multiple
   times expressed his feelings that he feels as though his wife might as
   well die now, which is not in keeping with her current wishes.
   - SW following, appreciate their guidance
   - Will discuss with daughters and patient that husband may not be
   coping well and may not make decisions in the best interest of the
   patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma, causing superior vena cava syndrome and respiratory distress. She has undergone placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and radiation therapy. The patient's recent interventions include PEG insertion, thoracentesis, and open tracheostomy. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's high a-A gradient suggests a shunt physiology, likely due to collapsed lung and compressive atelectasis. This may not improve with recruitment trials.
2. Post-obstructive Pneumonia: The patient has fever and a GNR on sputum culture, indicating a possible post-obstructive pneumonia.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a yeast infection in the Foley catheter, suggesting a UTI.
4. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, possibly due to high doses of fentanyl.
5. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC): The patient has SVC syndrome secondary to lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy. Continued IV steroids are being used to decrease inflammation.
6. Social Issues: The patient's husband is not coping well with the wife's diagnosis and may not make decisions in her best interest.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) causing superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment, and underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and radiation therapy (XRT) x 4. The patient's current health status includes acute respiratory failure, anxiety, chronic pain, fever, constipation, nausea/vomiting, and possible bleed around PEG site. She has a history of cancer, tobacco use, and previous respiratory failure. The patient's family has expressed their wishes for her care, with the husband as the health care proxy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen due to the underlying NSCLC and SVC syndrome. There is a risk of further collapse or atelectasis of the lung, leading to decreased oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Bleeding: The recent hct drop and maroon blood from the PEG tube suggest a potential bleed around the PEG site. This could be related to the use of lovenox, stomach metastases, or other factors. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to detect any further bleeding episodes.
3. Infection: The presence of fever and positive cultures for yeast and GNR in the sputum indicate a potential infection. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be maintained to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. She underwent placement of a stent in her right main bronchus and received XRT x 4. The patient also has acute respiratory failure due to shunt physiology and post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and gram-negative rod on sputum culture. She has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high a-A gradient, likely secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung of right upper lobe (RUL) and right middle lobe (RML), as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL). This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. The patient also has post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive enterobacter. 
2. Fever: The patient had a fever yesterday, but is currently afebrile. It could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia and also had a urinary tract infection (UTI) consistent with infection.
3. SVC Syndrome: The patient has secondary SVC syndrome due to lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy. She will continue with IV steroids to decrease inflammation. Swelling looks"

   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in right main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive
   enterobacter.  Pt now s/p trach and peg.
   - Have switched to ceftriaxone (to cover coag neg staph and
   enterobacter), today is day 7of 8 day course (have stopped Cipro and
   Vanco)
   - FU thoracentesis results for cytology
   - continue trachemask.  Pt. has stated clearly would not want to be
   hooked up back to machine.
   - Continue steroids to decrease inflammation, ISS not needed as blood
   glucose WNL
   - touch base with IP in AM about possibility of pleurex catheter and
   whether they think it would be useful in this case
   #  Hct drop: concerning for bleed around PEG site, especially in the
   setting of pain with  lovenox and possible stomach mets with elevated
   BUN.  Pt. now with blood out of PEG tube.
   -recheck, add on LFTs: WNL
   -active T&S
   - consult GI- patient considering whether she wants endoscopy
   -transfuse 1U and put in for post transfusion hct
   # RIJ and SVC clot: CT [**Location (un) **] of thrombus in SVC.  PICC line in SVC
   continues to work, and will leave in place for now.
   - hold lovenox given bleed
 FEVER: Yesterday am, currently afebrile.  Could be due to
   post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI consistent with
   infection.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone instead of Cefepime since covers enterobacter
   and coag neg staph
   - changed foley yesterday as culture grew yeast
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis. Amylase high, may be due to secretions from
   oropharynx, lipase wnl.
   - TFs- hold for now given bleeding
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial

Medical Complications:
1. GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   - The patient had a significant drop in hematocrit (Hct), which led to concerns about bleeding around the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site.
   - The patient received a blood transfusion and was put on hold for thromboprophylaxis.
   - Consultation with gastroenterology was sought, but endoscopy was not performed due to minimal blood loss.
   - The patient's bleeding risk may be increased due to the use of lovenox (enoxaparin) for thromboprophylaxis and possible stomach metastases with elevated BUN.

2. ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   - The patient's acute anemia is a result of the gastrointestinal bleeding.
   - Blood transfusion was given to address the anemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient has undergone placement of a stent in her right main bronchus and received four treatments of XRT.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high a-A gradient, likely due to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung, and compressive atelectasis. She also has post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and GNR on sputum culture. The patient is currently on ventilator support.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: There is concern for bleeding around the PEG site, especially in the setting of pain with lovenox and possible stomach mets with elevated BUN. The patient has blood coming out of the PEG tube. GI consultation has been requested.
3. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC): The patient has secondary SVC syndrome due to lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy. Swelling has decreased since admission, and a steroid taper is being continued.
4. Fever: The patient had a fever yesterday but is currently afebrile. It could be due to post-obstructive pneumonia or a urinary tract infection.
5. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient still has drainage out of the OG tube, but nausea/vomiting has resolved. It is likely"

   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - START [**2112-11-24**] 01:00 AM
   - Dropped Hct in AM, felt that most likely bleeding from PEG tube, gave
   1 unit blood (post transfusion 21 to 25.2), stopped lovenox, consulted
   GI for possible EGD, GI said not scoping because only loss of 50cc from
   tube.  Suggested not restarting anticoagulation.  Changed to PPI IV
   BID.
   -thoracics looked at Gtube and said bleeding from within, not around
   - if Hct stable in am, will likely retry lovenox with plan to reconsult
   GI if bleeds again.
   - pt stated HCP #1 is her husband, #2 is [**Doctor Last Name 376**]
   -plan to meet with family tomorrow to go to LTAC instead per Christines
   recs. Per nursing staff, nursing care requirements are likely too much
   for family to handle.
   - multiple BMs in pm, likely due to bleeding and constipation.  Sending
   cdiff.
   *Around 1 am, patient desatted to low-mid 80s on fi02 40% then 100% and
   was visibly uncomfortable.  She made the decision for herself to go
   back on the vent.  She was put on AC.
   - at 3am dropped BPs to SBP 70s. BP to 100 soon after.  Gave 250cc

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. The patient has undergone stenting in the right main bronchus and radiation therapy.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleed, SVC clot, fever, nausea/vomiting, cancer (NSCLC), and constipation. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has experienced multiple complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high a-a gradient, indicating impaired gas exchange. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for increased ventilatory support.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has an active infection with a growth of Gram-negative rods, suggesting a bacterial infection. This could worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of sepsis.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has a suspected bleed around the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site, which could be due to medication effects, radiation gastritis, or metastatic disease. Continued monitoring and management of the PEG site are necessary to prevent further bleeding.

4. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome: The patient's swelling has decreased since admission, but there is still a risk of worsening SVC syndrome due to the underlying lung mass and lymphadenopathy. Continued steroid tapering and"

   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - START [**2112-11-24**] 01:00 AM
   - Dropped Hct in AM, felt that most likely bleeding from PEG tube, gave
   1 unit blood (post transfusion 21 to 25.2), stopped lovenox, consulted
   GI for possible EGD, GI said not scoping because only loss of 50cc from
   tube.  Suggested not restarting anticoagulation.  Changed to PPI IV
   BID.
   -thoracics looked at Gtube and said bleeding from within, not around
   - if Hct stable in am, will likely retry lovenox with plan to reconsult
   GI if bleeds again.
   - pt stated HCP #1 is her husband, #2 is [**Doctor Last Name 376**]
   -plan to meet with family tomorrow to go to LTAC instead per Christines
   recs. Per nursing staff, nursing care requirements are likely too much
   for family to handle.
   - multiple BMs in pm, likely due to bleeding and constipation.  Sending
   cdiff.
   *Around 1 am, patient desatted to low-mid 80s on fi02 40% then 100% and
   was visibly uncomfortable.  She made the decision for herself to go
   back on the vent.  She was put on AC.
   - at 3am dropped BPs to SBP 70s. BP to 100 soon after.  Gave 250cc

   Imaging:
   CXR this am: stable right pleural effusion compared to yesterday, left
   pleural effusion and RUL collapse unchanged.
   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in right main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive
   enterobacter.  Pt now s/p trach and peg.   Patient back on ventilator
   overnight, CXR this morning does not show significant increase in rt
   pleural effusion.  Unclear why patient decompensated overnight but
   likely large anxiety component.
   - Have switched to ceftriaxone (to cover coag neg staph and
   enterobacter), today is day 8 of 8 day course (have stopped Cipro and
   Vanco)
   - transition to trach mask as tolerated
   - will speak with IP regarding possibility/ use of pleurex catheter in
   this case
   - Aggressive steroid taper (currently dex 4mg q12h)
   - will diurese today with goal 1.5 L neg to see if any improvement of
   respiratory function
   .

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB): concerning
   for bleed around PEG site, especially in the setting of pain with
   lovenox and possible stomach mets with elevated BUN.  Pt. with blood
   out of PEG tube.  Per GI, no indication to scope at present, will
   reevaluate if patient become hemodynamically unstable.
   -active T&S
   -Hct down again this AM; will transfuse 1 U and draw post-transfusion
   Hct
   -Per GI, if Hct remains stable post-transfusion then likely no need to
   scope
   -plan to restart heparin drip if post-transfusion hct stable
   .
  RIJ and SVC clot: CT [**Location (un) **] of thrombus in SVC.  PICC line in SVC
   continues to work, and will leave in place for now.
   - restart heparin as above if pt remains stable post-transfusion
   .
 FEVER: Yesterday am, currently afebrile.  Could be due to
   post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI consistent with
   infection.
   - Last day of ceftriaxone as above
   - changed foley yesterday as culture grew yeast
   .
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis. Amylase high, may be due to secretions from
   oropharynx, lipase wnl.
   - TFs- hold for now given bleeding
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
   .
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete
   - Heme/onc following; patient to follow up regarding chemo as
   outpatient if does well
   - SW following
   - Palliative care following
   .
   # CONSTIPATION: Still with constipation and some small episodes of
   diarrhea.  Multiple BMs yesterday, likely from bleeding.
   - bowel regimen with senna, colace, bisacodyl, miralax
   - will send c diff if possible
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulky
   lymphadenopathy.  Swelling looks somewhat decreased since admission.
   - Will continue steroid taper as above
   .
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Appreciate palliative care
   recs.  Was started on dilaudid PCA yesterday, but stopped when vent
   restarted.
   -IV dilaudid prn for now
   #.  SOCIAL ISSUES:  Some concern that husband is not coping well with
   wife
s diagnosis.  He is currently health care proxy but has multiple
   times expressed his feelings that he feels as though his wife might as
   well die now, which is not in keeping with her current wishes.
   - SW following, appreciate their guidance
   - on conversation this am, patient states that her HCP is first her
   husband, followed by her daughter.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava syndrome and respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has a high a-a gradient likely secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung, and compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe. This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. She also has post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and gram-negative rod (GNR) on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive enterobacter. The patient was placed on invasive ventilation and is currently on the ventilator.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly around the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site. She has blood out of the PEG tube and elevated BUN levels, which could indicate stomach metastasis. The GI consultant does not recommend endoscopy at this time and suggests monitoring the patient's hemodynamic stability.

3. Right Internal Jugular (RIJ) and Superior Vena Cava (SVC) clot: The patient has thrombosis in the SVC. A PICC line has been placed in the SVC, which continues to work, and will be left in place for"

   24 Hour Events:
    -Thoracics came by, said her PEG tube looks ok, put it to gravity and
   never wall suction, and can start using it so started using it for
   meds.  They are okay with her restarting anticoagulation whenever we
   want.
   - GI is okay with her restarting her heparin gtt this evening as long
   as no signs of active bleeding
   - Fell out of bed, covered in feces, otherwise fine
   - Post-tranfusion Hct 29 (from 24.3), restarted heparin gtt.  Early AM
   labs Hct 23.9. Gave unit and stopped heparin.
   - Gave 20mg IV Lasix this am, put out 200-300cc/hr x 4 hours, ended up
   neg 1.1 L.
   - Stayed on trache mask through the day, then got tachypneic in the
   evening, had episode of confusion, and said she was ready to die and
   visit her deceased sister-in-law but we felt like she was super tired
   and slightly confused so will readdress in the am.  Went back on vent
   to rest overnight.
   - Had conversation later about risks of eating.  She had some green
   swabs dipped in smoothie and rubbed on her lips which she loved.  She
   decided she wanted a video swallow to assess the risk of eating

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive
   enterobacter.  Pt now s/p trach and peg.   Patient back on ventilator
   overnight, CXR this morning does not show significant increase in rt
   pleural effusion.  Unclear why patient decompensated overnight but
   likely large anxiety component.
   - Completed 8 day course of Ceftriaxone (to cover coag neg staph and
   enterobacter), ended [**11-24**].
   - transition to trach mask as tolerated
   - Aggressive steroid taper -> decreased to dex 4mg daily this morning

   - finished course of ceftriaxone as above
   - changed foley as culture grew yeast
   .
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis. Amylase high, may be due to secretions from

","The patient's medical history indicates a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. The patient underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received radiation therapy (XRT). The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to shunt physiology, collapsed lung, and compressive atelectasis. There is also evidence of post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and growth of gram-negative rods (GNR) on sputum culture.

The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly around the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site, along with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased, indicating anemia. A blood transfusion was given, and the patient's post-transfusion Hct is being monitored.

The patient has a history of nausea/vomiting, which may be related to medication effects or radiation gastritis. Amylase levels are elevated, possibly due to secretions from the oropharynx. The patient's fever could be attributed to post-obstructive pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient has been diagnosed with lung cancer (malignant neoplasm), specifically non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The patient has received four treatments of XRT since November 11th. Initial metastatic workup has been negative, but there may be positive lymph nodes based on"

   24 Hour Events:
    -Thoracics came by, said her PEG tube looks ok, put it to gravity and
   never wall suction, and can start using it so started using it for
   meds.  They are okay with her restarting anticoagulation whenever we
   want.
   - GI is okay with her restarting her heparin gtt this evening as long
   as no signs of active bleeding
   - Fell out of bed, covered in feces, otherwise fine
   - Post-tranfusion Hct 29 (from 24.3), restarted heparin gtt.  Early AM
   labs Hct 23.9. Gave unit and ordered heparin.
   - Gave 20mg IV Lasix this am, put out 200-300cc/hr x 4 hours, she is
   now negative 400 since 12am
   - Stayed on trache mask through the day, then got tachypneic in the
   evening, had episode of confusion, and said she was ready to die and
   visit her deceased sister-in-law but we felt like she was super tired
   and slightly confused so will readdress in the am.  Went back on vent
   to rest overnight.
   - Had conversation later about risks of eating.  She had some green
   swabs dipped in smoothie and rubbed on her lips which she loved.  She
   decided she wanted a video swallow to assess the risk of eating

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received XRT (radiation therapy) for four treatments. She has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), with a high a-A gradient likely due to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung, and compressive atelectasis. She also has post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive enterobacter. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). She is back on ventilator overnight, and her chest X-ray this morning does not show significant increase in right pleural effusion. The cause of her decompensation overnight is unclear, but it may be related to a large anxiety component.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (melena), likely around the PEG site, especially with pain from lovenox and possible stomach metastasis with elevated BUN. Her hemoglobin levels have decreased, and she will receive a blood transfusion with plans to restart heparin if her post-transfusion hemoglobin level remains stable. There is a concern for SVC clot, and a CT scan of the thrombus in the SVC is planned. The PICC line in the SVC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of falls, confusion, and difficulty in swallowing. She has multiple medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and renal impairment. The patient has undergone various interventions and treatments such as tracheostomy, PEG tube placement, and nutritional support. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/76 to 150/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's fluid balance is negative by 1,105 mL. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to the need for mechanical ventilation and previous episodes of tachypnea and confusion. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has difficulty swallowing, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. The PEG tube placement aims to provide nutritional support, but there is still a risk of complications such as tube displacement, obstruction, or leakage.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure readings are within normal limits, but there is a history of"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in right main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now also with likely post-obstructive pneumonia
   with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive
   enterobacter.  Pt now s/p trach and peg.   Patient back on ventilator
   overnight, CXR this morning does not show significant increase in rt
   pleural effusion.  Unclear why patient decompensated overnight but
   likely large anxiety component.
   - Completed 8 day course of Ceftriaxone (to cover coag neg staph and
   enterobacter), ended [**11-24**].
   - transition to trach mask as tolerated
   - Aggressive steroid taper -> decreased to dex 4mg daily this morning
   - diuresis yesterday did not clear change respiratory function, but
   patient likely still overloaded.  Will continue to diurese with goal 2
   L neg today
   .

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB): concerning
   for bleed around PEG site, especially in the setting of pain with
   lovenox and possible stomach mets with elevated BUN.  Pt. with blood
   out of PEG tube.  Per GI, no indication to scope at present, will
   reevaluate if patient become hemodynamically unstable.   Heparin drip
   stopped.
   -active T&S
   -Hct down again this AM; will transfuse 1 U and draw post-transfusion
   Hct
   - will ask GI to scope because of need to anticoagulate given extensive
   clot burden and possibility of losing access if clot increases
   .
  RIJ and SVC clot: CT [**Location (un) **] of thrombus in SVC.  PICC line in SVC
   continues to work, and will leave in place for now.
   -  will hold on anticoagulation until GI scopes this PM
   .
 FEVER: Yesterday am, currently afebrile.  Could be due to
   post-obstructive pneumonia, and also had a UTI consistent with
   infection.
   - finished course of ceftriaxone as above
   - changed foley as culture grew yeast
   .
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: Still having drainage out of OG tube, but
   nausea/vomiting resolved.  Feel likely is related to medication effect
   or radiation gastritis. Amylase high, may be due to secretions from
   oropharynx, lipase wnl.
   - TFs- hold for now given bleeding
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
   .
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete
   - Heme/onc following; patient to follow up regarding chemo as
   outpatient if does well
   - SW following
   - Palliative care following
   .
   # CONSTIPATION: Still with constipation and some small episodes of
   diarrhea.  Multiple BMs yesterday, likely from bleeding.
   - bowel regimen with senna, colace, bisacodyl, miralax
   - will send c diff if possible
   .
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulky
   lymphadenopathy.  Swelling looks somewhat decreased since admission.
   - Will continue steroid taper as above
   .
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Appreciate palliative care
   recs.  Was started on dilaudid PCA yesterday, but stopped when vent
   restarted.
   -IV dilaudid prn for now
   .
   # Anxiety:
   -standing Ativan.
   #.  SOCIAL ISSUES:  Some concern that husband is not coping well with
   wife
s diagnosis.  He is currently health care proxy but has multiple
   times expressed his feelings that he feels as though his wife might as
   well die now, which is not in keeping with her current wishes.
   - SW following, appreciate their guidance
   - on conversation this am, patient states that her HCP is first her
   husband, followed by her daughter.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received four cycles of radiation therapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- She is experiencing respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS. The patient has a high a-a gradient, likely secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung of right upper lobe (RUL) and right middle lobe (RML), as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL). This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. There is also a possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR) on sputum culture, which is pan-sensitive enterobacter. The patient was previously on ventilator support but was transitioned to a tracheostomy mask as tolerated. She was put back on ventilator overnight, and the chest X-ray this morning does not show significant increase in right pleural effusion. It is unclear why the patient decompensated overnight, but there is a likely large anxiety component.
- She completed an 8-day course of ceftriaxone to cover coag-negative staph and enterobacter, ended on 11/24.
- The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding (PEG site) is concerning, especially in the setting of pain with lovenox and possible stomach metastases with elevated BUN. The patient has blood out of the PEG tube. The gastrointestinal (GI) department does not recommend immediate endoscopy but will reevaluate if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. Heparin drip has been stopped.
- The patient's renal function is worsening, with a decrease in hematocrit (Hct) this morning. She will receive a blood transfusion and have a post-transfusion Hct drawn.
- The patient's infection workup shows positive yeast in the urine culture and a previous negative blood culture. The pleural fluid cytology is negative for malignant cells.
- The patient's imaging shows no significant change on the chest X-ray this morning.
- The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to shunt physiology and fixed defects, gastrointestinal bleeding from the PEG site, worsening renal function, and ongoing infection.
- The patient's social issues involve her husband's coping with her diagnosis, as he has expressed feelings of hopelessness and a desire for her to pass away. The patient has designated her husband as her first healthcare proxy, followed by her daughter."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient has undergone placement of a stent in her right main bronchus and received XRT.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high A-a gradient, likely secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in RLL. This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. The patient has been treated for post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive enterobacter. She is now on a ventilator.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is concerned for bleeding around the PEG site, especially in the setting of pain with lovenox and possible stomach mets with elevated BUN. The patient has blood coming out of the PEG tube. She underwent endoscopy with intervention for an ulcer.

3. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC): The patient has secondary SVC syndrome due to lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy. Swelling looks somewhat decreased since admission. She will continue steroid taper as above.

4. Pain Control: The patient's pain control has been addressed, changing from dilaudid to oxycodone due to delirium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma, causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient has undergone placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received four cycles of radiation therapy.

Medical Complications:
1.

This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. The patient has also been treated for post-obstructive pneumonia with fever and gram-negative rods (GNR) on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive enterobacter. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation overnight after endoscopy.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is concerning for bleeding around the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site, especially in the setting of pain with low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) and possible stomach metastases with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma
   causing SVC syndrome and respiratory distress, transferred for further
   evaluation and treatment.  Now s/p placement of stent in right main
   bronchus and XRT x 4.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  The patient has a high
   a-A gradient, likely is secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of
   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now s/p tx for post-obstructive pneumonia with
   fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive enterobacter.
   Pt now s/p trach and peg.   Patient back on ventilator overnight, after
   endoscopy.
   - Completed 8 day course of Ceftriaxone (to cover coag neg staph and
   enterobacter), ended [**11-24**].
   - transition to trach mask as tolerated
   - Aggressive steroid taper -> decreased to dex 4mg yesterday, d/c now
   - diuresed >1L yesterday, now net positive 500c for LOS.  Diuresis to
   even today.
   .

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB): concerning
   for bleed around PEG site, especially in the setting of pain with
   lovenox and possible stomach mets with elevated BUN.  Pt. with blood
   out of PEG tube.  S/p endoscopy with intervention for ulcer.
   -active T&S
   - restarted Heparin yesterday, transition to lovenox today
   -[**Hospital1 7**] Hct
  RIJ and SVC clot: CT [**Location (un) **] of thrombus in SVC.  PICC line in SVC
   continues to work, and will leave in place for now.
   -  Cont Heparin, starting Lovenox this pm
   .
 NAUSEA/VOMITING: now resolved
   - TFs- consider restarting and allow patient to eat (pureed, thick liq)
    today but run past GI
   - standing reglan, zofran prn
   .
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG NSCLC:  New diagnosis, now s/p 4
   treatments of XRT since [**11-11**].  Heme/Onc also following.  Initial
   metastatic workup has been negative with negative Abd and Brain imaging
   but has likely positive lymph nodes based on OSH imaging
   - XRT complete
   - Heme/onc following; patient to follow up regarding chemo as
   outpatient if does well
   - SW following
   - Palliative care following
   .
   # CONSTIPATION:diarrhea tappering off- likely due to GIB
   - bowel regimen with senna, colace, bisacodyl, miralax
   - cdiff negative
   .
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC):  Secondary to lung mass and bulky
   lymphadenopathy.  Swelling looks somewhat decreased since admission.
   - d/c steroid today
   .
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Appreciate palliative care
   recs.  Changed to Oxycodone from dilaudid due to delerium
   .
   # Anxiety:
   -standing Ativan.
   #.  SOCIAL ISSUES:  Some concern that husband is not coping well with
   wife
s diagnosis.  He is currently health care proxy but has multiple
   times expressed his feelings that he feels as though his wife might as
   well die now, which is not in keeping with her current wishes.
   - SW following, appreciate their guidance
   - on conversation, patient states that her HCP is first her husband,
   followed by her daughter.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) and respiratory distress. The patient underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received external beam radiation therapy (XRT). She also had an endoscopy done, which revealed a small gastric ulcer that was injected with epinephrine. The patient's Hct levels have increased from 23.9 to 27.8 since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure due to shunt physiology caused by collapsed lung segments and compressive atelectasis. This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials. The patient required tracheostomy and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient had gastrointestinal bleeding around the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site, possibly due to stomach metastasis. An endoscopy was performed, and an ulcer was treated with intervention.
3. Right Internal Jugular (RIJ) and Superior Vena Cava (SVC) clot: A thrombus was found in the SVC, but the PICC line in the SVC continues to work. The patient is on continuous heparin and will start low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) today.

   collapsed lung of RUL and RML as well as compressive atelectasis in
   RLL.  This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with
   recruitment trials.  Now s/p tx for post-obstructive pneumonia with
   fever and GNR on sputum culture, growing pan-sensitive enterobacter.
   Pt now s/p trach and peg.   Patient back on ventilator overnight, after
   endoscopy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma, causing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient has undergone placement of a stent in her right main bronchus and has received XRT (radiation therapy) for four sessions.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient has a high A-a gradient, likely secondary to shunt physiology, perfusion of collapsed lung of right upper lobe (RUL) and right middle lobe (RML), as well as compressive atelectasis in the right lower lobe (RLL). This is likely a fixed defect and will not improve with recruitment trials.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleed, Upper (Melenia, GI Bleed, GIB): There are concerns about a bleed around the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site, especially in the setting of pain with low molecular weight heparin (Lovely) and possible stomach metastasis with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The patient has blood coming out of the PEG tube. An endoscopy with intervention for an ulcer was performed.
3. Right Internal Jugular (RIJ) and Superior Vena Cava (SVC) clot: A CT scan showed a thrombus in the SVC. A peripherally inserted"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The patient was admitted due to respiratory distress caused by superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and received a stent placement in the right main bronchus as well as external beam radiation therapy (XRT).

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, acute gastrointestinal bleed (melena), hypotension, and constipation. The respiratory failure was likely due to NSCLC and has been treated with tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. The gastrointestinal bleed was managed with endoscopy and placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient's sodium levels have decreased to 130, which may be related to poor oral intake associated with lung cancer.

The patient also has thrombi in the right internal jugular (RIJ) and superior vena cava (SVC), for which she is receiving low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox). Other issues include anxiety, social concerns, and pain control.

Overall, the patient's condition has improved with interventions such as tracheostomy, PEG tube placement, and radiation therapy. However, she still requires further management for her complications and ongoing treatment for her NSCLC."

   now s/p treatment for post-obstructive.  Pt now s/p trach and peg,
   using trache mask during the day and most of night.
   - Completed 8 day course of Ceftriaxone (to cover coag neg staph and
   enterobacter), ended [**11-24**]
   - Trach mask as tolerated
   - Have stopped steroids
   - Goal even fluid balance today
   - for anxiety, consider switch to klonipin as may cause less sedation
   than ativan
   Increased neck swelling:  concern for increased clot burden versus
   volume overload
   -consider restarting steroids since that had been stopped 1-2 days ago
   -check Factor Xa level to assess if lovenox therapeutic
   -CXR given increased edema
 NUTRITION: Vomiting yesterday with high residuals and again this
   morning without trigger (suctioning)
   - TFs turned down for now- allow pt to take PO if she wants

   - standing reglan, zofran prn, continue ativan
   Vomiting: as not associated with nausea, concern for intracranial
   versus vagal nerve problem.  Particularly as stopped steroids, ? if
   intracranial edema
   -consider head imaging and restarting steroids (decadron)

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB): S/p endoscopy

   lymphadenopathy.
   -plan as above
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Appreciate palliative care
   recs.  Now on methadone but patient complains of feeling tired and
   vomiting and thinks it is due to methodone.  Likely will not tolerate

   - consider change to fentanyl drip if LTAC will accept versus change to
   standing oxycodone if patient can tolerate
   # Anxiety: Now on prn Ativan
   -consider change as above
   #.  SOCIAL ISSUES:  Husband appears to be coping better than previous,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava syndrome and respiratory distress. She underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received XRT for treatment. The patient also had an acute respiratory failure, likely due to NSCLC, which was treated with tracheostomy and peg tube placement. She completed an 8-day course of ceftriaxone to cover coag-negative staph and enterobacter. The patient's symptoms include vomiting, neck swelling, pain, and anxiety. She is currently on Lovenox for anticoagulation, and her sodium levels are being monitored. The patient's cancer is in remission, but she has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and constipation. The patient's social issues involve coping with her condition and placement in a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may recur if her lung function continues to deteriorate or if there is further obstruction in the airways.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding due to an ulcer. There is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the bleeding, especially if the ulcer does not heal or if the patient experiences increased stress or trauma to the gastrointestinal tract.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a new diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) causing superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) and respiratory distress. She was transferred for further evaluation and treatment. The patient underwent placement of a stent in the right main bronchus and received XRT (radiation therapy) for four treatments since November 11th. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely due to NSCLC, and was treated with tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. She has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB), and has undergone endoscopy with intervention for ulcer and PEG tube placement with multiple biopsies. The patient also has thrombosis in the right internal jugular vein (RIJ) and superior vena cava (SVC), for which she is receiving low molecular weight heparin (Lovenox) for anticoagulation. Her sodium levels are being monitored closely due to hyponatremia, which has improved to 133. She has a new diagnosis of NSCLC and has received four treatments of XRT. Initial metastatic workup has been negative with negative abdominal and brain imaging but may have positive lymph nodes based on outpatient imaging. The patient is also experiencing constipation, anxiety, pain control, and social issues with her husband coping better. She"

s vomiting, neck swelling and pain still need to be managed
   further.  Goal 1-2 days until LTAC.
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of non-small cell lung carcinoma causing superior vena cava syndrome and respiratory distress. She has undergone tracheostomy and peg tube placement, and is currently using a trache mask during the day and most of the night. This indicates a risk of respiratory failure due to the underlying lung disease and potential complications from the interventions.

2. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC): The patient has SVC syndrome secondary to lung mass and bulky lymphadenopathy. There is concern for recent increased neck swelling due to increased clot burden or volume overload. Steroids have been restarted, and therapeutic levels of Lovenox have been ordered.

3. Nausea/Vomiting/Nutrition: The patient has experienced vomiting with high residuals and again this morning without trigger (suctioning). Tube feeds have been decreased, and standing reglan has been continued. There is concern that vomiting may be intracranial versus vagal nerve problem. Sucralfate and anxiolytics are also being used for symptom management.

4. Pain Control: The patient's pain is being managed with oxycodone 30-60mg po q4h plus 30-60mg po q2h prn for pain. Pain control recommendations from palliative care are being followed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ongoing issues include:
   # Respiratory Failure
   --continue TC as tolerates with ventilatory support as needed for
   comfort and at night
   # SVC syndrome-- concern for progression of clot burden/ tumor with
   limited treatment options. clot and tumor burden, no role for
   additional stenting
   - continue LMWH (indefinitely)
   - dexa with slow taper
   # Vomiting--unclear etiology, ? centrally mediated, ? med related,
   improved since yesterday
   Methadone d/c
   -continue standing reglan
   - zofran and ativan as needed
   -additional benefit possibly from dexa
   #  Pain Control-has chronic pain at baseline with high narcotic
   requirement
   -    pallaitive care input appreciated,
   -    continue oxycodone, klonopin for anxiety component
   # hyponatremia
labs most c/w with siadh
   -continue to follow na level,
   -monitor free water intake
   #NSCLC
   - not receiving chemotherapy at present, but will f/u with onc as outpt
   - s/p palliative XRT
   # Constipation
   -continue bowel regimen
   # R Pleural effusion- likely due to significant collapse, s/p
   thoracentesis
   -minimal re accumulation on repeat imaging and stable resp status
   # GI bleed
   - s/p epi injection of small gastric ulcer, now tolerating
   anticoagulation
   - hct  has been stable
