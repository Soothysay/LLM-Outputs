","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD, AAA, and HTN. He presented to his primary care physician with 4 days of dyspnea and was admitted to the hospital. The patient received treatment with solumedrol and nebs for 2 days, but then became tachypneic with an ABG showing pH 7.38/48/86 and a lactate level of 3.4, which prompted transfer to the MICU for a COPD exacerbation. The patient required BiPap overnight due to worsening tachypnea and has since been off it since 8 am. The patient's allergies include atenolol, Ms Contin (Oral) (Morphine Sulfate), and nausea/vomiting. The last dose of antibiotics was given, and the patient is currently receiving several ICU medications, including Atrovent nebs/Albuterol nebs, Methylprednisone 25mg q8, Azithromycin, SQ heparin, allopurinol, vit D, Atorvastatin, RISS, Nicotine TD, and Ambien.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD, AAA, and HTN. He presented to his primary care physician four days ago with dyspnea and was admitted to the hospital. He was treated with solumedrol and nebs for two days, but then became tachypneic with an ABG showing a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 48, and PaO2 of 86. This prompted a transfer to the MICU for a COPD exacerbation. The patient required BiPap overnight for worsening tachypnea but has been off it since 8 am. His allergies include atenolol, Ms Contin (Oral) (Morphine Sulfate), and nausea/vomiting. His last dose of antibiotics was azithromycin. The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications, including Atrovent nebs/Albuterol nebs, methylprednisolone, heparin, allopurinol, vitamin D, atorvastatin, RISS, nicotine TD, and ambien.

Physical examination findings include a well-nourished appearance without acute distress, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7 C (96.2 F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and hypertension who presented to the primary care physician (PCP) four days ago with dyspnea. He was admitted to the hospital and treated with solumedrol and nebs for two days before becoming tachypneic with an ABG of 7.38/48/86 and a lactate level of 3.4, prompting a transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for COPD exacerbation. The patient received BiPap overnight for worsening tachypnea and has been off it since 8 am. The patient's allergies include atenolol, Ms Contin (Oral) (Morphine Sulfate), and nausea/vomiting. He was on antibiotics, specifically azithromycin, as well as other medications such as Atrovent nebs/Albuterol nebs, methylprednisolone 25 mg every eight hours, heparin, allopurinol, vitamin D, atorvastatin, risse (likely referring to Risperidone), nicotine TD (transdermal), and Ambien. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except where noted above and below.

24-hour events:
- BiPap overnight for worsening tachypnea. Off since 8 am.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and long-term smoking. He presented with dyspnea for four days, consistent with a COPD exacerbation. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to worsening tachypnea and increased work of breathing. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. The patient has shown improvement in oxygenation but continues to be hypoxic. A CT angiogram was performed, ruling out pulmonary embolism but revealing mild pneumonia. The patient has been treated with nebulizers and intravenous steroids. His vital signs are relatively stable, although he has experienced some fluctuations in blood pressure. Fluid balance shows an overall negative balance. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and elevated glucose levels. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hyperlipidemia, gout, osteoporosis, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Proper lung hygiene and antibiotic therapy should be maintained.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a long smoking history. He presented with dyspnea for 4 days, which is consistent with a COPD exacerbation. He was transferred to the ICU due to acute worsening of tachypnea and increased work of breathing. Upon admission, the patient appeared wheezy, using accessory muscles, and had fair oxygen saturation. He continues to exhibit pursed lip breathing and mild respiratory distress. No evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray, and the patient does not appear to be fluid overloaded. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/62 mmHg to 105/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels. The patient is currently on various medications including steroids, antibiotics, bronchodilators, and antihypertensives. The plan includes monitoring the patient's condition, performing sputum culture, obtaining an abdominal ultrasound, and considering a CT angiography if initial tests are negative.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presents with respiratory distress and has been intubated due to hypoxia.
- A CT Angiography (CTA) was performed, revealing no acute pulmonary embolism (PE), but there is a focal patchy lesion in the left lower lobe (LLL), which raises concerns for pneumonia (PNA).
- The patient has a known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), but its evaluation is incomplete.
- Allergies include atenolol, wheezing, and nausea/vomiting to Ms Contin (Oral) (Morphine Sulfate).
- Infusions include fentanyl at 75 mcg/hour and midazolam (Versed) at 2 mg/hour.
- Other ICU medications and changes to medical and family history are not specified.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission.
- Flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The presence of a focal patchy lesion in the LLL suggests the possibility of pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially progress to a severe infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), presenting with respiratory distress and dyspnea for 4 days. He has been intubated due to hypoxia and unable to tolerate BiPap. The chest X-ray showed no acute pulmonary embolism (PE), but there is a focal patchy area in the left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 89-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74-96 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, albuterol, ipratropium, azithromycin, and solu-medrol. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, indicating an inflammatory response. The patient's condition has been worsening despite treatment, with increasing work of breathing and hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COPD exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of focal patchy area in the left lower lobe on the chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia. If left untreated, it can lead to further respiratory distress and potential sepsis.
2. Barotrauma: Positive pressure ventilation can cause barotrauma, which is lung injury due to overdistention"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a chief complaint of COPD and PNA (presumably pneumonia). The patient's condition has worsened, leading to intubation due to increased work of breathing and altered mental status. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, and is currently being treated with steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics for a suspected lower lobe infiltrate. Other medical conditions include hyperlipidemia, gout, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/53 mmHg to 105/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin T levels, with otherwise normal results. The patient's fluid balance is negative by 1,247 mL, and the patient has received a total of 1,310 mL of fluids since midnight. The patient is receiving IV fluids and medications including sedatives, pain medications, and antibiotics. The patient's condition is critical,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. He has been admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been since October 6th at 8:00 pm. His vital signs are within normal limits, but he is hypoxic with a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV), assist/autopilot mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 16, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 61 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 388, and respiratory exchange ratio (Ve) of 8.2 L/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal heart sounds and peripheral pulses. However, there are diminished breath sounds throughout the chest, indicating possible lung pathology. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present but distended. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient being intubated.

Laboratory results show elevated white"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of COPD and PNA. He presented with increased work of breathing and was unable to tolerate BiPAP, leading to intubation. The CT-PE was negative for PE but showed a possible LLL infiltrate. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: Vt 500 mL, RR 16, PEEP 8 cmH2O, FiO2 40%. His vital signs include Tmax 36.6 C, Tcurrent 36.3 C, HR 88 bpm, BP 92/59 mmHg, RR 16 insp/min, and SpO2 96%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct, and normal platelet count. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low magnesium level. The ABG shows a slightly elevated PaCO2 level. 

The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, with an acute exacerbation due to a new left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate. He is currently being treated with Solumedrol, albuterol nebs, ipra nebs, and antibiotics for the LLL infiltrate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and hypotension. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. The patient was initially on pressure support but was switched to mandatory minute ventilation (MMV) due to discomfort. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/60 to 140/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and sedation. His lab results show some abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, troponin T, and blood glucose levels. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and various interventions are being implemented, including respiratory support, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of altered mental status, development of sepsis or infection due to prolonged ICU stay and antibiotic use, and complications related to the patient's underlying COPD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of long-term smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with dyspnea for four days, consistent with a COPD exacerbation. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to worsening tachypnea and increased work of breathing. He has been maintained on nebulizers and solumedrol but has acutely worsened over the past 24 hours. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE) but showed mild pneumonia. The patient responded well to 20 mg IV lasix and is currently hemodynamically stable.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COPD exacerbation.
2. Mild pneumonia.
3. Potential risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Gout.
6. Osteoporosis.
7. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (no acute issue).
8. Chronic back pain.
9. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.
10. Stress ulcer due to prolonged bed rest and ICU stay.
11. Risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI).

Please note that this is a summary and potential medical complications based on the provided information. The patient's condition may vary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of COPD exacerbation and superimposed bilateral lower lobe pneumonia who is currently intubated for respiratory distress. The patient's condition has worsened while on the floor, possibly due to a new lower lobe infiltrate. He was intubated due to worsening mental status and inability to tolerate BiPAP. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly low blood pressure and low oxygen saturation. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,203 mL and output of 935 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,268 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications including steroids, albuterol nebs, ipratropium, vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium levels. Imaging shows bibasilar infiltrates on CT and hyperinflation on CXR. The patient's current assessment and plan include worsening COPD, lower lobe pneumonia, hyperlipidemia, and gout. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and restraints review. The patient's code status is full code"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of COPD exacerbation and superimposed bilateral lower lobe pneumonia. He was intubated due to worsening mental status and inability to tolerate BiPAP. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/63 to 140/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is critically ill and at risk for several potential medical complications. These may include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and bilateral lower lobe pneumonia put him at high risk for respiratory failure. Being intubated and on mechanical ventilation helps support his breathing but he still requires close monitoring and management.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and monitoring respiratory system infection parameters should be implemented to prevent this complication.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a long smoking history and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with dyspnea of 4 days duration consistent with a COPD exacerbation. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to tachypnea and increased work of breathing that acutely worsened over the past 24 hours. The patient has been maintained on nebulizers and solumedrol, but his condition has not improved. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), but showed mild pneumonia. The patient responded well to 20 mg IV lasix and is currently hemodynamically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating despite treatment, indicating a possible progression towards respiratory failure.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection associated with the use of ventilators.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the CTA was negative for PE, the patient's immobility and risk factors for thrombosis increase the likelihood of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to PE if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.

4. Nosocomial infection: P"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. Upon admission, the patient was intubated due to severe respiratory distress. However, the patient self-extubated the next morning, but subsequent arterial blood gas (ABG) results showed adequate oxygenation and ventilation without the need for bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). The patient was then placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 30%.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/66 to 156/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events.

Flow sheet data shows that the patient has received various medications, including antibiotics (levofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin), pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,458 mL total in, with outputs including 1,398 mL IV fluids, 72 mL PO, and 72 mL TF. The patient's blood products out were 2,080 mL with 680 mL being urine output. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.

Physical examination reveals a thin and anxious-appearing patient with decreased breath sounds throughout the chest. The patient's cardiovascular system shows normal S1 and distant S2 heart sounds. The peripheral vascular system is intact bilaterally. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show no edema, and the patient has clubbing on examination. The patient's neurologic examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count at 12.5 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) at 13.0 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level at 187 mg/dL, and slightly elevated lactate level at 3.2 mmol/L. Other lab values, including kidney function tests, electrolytes, and cardiac markers, are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, and hypotension. The patient's COPD exacerbation is ruled out. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

24-hour events include self-extubation and flu negative. The patient has allergies to Atenolol, wheezing, and nausea/vomiting with Ms Contin (Morphine Sulfate). The patient received antibiotics including Levofloxacin, Cefepime, and Vancomycin.

Infusions include Pantoprazole, Heparin Sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/72 to 156/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms. The flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of -622 mL and -484 mL, respectively. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through an aerosol-cool device, and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a spontaneous Vt of 894 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 7, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 30%, and PIP of 16 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results are within normal limits.

During physical examination, the patient appears thin, with clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. Neurologic assessment was not performed.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.0 g/dL, platelet count of 164 K/uL, blood glucose level of 187 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. Imaging shows bibasilar opacities stable on chest X-ray. Microbiology results indicate negative flu and other cultures pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with COPD exacerbation and superimposed bilateral LL PNA, now post intubation with self-extubation. The plan includes continuing steroid taper, Albuterol/Atrovent nebs standing and as needed, tapering antibiotics to Levofloxacin for PNA, following up with sputum culture sensitivities, checking ABG on 2 L NC, and then pulling a line. The patient also has hyperlipidemia and gout, with respective management plans.

ICU care includes nutrition as tolerated, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient has a code status of full code and will be dispositioned to the ICU with a call-out later in the afternoon if he does well. The total time spent with the patient is 25 minutes."
