   Assessment: This is an 83 year-old female with a history of back pain
   and fever in the setting on known hypertension, multiple psych issues.
   Plan:
   # Fever/leukocytosis:  Urine and Blood cultures positive.  Adequately
   covered at this time on current antibiotic regimen.  Still concerned
   over source of infection and the question of epidural abcess remains.
   Of note, the patient
s fever has diminished and  Leukocytosis has
   resolved.
   - ID consult for guidance re: antibiotics and possible additional
   imaging.
   - continue to follow-up blood and urine cultures pending
   # Altered mental status/Psych: Most likely secondary to infection as
   outlined above.   The patient was intubated due to mental status,
   however the patient is DNR/I.  Thus will extubate as soon as possible.
   - re-start home psych meds
   - limit sedating medications
   # Hypertension: Pt remains hypertensive despite being on beta-blocker
   and ace-inhibitor at this time.
   - consider restarting home regimen
   # Back pain: Unable to be assessed at this time.
   - consider MRI as above
   # Fungal infection: chronic candidal infection being treated as
   outpatient.
   - continue topical antifungals
   - anti-fungal cultures to assess for dissemination
   - consider adding fluconazole if persistent fever
   # Diabetes: On NPH and glipizide at home, will give half home dose [**Hospital1 **]
   and hold glipizide for now as pt NPO
   - ISS
   - [**1-10**] NPH meds
   # Hypothyroid: continue home dose
   # Skin rash: Chronic venous statis with ?contact dermatitis.
   - Wound care consult pending

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed the note of Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3238**] and
   agree with the findings and plan of care.  The exact etiology of the
   patient
s infection and bacteremia is not clear, with UTI and epidural
   abscess being considered.  Meningitis is less likely with benign LP
   results.  We will consult ID to assist us, and once MRI is completed we
   will make concerted effort to extubate her as her wishes had been
   DNI/DNR.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of back pain and fever. She has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and impaired skin integrity. She has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, multiple psych issues, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and a chronic candidal infection. The patient's fever has diminished and leukocytosis has resolved. She is intubated but DNR/I, so extubation will be done as soon as possible. She is currently receiving various medications and treatments for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has a history of acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or other complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's fever and leukocytosis have improved, she still has positive blood cultures indicating ongoing infection. There is a risk of progression to septic shock or development of new infections.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to chronic venous stasis with contact dermatitis. This increases the risk of wound infections or cellulitis.
4. Back pain and potential epidural abscess: The patient's back pain and fever raise concern for an epidural abscess, which can be a serious condition requiring urgent intervention.

   Physical Examination
   Assesment: This is an 83 year-old female with a history of back pain
   and fever in the setting on known hypertension, multiple psych issues.
   Plan:
   # Fever/leukocytosis:  There is no clear cause for infection at this
   point but given the patient's significant mental status changes and
   agitation, am concerned for a CNS source.  Given history of back pain,
   will first evaluate the patient for a paraspinal/epidural abscess with
   an MRI.  Then will get LP to evaluate for meningitis.  However, given
   rapid onset and potential morbidity in this patient for a CNS
   infection, will treat with Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir and
   ampicillin empirically now.  Other potential sources of infection
   include lower extremity open wounds and less likely endocarditis
   (murmur on exam).  No signs of pulmonary source at this time.  Though
   less likely neuroleptic malignant syndrome is also possible.
   - Empiric IV antibiotics
   - MRI Head, C/T/L spine
   - LP
   - blood and urine cultures pending
   - hold Mellaril
   # Altered mental status: Most likely secondary to infection as outline
   above, regardless of infection source, likely has delirium.  Was
   intubated due to mental status, however the patient is DNR/I.  Thus
   will extubate as soon as possible.  No clear metabolic source of
   altered mental status as hypercalcemia is mild, tox screen negative.
   - treat infection
   - limit sedating medications
   # Hypertension: Patient has poorly controlled hypertension at
   baseline.  It is unclear if patient is compliant as she is on a
   multi-drug regimen without control.  Otherwise would should  be
   evaluated for secondary causes for hypertension.
   Will start on beta-blocker and short acting ace-inhibitor at this time.
   - metoprolol, captopril
   - add rest of home meds as needed
   # Back pain: though this cannot be confirmed, the patient gave a
   history of back pain to EMS.  As above concern for paraspinal abscess
   will be evaluated with MRI.  Additionally, will repeat ECG, echo. No
   signs of aortic dissection confirmed with the radiologist.  Pancreatic
   enzymes negative as well as LFTs.  Is at high risk for MI and would
   - evaluate for infection as above.
   - no additional history per hcp, will readdress when patient alert.
   - repeat ECG
   - ROMI
   # Fungal infection: has candidal infection on skin appearance and is
   being treated topically (though HCP remarks that she thinks the patient
   has been on diflucan).
   - topical antifungals
   - anti-fungal cultures
   - consider adding fluconazole if persistent fever
   # Diabetes: On NPH and glipizide at home, will give half home dose [**Hospital1 **]
   and hold glipizide for now.

   - [**1-10**] NPH meds
   # Hypothyroid: continue home dose

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of back pain, fever, known hypertension, multiple psychiatric issues, and recent intubation and sedation. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, fever, and back pain. The note indicates concern for a central nervous system (CNS) source of infection, such as meningitis or epidural abscess, due to the patient's rapid onset of symptoms and significant mental status changes. An MRI was ordered to evaluate for paraspinal/epidural abscess, and a lumbar puncture (LP) was performed to evaluate for meningitis. Empiric IV antibiotics were started, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and ampicillin, given the potential morbidity associated with CNS infections. Other potential sources of infection include lower extremity open wounds and less likely endocarditis. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome was also considered but less likely.

The patient's vital signs show a high fever, hypertension, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient has received multiple infusions of medications, including propofol, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. The flowsheet data indicates fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, respiratory support, and medication administration.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for worsening sepsis, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and possibly a fungal infection based on the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of back pain, fever, hypertension, and multiple psychiatric issues. She was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and intubated. The patient has been experiencing fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive urine and blood cultures. She also has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). Additionally, the blood cultures show gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, suggesting a potential bloodstream infection.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection, and she is at risk for developing delirium.
3. Hypertension: The patient has poorly controlled hypertension, which may be exacerbated by her current condition.
4. Back pain: The patient's back pain could potentially be due to a paraspinal abscess or another underlying condition that needs further evaluation.
5. Fungal infection: The patient has a candidal skin infection, which should be treated appropriately.
6. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes management should be closely monitored, considering her current condition.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism should be managed accordingly.
8. Skin rash: The patient's chronic venous stasis with possible contact dermatitis requires wound care and consultation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of back pain and fever. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on invasive ventilation. She has known hypertension and multiple psychiatric issues. The patient's fever has diminished, and leukocytosis has resolved since starting antibiotics. However, there is still concern about the source of infection and the possibility of an epidural abscess. The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection. She is DNR/I, so extubation will be done as soon as possible. The patient remains hypertensive despite medication and cannot be assessed for back pain due to altered mental status. She has a chronic candidal infection being treated as an outpatient. Her diabetes is managed with NPH and glipizide, but the glipizide is currently held due to the patient being NPO. She also has hypothyroidism and a chronic venous stasis with contact dermatitis. Wound care consult is pending. The patient's nutritional status is NPO, and she is on prophylaxis for DVT and VAP. Her code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has chronic venous stasis with possible contact dermatitis. Proper wound care is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is on invasive ventilation due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is an 83 year-old female with a history of back pain
   and fever in the setting on known hypertension, multiple psych issues.
   Plan:
   # Fever/leukocytosis/Bacteremia:  Urine and Blood cultures positive.
   Adequately covered at this time on current antibiotic regimen.  Still
   concerned over source of infection and the question of epidural abcess
   remains.  Murmur on exam concerning for endocarditis, but no peripheral
   manifestations of endocarditis. Of note, the patient

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of back pain and fever. She has known hypertension and multiple psychiatric issues. She presented with altered mental status, which led to intubation. The patient's fever has diminished, and leukocytosis has resolved. She is currently being treated for group B strep bacteremia, possibly from a skin or oral source. An echocardiogram will be obtained to evaluate for endocarditis. Preliminary MRI results suggest no epidural abscess. The patient is set to be extubated today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient initially presented with fever and leukocytosis, indicating a potential infection. She is being treated for group B strep bacteremia, and further evaluation is needed to determine the source of the infection.
2. Endocarditis: A murmur was noted during the physical examination, which raises concern for endocarditis. An echocardiogram will help evaluate this possibility.
3. Epidural abscess: Although preliminary MRI results suggest no epidural abscess, the question remains due to the patient's back pain and fever. A follow-up MRI report is pending.
4. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes management is complicated by her being NPO (nothing by mouth) in the hospital. She is receiving half her usual home dose of NPH insulin and will hold glipizide for now.
5. Hypertension: The patient remains hypertensive"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of low back pain. The patient has undergone an MRI of the spine, which did not show any obvious epidural abscess or vertebral abnormalities. An ID consult was obtained, suggesting the possibility of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as the cause of the patient's symptoms. The ID advised stopping antibiotics (vancomycin, ampicillin) and continuing treatment for GBS with corticosteroids (CTX) and Flagyl for aspiration. A TTE was ordered to evaluate for subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), and daily cultures were recommended. The possibility of cardiac etiology for the back pain was also considered if the MRI was negative.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), blood pressure ranging from 131/55 to 173/96 mmHg, heart rate between 75 and 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is receiving propofol infusion and has been on heparin sodium for prophylaxis since December 22nd.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, glucose levels, and creatinine. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's blood cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on December 21st and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of back pain, fever, hypertension, multiple psychiatric issues, altered mental status, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and a chronic fungal infection. She was admitted to the ICU with low back pain and fever. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and treatments for her conditions. Her fever has diminished, and leukocytosis has resolved. She is currently intubated due to altered mental status but is DNR/I. The plan is to extubate her as soon as possible. She remains hypertensive despite medication and has an undiagnosed back pain. She also has a chronic candidal infection being treated as an outpatient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient initially presented with fever and leukocytosis, suggesting a possible infection. Although her fever has improved and leukocytosis has resolved, there is still concern about the source of infection, especially considering the positive urine and blood cultures. There is a possibility of ongoing bacteremia or a new infection.
2. Epidural abscess: Despite the negative initial MRI, there is still concern for an epidural abscess causing the patient's back pain. Further evaluation and follow-up imaging may be necessary to rule out this complication.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status changes could be secondary to the infection. If the infection is not adequately controlled, there is a risk of continued or worsening altered mental status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of back pain, fever, hypertension, multiple psych issues, and previous diagnoses of diabetes, hypothyroidism, and fungal infection. 

The patient was admitted with low back pain and fever. She had an MRI of the spine performed, which showed no obvious epidural abscess or vertebral abnormalities. An infectious disease consult was obtained, considering the possibility of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) as the cause of her symptoms. The ID consultant advised stopping acyclovir, vancomycin, and ampicillin, while continuing ceftriaxone and Flagyl. A TTE was recommended to evaluate for subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), and daily CXR was suggested to rule out a cardiac etiology of her back pain.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/55 mmHg to 97/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal ventilation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of back pain and fever, known hypertension, who was admitted for further evaluation. The patient presented with impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. She was initially intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated without complication. A nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed due to severe observed aspiration, and a computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed adequate placement. The patient was started on Flagyl in case of aspiration pneumonia, given her poor dentition and aspiration noted. Her home antihypertensives were restarted, with evening blood pressures in the 130's systolic. An MRI of the spine was performed and returned without evidence of paraspinal abscess or osteomyelitis. The patient's medical and family history remained unchanged. Review of systems showed no changes from admission except as noted below.

Over the past 24 hours, the following additional events occurred:
1. The patient was extubated without complication.
2. NGT tube placement due to severe observed aspiration; CXR confirmed adequate placement.
3. The patient was started on Flagyl in case of aspiration pneumonia, with concern for poor dentition and aspiration noted.
4. The patient's home antihypertensives were re-started, with evening blood pressures in the 130's systolic.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints include fever, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and bacteremia. The patient was extubated yesterday and had difficulty swallowing clear liquids, leading to the placement of an NG tube. An MRI of the spine was negative for a paraspinal abscess.

The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat gram-positive bacteria in the blood and gram-negative bacteria in the urine. Oxygenation has been acceptable post-extubation, but the patient has a congested cough. Repeat CXR is planned, and the patient will receive tube feeds due to problems with swallowing, which may improve as the mental status improves. An echo is scheduled today to assess for valve vegetations.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/43-185/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has trace edema in the right extremity and no cyanosis or clubbing.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, platelet count of 206 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and glucose level of 115 mg/dL. Other lab results include an"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: This is an 83 year-old female with a history of back pain
   and fever in the setting on known hypertension, now s/p extubation
   [**2120-11-22**].
   Plan:
   # Fever/leukocytosis/Bacteremia:   [**1-12**] Blood Cultures demonstrating pan
   sensitive GBS. Surveillance cxs negative.  No evidence of epidural
   abcess, ostemyelitis or discitis on MRI.  Murmur on exam concerning for
   endocarditis, but no peripheral manifestations of endocarditis. Of
   note, the patient's fever has diminished and  leukocytosis has
   resolved. Given LP WNL, d/cd Vancomycin, Acylovir and Ampicillin on
   Friday. Urine growing out Gram negative rods, but under 1000 and UA
   clear. Therefore, low suspicion for true gram negative for UTI.
   - Continue   CeftriaXONE 2 g IV Q24H  and MetRONIDAZOLE (FLagyl) 500
   mg IV Q8H  for CAP and Aspiration
   - Plan to hold on TTE given lack of persistent fevers. In addition,
   murmur is known and GBS not tyical for endocarditis.
   - f/u ID reccs
   - QD surveillance blood cultures per ID
   -con't f/u cultures
   -QD CXR's
   # Altered mental status/Psych: Most likely secondary to infection as
   outlined above.   Improving, but aspiration is likely in part secondary
   to inability to attend to basic operations of swollowing. Home psych
   medications have been restarted.
   -con't to monitor
   -con't psych meds, Thioridazine HCl 10 mg PO BID
   #Observed Aspiration: aspiration is likely in part secondary to
   inability to attend to basic operations of swollowing. Failed S and S
   evaluation [**12-23**] [**2-10**] to poor mental status
   -Con't NG tubes with PO medications through NG tube
   -will eventually need repeat speech and swallow as mental status
   improves.
   # Hypertension: Patient remains hypertensive on enalapril 20 po bid,
   hctz 25 po daily, metoprolol 50 tid and valsartan 160 mg po tid. Max
   dose analapril, valsartan. Can increase hctz to 50 daily or metoprolol
   to 200 daily. Given psychiatric issues, a fair component of this HTN
   may be anxiety.
   - Continue enalapril, hctz, valsartan, metoprolol
   - Add clonidine patch for better BP control.
   # Back pain: MRI negative.
   - reassess back pain as mental status improves.
   # Fungal infection: chronic candidal infection being treated as
   outpatient.
   - continue topical antifungals
   - anti-fungal cultures to assess for dissemination
   - consider adding fluconazole if persistent fever
   # Diabetes: On NPH and glipizide at home, has been getting half home
   dose [**Hospital1 **] as pt. has been NPO. Given that we are starting tube feeds
   this AM, should restart 100% NPH, con't ISS.
   - ISS
   - Increase NPH from [**1-10**] to 100%
   # Hypothyroid: continue home dose  Levothyroxine
   # Skin rash: Chronic venous statis with ?contact dermatitis.
   - Wound care following
   #Hyperlipidemia: Continue home Atorvastatin 40 mg PO DAILY
   #Proph: Cont Lansoprazole Oral Disintegrating Tab 30 mg PO DAILY,
   Heparin SQ.
   #FEN: Tube Feeds to start today. QD lytes with PRN repletion.
   # Disposition: Plan to call out to floor today

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of back pain and fever, known hypertension, and recent extubation. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including fever/leukocytosis/bacteremia, altered mental status/psych, observed aspiration, hypertension, back pain, fungal infection, diabetes, hypothyroidism, skin rash, hyperlipidemia, prophylaxis, and feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/leukocytosis/bacteremia: The patient initially had bacteremia with pan-sensitive group B streptococcus (GBS), but now her fever has diminished and leukocytosis has resolved. However, she still requires continued IV antibiotics for CAP and aspiration pneumonia.
2. Altered mental status/psych: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection. Psychiatric medications have been restarted, and she will continue to be monitored for mental status changes.
3. Observed aspiration: The patient is at risk of aspiration due to her inability to attend to basic swallowing operations. She is currently on NG tube feeds, and once her mental status improves, she will need a repeat speech and swallow evaluation.
4. Hypertension: The patient remains hypertensive despite multiple antihypertensive medications. Her blood pressure may be influenced by anxiety, and further optimization of her medication regimen is needed.
5. Back pain: The patient's back pain has been evaluated, but no significant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with fevers, hypertension, and impaired skin integrity. She has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and cardiovascular drugs. Her vital signs are unstable with high blood pressure and abnormal lab results indicating renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated white blood cell count. She is on respiratory support and has a history of sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis progression: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient's fevers persist, indicating a potential ongoing infection that could lead to sepsis worsening.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on respiratory support and her ABG results show respiratory acidosis. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
3. Kidney injury: The elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to acute kidney injury.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite medication adjustments. This indicates a potential risk for cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The presence of impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers or infections.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is a concern, and inadequate nutrition can impair wound healing and immune function, increasing the risk of complications.
7. Medication-related complications: With multiple medications being administered, there is a possibility of drug interactions, adverse effects, or medication errors that could impact the patient's recovery.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and assessment are necessary to confirm these findings and guide appropriate management."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of back pain, fever, known hypertension, and chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and a skin rash. She presented with fevers and was found to have leukocytosis and bacteremia due to gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. An epidural abscess was ruled out on preliminary reads of the MRI total spine. The patient's fever has diminished, and leukocytosis has resolved. She was given vancomycin, acyclovir, and ampicillin but was later discontinued from these medications. Her urine is growing gram-negative rods, but there is low suspicion for a true gram-negative urinary tract infection. She continues to receive ceftriaxone and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient initially presented with fevers and bacteremia, indicating a possible infection. She was treated with antibiotics, but there is a concern for a urinary tract infection due to the presence of gram-negative rods in her urine. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed will be important.
2. Aspiration: The patient has altered mental status, likely secondary to infection, which increases the risk of aspiration. She may require continued nasogastric (NG) tube placement and close monitoring for signs of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is being treated with various"

   abcess, ostemyelitis or discitis on MRI.  Murmur on exam concerning for
   endocarditis, but no peripheral manifestations of endocarditis. Of
   note, the patient's fever has diminished and  leukocytosis has
   resolved. Given LP WNL, d/cd Vancomycin, Acylovir and Ampicillin on
   Friday. Urine growing out Gram negative rods, but under 1000 and UA
   clear. Therefore, low suspicion for true gram negative for UTI.
