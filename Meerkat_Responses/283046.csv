","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic sacral wound, and sepsis. He now presents with NSTEMI. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has a large burn wound that is well-healed, soft, non-tender, and without signs of infection. However, he also has a large sacral/posterior thigh decubitus ulcer with purulent drainage. The patient has undergone multiple procedures and interventions, including an ultrasound, arterial line placement, and central venous catheter insertion. He is currently on various medications including antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Daptomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam), sedatives (Midazolam), pain management (Fentanyl), and anticoagulants (Heparin). The patient's vital signs are stable, but his laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactate, and troponin levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of chronic wound infection and current purulent drainage from a decubitus ulcer. This increases the risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for possible pneumonia, given the yellow sputum production. 
3. NSTEMI: The patient has evidence of myocardial ischemia, as"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic sacral wound, and sepsis who is now experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of chronic sacral wound and is now presenting with sepsis. There is concern about the possibility of a lung source or wound source for the infection. The patient's blood cultures have been sent, and antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing a combination of hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure due to the inability to adequately ventilate and oxygenate. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, and peak inspiratory pressure at 21 cmH2O.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may be related to the current infection and use of levophed. The patient's heart rhythm has recently returned to sinus rhythm, but further monitoring and evaluation are required.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine levels are elevated at 1.5 mg/dL"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, seizure disorder, depression, squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil and oropharynx, aspiration pneumonia with tracheostomy, extensive truncal and lower extremity burn wounds post skin grafting, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). 

The patient presents from a nursing home with hypoxemia and has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to pneumonia in the left lung. He also has leukocytosis and tachycardia. The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with likely hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure. His atrial fibrillation is likely related to infection and the use of phenylephrine. He has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.5, which is likely due to sepsis/hypotension. 

The patient's medical history includes seizure disorder and depression, and he is currently taking Depakote for his seizure disorder. He has chronic pain and is on methadone and percocet, but these medications are being held while on fentanyl. He also has hypothyroidism and is being treated with IV levothyroxine while intubated. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's current conditions and medical history put him at risk for several complications. These may include worsening sepsis and pneumonia, further respiratory failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. He has been diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute renal failure (ARF), impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), tachycardia, acute respiratory failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/53 to 145/65 mmHg, respiratory rate between 20-37 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 100%, and temperature within normal limits. Fluid balance shows an intake of 7,034 mL and output of 2,095 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,939 mL. The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and troponin T, while white blood cell count is within normal range. The patient's condition remains unchanged since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's diagnosis of AMI and AFIB, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal"

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, seizure disorder, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, aspiration pneumonia requiring tracheostomy, and severe burn injury. The patient presented with hypoxemia and subsequently became hypotensive, requiring pressors, and somnolent, requiring intubation.

The patient was ruled in for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and started on heparin. Blood cultures were obtained from the central venous line (CVL) and sputum culture. An ultrasound and arterial line were also initiated.

The patient is on multiple medications including daptomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), ciprofloxacin, phenylephrine, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and heparin sodium. Other medications include colace, neurontin, ASA, protonix, levothyrox, and linezolid.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 109/52 mmHg, respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) 57, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) 15"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.Septic shock
 pressor requirement decreased.  U/O remains robust.
   Plan to wean neo.   Source possibly sacral decub vs. pulmonary,
   although CXR relatively unimpressive, although retrocardiac opacity had
   blossomed.
   -Complete linezolid/cefepime x 8days, plan for plastics eval at [**Hospital1 **] or
   [**Hospital1 49**]
   -Maintain CVP >8 if continues to have vasopressor requirement, but
   transitioning toward extubation.
   2. Resp failure
  component of hypoxemia [**2-14**] above infitrates, but no
   comfortable on PS .4, [**5-17**].  Secretions minimal, suctioning q4h.  If
   patient can follow commands adequately, and vasopressors dc
d, will
   consider extubation.
   -turn off versed, [**Month (only) 202**] fentanyl
   -SBT, possible extubation
   3. NSTEMI- demand, most likely, vs small thrombotic event.
   -check TTE
   -cont heparin x48h, pending TTE.
   3. ARF- improved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old individual with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, seizure disorder, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, aspiration pneumonia requiring tracheostomy, and severe burn injury. The patient presented with hypoxemia and subsequently became hypotensive (requiring pressors) and somnolent (requiring intubation).

The patient was ruled in for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and started on heparin. Blood cultures were taken from the central venous line (CVL) and sputum culture was also collected. An ultrasound was performed, and arterial line was started. Blood cultures were repeated from the arterial line. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was obtained.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including daptomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), ciprofloxacin, phenylephrine, midazolam (Versed), fentanyl (Concentrate), and heparin sodium. Other medications include colace, neurontin, ASA, protonix, levothyroxine, and linezolid.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
- Heart rate: 65 bpm

   # Sepsis:  CXR not impressive, lung mechanics good, oxygenating well,
   small amount of yellow sputum. Could be lung source but would be
   concerned about wound source given purulent drainage. No resistant GNRs
   on culture so will stop cipro. Flu negative d/c
d tamilflu. UOP has
   been very good so will tolerate lower CVPs as will be trying to
   extubate.
   - Plastics consult when off pressors and vent
   - Linezolid, cefepime
   - d/c cipro
   - send sputum GS/Cultures
   - boluses as needed goal UOP>50 cc/hr.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u urine cultures
   - f/u sputum cultures
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  ? PNA. Tolerating PS 5/5 well. RSBI 40
   - d/c midazolam and plan for extubation this afternoon
   .
   # NSTEMI: Likely demand in the setting of sepsis and demand ischemia.
   Will check echo for WMA.
   - Continue medical management as not cath candidate
   - ASA, heparin, atorvastatin

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic sacral wound, and sepsis who now presents with NSTEMI. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including an inability to wean from the ventilator, weakness, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that progressed to atrial fibrillation (AF), inability to wean phenylephrine, and wound draining purulent fluid. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 140 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/72 mmHg to 124/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab values indicate elevated troponin-T levels, lactic acid within normal range, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's assessment and plan include suspected sepsis with a potential lung or wound source, ongoing treatment for respiratory failure, management of NSTEMI without the need for cardiac catheterization, resolution of acute renal failure, seizure disorder, chronic pain,"

   ICU Care
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic sacral wound, and sepsis now presenting with NSTEMI. The patient is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has not been able to wean off the ventilator. He also has a large healed burn wound and below-knee amputation.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced several significant events. At 06:19 AM, an EKG was performed, and at 02:00 AM, cefepime was administered. The patient was unable to wean from the vent, and weakness was noted. An attempted spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) resulted in the patient going into supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) around 200 beats per minute, which then broke into atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient was also unable to wean phenylephrine. Additionally, the patient's wound is draining purulent fluid.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), a heart rate of 140 beats per minute with irregularly irregular rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 114/72 mmHg to 87/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg. Fluid balance"

   Impression:
   1.Septic shock
 pressor requirement decreased but remains.  U/O
   remains robust.  We continue to try to wean neo.  [**Month (only) 11**] remain with small
   requirement due to preload reduction via PPV and component of
   sedation/analgesia (although doesn
t completely resolve in that
   setting).  Source remains most likely sacral decub, less c/w pulmonary.
   CXR relatively unimpressive, although retrocardiac opacity.
   -Complete linezolid/cefepime x 8days.
   -Plan for plastics eval at [**Hospital1 **] or [**Hospital1 49**]
   -Re-check CVP to insure that volume status has not vasopressor
   requirement.
   2. Resp failure
  minimal component of hypoxemia [**2-14**] above infitrates,
   but not comfortable on PS .4, [**5-17**].  Secretions minimal, suctioning
   q4h.  If patient can follow commands adequately, will consider
   extubation.
   -turn off versed/ fentanyl
   -SBT x at lease one hour given h/o oropharyngeal ca and prior trach.
   3. NSTEMI- demand, most likely, vs small thrombotic event.
   -await TTE
   3. ARF- improved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, seizure disorder, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), aspiration pneumonia requiring tracheostomy, and severe burn injury associated with sepsis. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Septic shock: The patient is still requiring vasopressor support and has a robust urine output. Efforts are being made to wean off the ventilator, but the patient still has small requirements due to preload reduction via positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and sedation/analgesia.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has minimal components of hypoxemia due to infiltrates, but is not comfortable on pressure support (PS) level 4. Secretions are minimal, and suctioning is performed every 4 hours. If the patient can follow commands adequately, extubation may be considered. The plan includes turning off versed/fentanyl and performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for at least one hour given the patient's history of oropharyngeal cancer and prior tracheostomy.

3. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): This is most likely a demand ischemia versus a small thrombotic event. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is awaited.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function"

   -Maintain CVP >8 if continues to have vasopressor requirement, but
   transitioning toward extubation.
   2. Resp failure
  component of hypoxemia [**2-14**] above infitrates, but no
   comfortable on PS .4, [**5-17**].  Secretions minimal, suctioning q4h.  If
   patient can follow commands adequately, will consider extubation.
   -turn off versed/ fentanyl

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, seizure disorder, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and a severe burn injury. The patient presented with hypoxemia and subsequently became hypotensive, requiring pressors, and somnolent, requiring intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory support. There are concerns about infitrates and secretions, suggesting a possible respiratory failure component due to the infitrates seen on imaging.

2. Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating a possible myocardial infarction, most likely non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient has decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels, indicating possible acute renal failure.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a history of severe burn injury, which increases the risk of impaired skin integrity and potential wound infections.

5. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, and there is no mention of any rhythm control measures being taken.

6. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated (140 bpm), indicating tachycardia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. These include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is currently on vasopressors, indicating a decreased requirement, but still requires close monitoring.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemia due to infiltrates seen on imaging, but is comfortable on a low level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Secretions are minimal, and there are plans for extubation if the patient can follow commands and vasopressors are discontinued.
3. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient likely had a small thrombotic event. Further assessment with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned, and heparin therapy will be continued for 48 hours pending the TTE results.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has improved.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has pressure ulcers.
6. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing this arrhythmia.
7. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate.
8. Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS): The patient has respiratory distress but does not meet criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
9. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient was previously diagnosed with sepsis.

The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care,"

   Although Mr. [**Known lastname 9498**] did well on [**5-17**], the combination of residual
   vasopressor requirement, minimal cuff leak, oropharyngeal cancer, and
   secretions suggests we should wait another day and reassess for

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, seizure disorder, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, aspiration pneumonia requiring tracheostomy, and severe burn injury associated with sepsis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and septic shock.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 140 beats per minute, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode. The ventilator settings include tidal volume of 621 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 298.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low calcium and magnesium levels.

Impressions:

1. Septic shock: The patient's sepsis is suspected to be the cause of his current condition. Despite decreased vasopressor requirements, he still requires some support. His urine output"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, right ventricular failure, chronic sacral wound, and sepsis with NSTEMI. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for several conditions.

1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient still has significant greenish secretions in the lungs, possibly indicating a pulmonary source of infection. The plan is to continue with linezolid and cefepime for 7 days, send sputum GS/Cultures, bolus fluids as needed to achieve a urine output goal of >50 cc/hr and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, wean neo (likely referring to vasopressor medication neosynephrine), follow up blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is tolerating pressure support (PS) well but is not responding well to commands. It is planned to continue off sedation and attempt extubation this afternoon if the patient follows commands.

3. NSTEMI: The patient likely has a myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of sepsis and demand ischemia as no wall motion abnormality (WMA) was observed on the echocardiogram. The plan is to continue medical management as the patient is not a candidate for catheterization, administer aspirin (ASA)"

   Impression:
   61-year-old man with complex prior history now with sepsis and
   respiratory failure.
   1.Septic shock
 pressor requirement decreased but remains.  U/O
   remains robust.  We continue to try to wean neo.  [**Month (only) 11**] remain with small
   requirement due to preload reduction via PPV and component of
   sedation/analgesia (although doesn
t completely resolve in that
   setting).  Source remains most likely sacral decub, less c/w pulmonary.
   CXR relatively unimpressive, although retrocardiac opacity.
   -Complete linezolid/cefepime x 8days, depdning on cultures and further
   evaluation of decub.
   -Anticipate need for more definitive management of decub (plastics eval
   at [**Hospital1 **] or [**Hospital1 49**])
   -Re-check CVP to insure that volume status has not vasopressor
   requirement.
   - check cortisol
   2. Resp failure
  minimal component of hypoxemia [**2-14**] above infitrates,
   but not comfortable on PS .4, [**5-17**].  Secretions minimal, suctioning
   q4h.  If patient can follow commands adequately, will consider
   extubation.
   -turn off versed/ fentanyl
   -SBT x at lease one hour given h/o oropharyngeal ca and prior trach.
   3. NSTEMI- demand, most likely, vs small thrombotic event.
   -await TTE
   3. ARF- improved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of septic shock. They have been admitted to the ICU and received multiple doses of antibiotics including daptomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and cefepime. The patient is currently receiving phenylephrine, midazolam (Versed), and fentanyl infusions. Other medications include metoprolol, diltiazem, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and various ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/47 mmHg to 85/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 36.4 C. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 528 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 28. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.29, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 46 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 353. The patient's white blood cell count is 291 K/uL, blood glucose level is 63 mg/dL, and creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's conditions include septic shock, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute renal failure (ARF), impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), tachycardia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is being managed in the ICU with appropriate nutrition, glycemic control, multi-lumen lines, arterial line, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock leading to organ dysfunction or failure, progression of acute myocardial infarction, development of new cardiac arrhythmias, further deterioration of renal function, pressure ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and potential respiratory complications related to mechanical ventilation."

   Patient with acute respiratory failure and hypotension from presumed

   CVP has been [**4-20**]. When given fluid, he tends to have high urine output
   and sustains constant CVP.  Cortisol level okay. Secretions have
   improved, but remain moderate in amount.
   On exam: patient is intubated and comfortable. Chest reveals few

   with active bowel sounds. No tenderness or guarding. Bilateral BKA.
   Would give fluids to maintain urine output > 50 cc/hr. Phenylephrine
   now off. If it needs to be restarted, would add vasopressin. Give
   additional 16 hours of bronchopulmonary hygiene; consider extubation in

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of oropharyngeal cancer, severe burn injury, and bilateral below-knee amputation. He is currently in the ICU due to septic shock, respiratory failure, and suspected myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has been critically ill but has shown some improvement. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PSV mode. His blood pressure is supported with phenylephrine. The patient's secretions have improved, and his cortisol level is low normal. He has a trace aortic regurgitation on echocardiogram. His WBC count has normalized, and he has defervesced. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is still requiring vasopressor support, indicating ongoing hypotension. There is a concern for ongoing preload reduction and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There may be a need for extubation if the patient's secretions improve and he can follow commands adequately.
3. Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient is suspected to have an NSTEMI, although it cannot be completely ruled out. Further evaluation and management are needed.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function needs ongoing monitoring, and the need for dialysis should be considered if there is worsening"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and right ventricular failure, chronic sacral wound, and sepsis with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been sedated, but was able to follow commands intermittently. The patient has been weaned off propofol and sedation, but still has limited ability to respond to commands. The patient's mental status improved at 11 pm, but with copious yellow secretions and in atrial fibrillation/rhythm control. Propofol was started, and the patient's heart rate was controlled with metoprolol. The patient was converted to sinus rhythm within an hour. The patient was also weaned off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient still has significant greenish secretions, possibly indicating a pulmonary source. The patient is still on a small amount of neosynephrine and needs to maintain urine output and mean arterial pressure (MAP) goals. The patient is being treated with antibiotics (linezolid and cefepime) and cultures are being sent. The patient's condition will be closely monitored, and further management will depend on the results of the cultures and the patient's response to treatment.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient may have pneumonia (PNA) as indicated by the presence of secretions. The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and RVR, chronic sacral wound, NSTEMI, and resolving sepsis. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Sepsis/Hypotension: Resolved, with improvement in CXR suggesting that the lung is not the source of infection. The elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and purulent drainage from the sacral wound suggest a possible biliary source or decubitus ulcer. Linezolid and cefepime will be continued for 7 days unless imaging shows osteomyelitis. Blood cultures will be followed up, and surgery consultation is required for the management of the sacral decubitus. An MRI of the sacrum and RUQ ultrasound are also considered.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been extubated and is oxygenating well. ABG recheck and discontinuation of Aline if not hypercarbic are planned.

3. NSTEMI: Likely demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis and demand. Medical management will continue as the patient is not a candidate for catheterization. ASA and atorvastatin will be continued. Weaning of neosynephrine should be done as soon as possible, and heparin has been stopped.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Resolved, with planned urine ly"

   BKA and severe sacral decubitus ulcer a/w sepsis and respiratory
   failure.
   1.Septic shock
 now off vasopressors, stable.  Uo remains robust.
   Source remains most likely sacral decub, less c/w pulmonary. CXR w/
   retrocardiac opacity rapidly resolved. Nl [**Last Name (un) **] stim.
   -Complete linezolid/cefepime x 8days, complete [**12-13**], depending on
   cultures and further evaluation of decub.
   -Anticipate need for more definitive management of decub (plastics eval
   at [**Hospital1 **] or [**Hospital1 49**])
   2. Resp failure
  hypoxemic.  Plan to extubate today.  Secretions
   continue to improve, suctioning q4h.  If patient can follow commands
   adequately, will consider extubation.   h/o trach and prior
   oropharyngeal ca requires judicious assessment.
   -turn off versed/ fentanyl
   -SBT x at lease one hour given h/o oropharyngeal ca and prior trach.
   -On [**5-17**] had metabolic and resp acidosis (slight).  Plan to re-check
   ABG.
   3. NSTEMI- demand, most likely, although cannot r/o small thrombotic
   event. TTE w/o evidence of WMA.
   4. ARF- improved.
   5. Elevated Alk phos
 check GGT.
   6. Elevated INR
 likely nutritional, but slightly high.  No evidence
   of DIC or acute consumption.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who is currently in the ICU. He is unable to provide history due to sedation. The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including propofol, heparin sodium, metoprolol, and pantoprazole. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/60 mmHg to 134/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP mode, with a tidal volume of 380 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed due to sedation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Shock, septic: The patient is diagnosed with septic shock, which is a life-threatening complication of sepsis characterized by severe hypotension and poor organ perfusion.
2. Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient has been diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction, which refers to the death of heart muscle tissue due to inadequate blood supply. The specific type of myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI) is not mentioned.
3. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, which is a sudden and often temporary loss of kidney function.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to various factors such as immobility or pressure ulcers.
5. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has atrial fibrillation, a type of cardiac arrhythmia where the upper chambers of the heart beat irregularly and often rapidly.
6. Tachycardia, other: The patient has an elevated heart rate, which could be attributed to various causes such as fever, anxiety, or medication side effects.
7. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]): The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is characterized by inadequate gas exchange due to respiratory system dysfunction.
8. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) triggered by an infection, but without evidence of organ dysfunction at this time."

   failure.
   1.Septic shock
 now off vasopressors, stable.  Uo remains robust.
   Source remains most likely sacral decub, less c/w pulmonary. CXR w/
   retrocardiac opacity rapidly resolved. Nl [**Last Name (un) **] stim.
   -Complete linezolid/cefepime x 8days, complete [**12-13**], depending on
   cultures and further evaluation of decub.
   -Anticipate need for more definitive management of decub (plastics eval
   at [**Hospital1 **] or [**Hospital1 49**])
   2. Resp failure
  hypoxemic.  Plan to extubate today.  Secretions
   continue to improve, suctioning q4h.  If patient can follow commands
   adequately, will consider extubation.   h/o trach and prior
   oropharyngeal ca requires judicious assessment.
   -turn off versed/ fentanyl
   -SBT x at lease one hour given h/o oropharyngeal ca and prior trach.
   -On [**5-17**] had metabolic and resp acidosis (slight).  Plan to re-check
   ABG.
   3. NSTEMI- demand, most likely, although cannot r/o small thrombotic
   event. TTE w/o evidence of WMA.
   4. ARF- improved.
   5. Elevated Alk phos
 check GGT.
   6. Elevated INR
 likely nutritional, but slightly high.  No evidence
   of DIC or acute consumption.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of oropharyngeal cancer, severe burn injury with bilateral below-knee amputation (BKA), and severe sacral decubitus ulcer associated with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Septic shock - The patient was previously on vasopressors but is now stable and off them. The source of infection is most likely the sacral decubitus ulcer, although pulmonary infection is less likely. The patient is receiving complete linezolid/cefepime for 8 days, depending on cultures and further evaluation of the decubitus ulcer.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient is hypoxemic and plans are being made to extubate him today. Secretions continue to improve, and suctioning is done every 4 hours. If the patient can follow commands adequately, extubation will be considered. The patient has a history of tracheostomy and prior oropharyngeal cancer, which requires careful assessment.
3. NSTEMI - Although not confirmed, the patient may have experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not show any evidence of wall motion abnormality (WMA).
4. Acute renal failure (ARF) -"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and a chronic sacral wound. He was admitted with sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has since resolved his sepsis and respiratory failure, and his renal function has improved. However, he remains at risk for complications such as shock, myocardial infarction, impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock: The patient's history of sepsis and ongoing risk factors may predispose him to recurrent episodes of shock.
2. Myocardial infarction: Given the patient's NSTEMI and risk factors, there is a potential for further cardiac events.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The chronic sacral wound increases the risk of infection and impaired healing.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent episode of rapid ventricular response (RVR) indicate a continued risk for arrhythmias.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may indicate ongoing stress or potential complications.
6. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has been extubated and is oxygenating well, there is still a risk of respiratory compromise.
7. Sepsis: Despite resolution of initial septic"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and RVR, chronic sacral wound with NSTEMI and resolving sepsis. The patient has been through several medical complications and interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Shock, Septic: The patient was previously diagnosed with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection leading to low blood pressure and inadequate organ perfusion.

2. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): The patient had an acute myocardial infarction, specifically a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This is a type of heart attack where there is partial blockage of a coronary artery, leading to reduced blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart muscle.

3. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient experienced acute renal failure, where the kidneys fail to adequately filter waste products from the blood. This can result in the buildup of toxins and electrolyte imbalances, leading to further complications.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a chronic sacral wound, which may be due to impaired skin integrity. This can increase the risk of infection and other complications.

5. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular electrical signals in the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old nursing home resident admitted with suspected septic shock related to a sacral decubitus (pressure sore). The patient has been treated with antibiotics and is now off pressors. They also have a history of atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, chronic pain, and are being managed for a sacral decubitus. The patient has been extubated and is currently stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a suspected source of infection from the sacral decubitus. Blood cultures have been negative so far, but there is concern for osteomyelitis, and an MRI is planned to evaluate this further.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on heparin for DVT prophylaxis. This is important as immobility and hospitalization increase the risk of developing blood clots.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient is no longer intubated, there is still a risk of developing VAP due to previous respiratory failure and ICU stay.
4. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension and suspected shock. Although they have resolved from septic shock, there is still a risk of recurrent hypotension.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. Restarting beta-blockers may be necessary to manage this condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old nursing home resident admitted with suspected septic shock due to a sacral decubitus. The patient was extubated yesterday and has been stable overnight. They experienced a brief episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and responded well to IV lopressor. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/72 mmHg to 100/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except as noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with hypotension and suspected shock from a sacral decubitus. The septic shock has resolved, and the patient is no longer on pressors. However, there is still a concern for osteomyelitis, and an MRI will be done to evaluate this further. Surgery is also being considered for the decubitus.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced a brief episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was successfully managed with IV lopressor.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was previously intubated but was successfully extubated yesterday.
4. Pain Control: The patient requires ongoing pain"
