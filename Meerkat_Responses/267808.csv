","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have large bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and is currently in the ICU. The patient is hemodynamically stable but shows evidence of cardiac strain, with elevated troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide levels. She is being treated with IV heparin and will start warfarin therapy. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS) will be performed to evaluate the need for a vena cava filter. The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease or blood loss, and her hypernatremia has resolved. She has a fever, which is likely related to the large PEs. Her hypertension is exacerbated by the chest pain, so she will continue her home antihypertensive medications and hold nitrates. She also has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and asthma, for which she will continue her home treatments. The patient's glycemic control is well-managed, and she is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her code status is full code, and she is currently admitted to the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer, presents with chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have large bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs), indicating submassive PE. The patient is hemodynamically stable but shows evidence of cardiac strain, as indicated by elevated troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide levels. There are no recent prior instances of clotting, but the patient is at increased risk due to her history of endometrial cancer and obesity.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure reading of 162/98 mmHg and heart rate at 81 bpm. Oxygen saturation is 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient appears comfortable and has jugular venous distention of approximately 10 cm. Auscultation reveals occasional premature heartbeats but no murmurs, gallops, or regurgitation. Lung sounds show a few rales at the right base, but no wheezing is heard. The abdomen is soft, nontender with bowel sounds present. Extremities show bilateral edema that is symmetric and nontender, with warm and palpable pulses.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 225 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 125 mg/d"

","The patient's chief complaint is chest pain and shortness of breath. There were no major events overnight. The patient has allergies to Zestril (Lisinopril) and Norvasc (Amlodipine Besylate), with unknown reasons. The patient received infusions of Heparin Sodium and other ICU medications. There were no changes to the medical and family history. The review of systems shows that the patient's breathing and chest discomfort have improved slightly. 

The flowsheet data shows that the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/98 to 183/132 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 90.1 kg. Fluid balance shows an input of 21 mL and output of 880 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 859 mL. 

The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///23/. Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention to ~10cm, regular heart rhythm with occasional premature beats, rales in the left lung base, soft and non-tender abdomen, and bilateral edema in the extremities.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer presenting with chest pain and found to have large bilateral pulmonary embolisms. She is currently in the ICU for further management. 

The patient has been on IV heparin and will start warfarin in the evening. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) evaluation will be performed to assess her cardiac function. Additionally, the need for an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter will be evaluated.

The patient has several other medical issues, including hypertension, hypernatremia, low-grade fever, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and asthma. Her hypertension is likely exacerbated by the current chest pain. She will continue taking her home medications for hypertension and will hold nitrates due to concerns about dropping preload.

The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, maintaining an oxygen saturation of 99%. Her ABG results show normal levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH.

The patient's physical examination reveals jugular venous distention (JVD) of approximately 10 cm, regular heart rhythm with occasional premature beats, lungs with few rales at the left base, soft and non-tender abdomen, and extremities with bilateral edema.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.7 K/u"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently in remission. She presents with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise. The patient has risk factors for PE including obesity and a history of cancer. She is also experiencing hypokalemia, hypertension, and potential sleep apnea. The plan is to continue heparin therapy and start Coumadin this afternoon. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be done to evaluate the right heart strain. Considering the left lower extremity clot burden, a filter may be considered. It is also important to consult with the gynecologic oncology regarding potential malignancy recurrence. Pain management with morphine will be provided. The patient's code status remains as full code. The patient's condition will be reassessed after transferring to the floor if stable and if the lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) is negative.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient already has a confirmed PE and there is evidence of clot formation in the lower extremities. There is a risk of DVT progression or new DVT formation.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's submassive PE may lead to right heart strain and subsequently pulmonary hypertension if not managed appropriately.
3. Malignancy recurrence: Given the patient's history of endometrial cancer, there is a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently thought to be in remission. She presented with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise. There is no obvious inciting event identified, but the patient's history of cancer raises concerns about potential cancer recurrence and underlying obesity/sleep apnea. She has an elevated Pro-BNP level and mild troponin leak. 

The plan is to continue low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and evaluate for lower extremity clot burden. The patient will start on coumadin this afternoon. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed to assess the right heart function, which shows signs of tricuspid regurgitation with mild hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, consistent with right ventricular overload. 

The patient is also being evaluated for possible malignancy recurrence, pain control with morphine, and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Hypokalemia will be addressed by replenishing electrolytes, and hypertension management will involve restarting metoprolol and aiming for a systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 160 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cancer recurrence: Given the patient's history of endometrial cancer, there is a possibility of cancer recurrence, which could impact treatment decisions"

   TTE [**5-30**]  The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
   systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure overload. The ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta
   are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic
   regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-9-8**], the right
   ventricular cavity is now dilated with free wall hypokinesis and
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The severity of
   tricuspid regurgitation is also increased and pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension is also now present.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently in remission, presenting with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain on trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are some potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Cancer recurrence: Given the patient's history of endometrial cancer, there is a possibility of cancer recurrence. It is important to evaluate for lower extremity clot burden and touch base with gynecologic oncology to rule out any recurrence of malignancy.

2. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): The patient is obese and relatively sedentary, which increases the risk of OSA. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy should be continued at home to manage OSA.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and blood pressure should be closely monitored. The goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) should be less than 160 mmHg. Metoprolol should be continued as home medication.

4. Arrhythmia: The patient may have a potential arrhythmia, possibly atrial fibrillation (AFib) or premature atrial contractions (PACs). An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be checked to evaluate for any arrhythmias. Electrolyte imbalances should also be assessed, and"

   TTE [**5-30**]  The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
   systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure overload. The ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta
   are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic
   regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-9-8**], the right
   ventricular cavity is now dilated with free wall hypokinesis and
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The severity of
   tricuspid regurgitation is also increased and pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension is also now present.
   CXR [**5-31**]: no tubes/lines, good lung vols ? small left pleural effusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently in remission. She was admitted to the ICU for a submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, along with evidence of right ventricular strain on echocardiogram. She has an elevated Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP) and mild troponin leak. The patient's right atrium and ventricle are moderately dilated, and there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is also mild aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation. The patient's condition requires careful management due to the presence of multiple medical issues including anemia, hypertension, and potential arrhythmia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cancer recurrence: Given the patient's history of endometrial cancer, there is a possibility of cancer recurrence, which can complicate the treatment plan and overall prognosis.
2. Respiratory distress: The presence of a submassive PE and pulmonary hypertension increases the risk of respiratory distress, especially if the patient develops further clot burden or complications related to right ventricular dysfunction.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's elevated Pro-BNP, mild troponin leak, and history of clean catheterization suggest a potential for cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or premature atrial contractions (PACs).

   TTE [**5-30**]  The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
   systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure overload. The ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta
   are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic
   regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-9-8**], the right
   ventricular cavity is now dilated with free wall hypokinesis and
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The severity of
   tricuspid regurgitation is also increased and pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension is also now present.
   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo obese and relatively sedentary female with hx of endometrial CA
   ([**2133**]) thought to be in remission and now with submassive PE without
   hemodynamic compromise
   > PE: submassive by appearance without hemodynamic compromise. No
   obvious inciting event although she does have this history of cancer
   which raises the question of cancer recurrence and underlying
   obesity/sleep apnea.   She does have an elevated Pro-BNP and mild trop
   leak. For now the most reasonable strategy would be to cont Hep gtt and
   eval for lower ext clot burden. Not surprisingly there is some evidence
   of RV vol/pressure overload. I would still favor a strategy which uses
   only Heparin The role for lytics in this case is not clear as data
   indicated quicker resolution of underlying RV dysfunction with the use
   of lytics but no overall change to mortality (plus the increased risl
   of bleeding with lytics)

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer in remission, now presenting with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise.
- There is no obvious inciting event for the PE, but the patient's history of cancer raises concerns about cancer recurrence and underlying obesity/sleep apnea.
- The patient has an elevated Pro-BNP and mild troponin leak.
- There is evidence of right ventricular volume/pressure overload.
- The plan is to continue heparin gtt and evaluate for lower extremity clot burden.
- The role for lytics in this case is unclear, as data indicate quicker resolution of underlying RV dysfunction with the use of lytics but no overall change in mortality (plus increased risk of bleeding).
- The patient should be bridged with enoxaparin and coumadin, and further discussion with gynecologic oncology regarding possible recurrence of malignancy is needed.
- Pain control with morphine should be continued, and home CPAP for OSA should be continued.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, which should be managed with home medications, including restarting metoprolol, and maintaining a goal systolic blood pressure below 160 mmHg.
- Other remaining issues include nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, VAP, and communication.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer, who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have large bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and is now being managed in the ICU. 

The patient has been diagnosed with submassive PE, which means there is evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain without systemic hypotension. This is indicated by elevated troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The patient's right ventricle (RV) shows hypokinesis, and there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 

The plan includes continuing intravenous heparin and considering a switch to low molecular weight heparin (lovenox). Warfarin will be started this evening, and a filter will be placed given the negative lower extremity Doppler ultrasound (LENS). 

The patient is also being closely monitored for anemia, fever, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and asthma. She will continue with her home medications for these conditions and receive regular diet and glycemic control in the ICU.

The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status, meaning no cardiac resuscitation will be performed if intubation is required. She will be transferred to the floor once her condition stabilizes."

   The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
   systolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   pressure overload. The ascending aorta and descending thoracic aorta
   are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic
   regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-9-8**], the right

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of hypertension and benign pulmonary embolism. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events include an echocardiogram showing right ventricular hypokinesis, no clot, and left-sided ultrasound without deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The decision was made to continue with heparin therapy due to uncertainty regarding the dosing of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with increased clot burden. The patient is not called out for dyspnea with any movement and is on 5 liters of nasal cannula oxygen.

Allergies include Zestril (lisinopril) and Norvasc (amlodipine besylate), both of which are unknown. The patient received infusions of heparin sodium and other ICU medications. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for improved chest pain and breathing today. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 84 bpm (77-95 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 142/98 mmHg to 170/144 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (14-37 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer, presenting with symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. She has been diagnosed with large bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs), and her hemodynamics are stable. However, there is evidence of right heart strain on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), as well as elevated troponin and brain natriuretic peptide levels. The patient is currently receiving intravenous heparin and warfarin therapy, with plans to switch to low molecular weight heparin once stable. Filter placement has been held due to negative leg venous ultrasonography findings. Pain management and close follow-up with gynecologic oncology are recommended given her history of recurrent cancer. Anemia is being closely monitored, and there are no signs of bleeding. Low-grade fever is likely secondary to the large PEs. Hypernatremia is likely due to increased insensible losses from low-grade temperatures, tachypnea, and inadequate oral intake. Hypertension is exacerbated by current chest pain. OSA and asthma management continue with home CPAP and inhaler use. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control are being maintained through a PO diet. Prophylactic measures include systemic anticoagulation for DVT, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP precautions. The patient's code status is DNR, with short-term intubation"

   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the size of the
   cardiac
   silhouette has minimally increased. There is also a minimal increase in
   intrathoracic fluid content, however there are no overt signs of
   pulmonary
   edema. No evidence of pleural effusions. No focal parenchymal opacities
   suggesting pneumonia.
   Assessment and Plan
   This 76F with h/o endometrial CA presents with CP and found to have
   large bilateral PEs.
   .
   * Submassive PE
   No prior history of clot, but at increased risk with h/o endometrial CA
   and obesity. Hemodynamically stable, however evidence of RH strain on
   TTE and mild trop and BNP elevation (no recent priors), however trop
   now trending down with flat CK and MB.
   - change to lovenox given no plan for procedure
   - Continue warfarin until INR therapeutic x2d
   - Will hold on filter given negative LENIs
   - Standing tylenol with breakthrough MSIR for pain control, uptitrate
   if needed
   - Make Gyn/Onc aware of this event given that she may need close f/u to
   rule out recurrent CA.
   - Repeat TTE as outpt 4-6 weeks
   .
   * Anemia:  Hct trended down to 27 (from 31) yesterday, baseline appears
   to be in low 30s. No evidence of bleeding, however is on heparin.
   Previously treated with iron.  Hct better today at 30.
   - Cont. to follow closely
   .
   * Fever, low grade
   Probably due to large PEs
   - Follow clinically, UA without pyuria no convincing evidence of pna
   .
   * Hypernatremia
   - Encourage PO, follow Na. Increased insensible losses with low grade
   temps, tachypnea
   .
   * Hypertension
   Likely exacerbated by current chest pain.
   - Continue losartan, HCTZ, BB
   - Will hold nitrates due to concern for dropping preload
   - Pain control
   .
   * OSA
   - Continue home CPAP
   .
   * Asthma
   - Continue home salmeterol and albuterol prn

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath. She has been diagnosed with large bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs). 

The patient is hemodynamically stable but shows evidence of right heart strain on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and mild troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide elevation. The patient's troponin levels are now trending down with flat creatine kinase (CK) and MB levels. 

The plan includes changing to low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) due to no planned procedure, continuing warfarin until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic for two days, holding on the filter given negative lower extremity Doppler ultrasounds (LENS), and standing up titratable pain control with Tylenol as needed.

Other issues include anemia with a hemoglobin concentration trending down to 27% (from 31%) yesterday but now better at 30%. This is being closely followed, especially considering the patient's heparin therapy. 

The patient also has a low-grade fever, which is likely due to the large PEs. It is being followed clinically, and there is no evidence of pneumonia on the chest radiograph. 

Hypernatremia is being encouraged to drink more fluids orally and follow sodium levels, as increased insensible losses are expected with low-grade temperatures, tachypnea"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath. She has been diagnosed with large bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient is hemodynamically stable but shows evidence of right heart strain on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and mild troponin and brain natriuretic peptide elevation. She has no prior history of clot but is at increased risk due to her history of endometrial cancer and obesity. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, but there are minimal increases in creatinine and BUN levels. Her hemoglobin concentration has decreased slightly, likely due to the large PEs. The patient also has low-grade fever, hypernatremia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. She is receiving systemic anticoagulation with heparin and will be transitioned to lovenox. Warfarin will be continued until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic for two days. The patient's pain is better controlled, and she is more comfortable breathing. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's history of cancer and obesity, she is at an increased risk for developing DVTs. The use of anticoagulation therapy is appropriate to prevent further clot formation.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The right heart strain"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of endometrial cancer who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have large bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and is now being treated in the ICU. The patient has no prior history of clotting but is at increased risk due to her history of endometrial cancer and obesity. She is hemodynamically stable but shows evidence of right heart strain on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), with elevated troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide levels. The patient's pain is being managed with Tylenol and morphine sulfate intravenously (MSIR), and she will continue to receive IV heparin and warfarin until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic. A filter will not be placed given the negative lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS).

Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been trending down, possibly due to ongoing bleeding while on heparin. Close monitoring and potential transfusion may be necessary.
2. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, which may be attributed to the large PEs. Clinical follow-up is recommended, and further evaluation for pneumonia should be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 yo obese and relatively sedentary female with hx of endometrial CA
   ([**2133**]) thought to be in remission and now with submassive PE without
   hemodynamic compromise and evidence of RV strain on TTE.
    > PE: submassive by appearance without hemodynamic compromise. No
   obvious inciting event although she does have this history of cancer
   which raises the question of cancer recurrence and underlying
   obesity/sleep apnea.   She does have an elevated Pro-BNP and mild trop
   leak. For now the most reasonable strategy would be to cont Hep gtt and
   eval for lower ext clot burden. Not surprisingly there is some evidence
   of RV vol/pressure overload. I would still favor a strategy which uses
   only Heparin The role for lytics in this case is not clear as data
   indicate quicker resolution of underlying RV dysfunction with the use
   of lytics but no overall change to mortality (plus the increased risl
   of bleeding with lytics).
   - Enoxaparin and coumadin bridge today: 5 mg coumadin
   - LENI (-), no role for filter.
   - touch base with gyn-onc re: ? recurrence of malignancy
   - pain control with morphine and standing Tylenol.
    > Anemia: ? anemia of chronic disease with stably low Hct (30).
   - repeat Fe studies
   > OSA: cont home CPAP

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently in remission. She presents with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise, evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and an elevated Pro-BNP level. The patient also has mild troponin leak and is experiencing anemia, hypertension, and possible arrhythmia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of malignancy: Given the patient's history of endometrial cancer, there is a possibility of cancer recurrence, which should be evaluated further.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has submassive PE and RV strain, indicating a potential risk for developing DVT. Prophylaxis with systemic anticoagulation using heparin is already in place.
3. Hypertension: The patient has uncontrolled hypertension despite being on metoprolol. The goal blood pressure should be maintained below 160 mmHg.

   hemodynamic compromise and evidence of RV strain on TTE.
    > PE: submassive by appearance without hemodynamic compromise. No
   obvious inciting event although she does have this history of cancer
   which raises the question of cancer recurrence and underlying
   obesity/sleep apnea.   She does have an elevated Pro-BNP and mild trop
   leak. For now the most reasonable strategy would be to cont Hep gtt and
   eval for lower ext clot burden. Not surprisingly there is some evidence
   of RV vol/pressure overload. I would still favor a strategy which uses
   only Heparin The role for lytics in this case is not clear as data
   indicate quicker resolution of underlying RV dysfunction with the use
   of lytics but no overall change to mortality (plus the increased risl
   of bleeding with lytics).

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently in remission. She presents with submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise and evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient has an elevated Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and mild troponin leak. There is no obvious inciting event for the PE, but possible underlying factors include obesity, sleep apnea, and history of cancer. The patient's other medical history includes hypertension, controlled with metoprolol, losartan, and HCTZ; and a clean catheterization from 2013 with a previous troponin leak. The patient's current treatment plan includes enoxaparin and coumadin bridge therapy, pain control with morphine and Tylenol, home CPAP for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and up titration of metoprolol to 37.5 mg three times a day. The patient also has a history of asthma, for which she will continue using Advair and nebulizers. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and her disposition is transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of malignancy: Given the patient's history of endometrial cancer, there is a possibility of cancer recurrence. Close"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old obese female with a history of endometrial cancer, currently in remission. She presents with a submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) without hemodynamic compromise and evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The patient has an elevated Pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP) and mild troponin leak. She is being managed with heparin, and the role of lytics is uncertain. Other comorbidities include hypertension, which is being treated with metoprolol, losartan, and HCTZ, and asthma, for which she is using Advair and nebulizers. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she is planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of Malignancy: Given the patient's history of endometrial cancer, there is a possibility of cancer recurrence, which may require further intervention and treatment.
2. Pulmonary Embolism Complications: The patient has a submassive PE with evidence of RV strain. Complications such as recurrent PE, pulmonary hypertension, or right heart failure could arise if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
