   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach today at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent
   is presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness. her pneumonia appears to
   have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia. Nonetheless, she is
   on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness preceeded her
   critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary process. She
   does not appear to have had prlongued illness or steroid use.
   - continue 10 day course cefepime and moxiflox (today day [**7-19**])
   - continue PS with goal to wean, daily RSBI and SBT
   - try sitting upright to see if diaphragmatic paralysis
   - apprec neurology recs
   - f/u outpt muscle bx results. Per OSH ICU attd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], call

   - d/w neuro re: nerve bx
   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   - repeat CXR tonight
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.
   - neurology c/s in am
   - I will email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4690**], her outpt neurologist, tonight
   - check cryo levels

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, and tracheostomy after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistent difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has resolving respiratory failure from aspiration pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and recently underwent tracheostomy. Her difficulty weaning from the ventilator is presumptively due to neuromuscular weakness. Her pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly, but there is a question of pneumonitis versus pneumonia. She is on a 10-day course of antibiotics.
2. Myopathy/Neuropathy: The patient is being followed by neurology for myopathy/neuropathy, possibly mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with HCV. Recent neurology outpatient visit showed mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several proximal muscles. Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to evaluate the nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of vasculitic neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.
3. HCV: The patient is stable on peg interferon maintenance. She should continue with liver recommendations, continue IFN every week, and can restart nadolol if blood pressure and heart rate are tolerated."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV), cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, and tracheostomy after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistent difficulty weaning from the ventilator. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, which is now resolving. The patient's pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly, but she continues to experience difficulty weaning from the ventilator, presumed to be due to neuromuscular weakness. She is on a 7-day course of antibiotics and will undergo further evaluation by neurology and liver specialists to determine the etiology of her muscle weakness. Muscle and nerve biopsies are planned to evaluate the nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, but it is now resolving.
2. Neuromuscular weakness: The patient's progressive neuromuscular weakness is presumed to be the cause of her persistent difficulty weaning from the ventilator. Further evaluation by neurology and liver specialists is planned.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient had aspiration pneumonia, which has cleared rapidly.
4. Difficulty weaning from the ventilator: The patient continues to experience difficulty weaning from the ventilator, likely due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach today at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent
   is presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness. her pneumonia appears to
   have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia. Nonetheless, she is
   on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness preceeded her
   critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, will get ID approval
   - continue PS with goal to wean, daily RSBI and SBT; did well with
   decrease PS this morning
   - try sitting upright to see if diaphragmatic paralysis
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
   - f/u outpt muscle bx results. Per OSH ICU attd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], call
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.
   - cyro levels pending
   - neuron consult and will touch base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4690**]; plan for possible
   nerve biopsy and / or EMG
   .
   # HCV: stable on peg interferon maintenance
   - appreciate liver recs
   - continue IFN Q week, although need to consider IFN as toxic cause of
   her myopathy
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - tx with morphine for now, can transition to long acting pain control
   when G tube or NG place
   - IVF boluses PRN
   - IV metoprolol standing for heart rate control and cardioprotection in
   setting of NSTEMI
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - NPO tonight
   - continuing PPI, stopping ranitidine today
   - will discuss with liver if PEG tube can be placed
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH, plts to
   20's and OSH stopped heparin with concern for HIT. No HIT sent yet.
   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products
   - check HIT Ab
   .
   # NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia at OSH
   - trending troponins, CKs negative; EKGs without signs of ischemia
   - holding aspirin
   - metoprolol as above for tachycardia
   .
   # FEN:
   - maintenance fluids
   - replete electrolytes
   - tube feeds after NGT or PEG placement
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - pneumoboots
   - PPI
   .
   # Access:
   - RIJ from OSH (placed on [**1-18**]); plan for PIVs and then d/c of RIJ if

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, and persistent difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient's current medical complications include hypoxic respiratory failure, myopathy/neuropathy, HCV, tachycardia, dysphagia, thrombocytopenia, NSTEMI, and FEN.

The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is resolving, and she has undergone tracheostomy. Her difficulty weaning from the ventilator is presumed to be due to neuromuscular weakness. She is on a 7-day course of antibiotics for pneumonia and will continue PS with the goal of weaning. Daily RSBI and SBT will be performed, and the patient will be tried sitting upright to assess for diaphragmatic paralysis.

The patient also has myopathy/neuropathy, which is being followed by neurology. The EMG showed mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several proximal muscles. Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to evaluate the nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of vasculitic neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.

Regarding HCV, the patient is stable on peg interferon maintenance therapy. However, consideration should be given to IFN as a toxic cause of her myopathy.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach [**1-25**] at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent is
   presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness, although improving. her
   pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia.
   Nonetheless, she is on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness
   preceeded her critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary
   process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, last day today
   - continue PS with goal to wean, daily RSBI and SBT; continuing to
   improve, will do trach collar trial today
   - NIF is still -18 today
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
   - f/u outpt muscle bx results. Per OSH ICU attd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], call
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.
   - cyro levels pending
   - neuron consult; plan for EMG and a nerve biopsy with neurosurg (Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 67**]
   - will follow up OSH biopsy, plan is to have specimen sent to [**Hospital1 **] after
   it is fixed
   .
   # HCV: stable on peg interferon maintenance
   - appreciate liver recs, abd US done and showed no ascites; question is
   now PEG v. dobhoff
   - holding INF as it may  be possible cause of weakness
   - HCV virus and cyro levels pending
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - improved, rates in 90s-100s mostly now
   - tx with morphine for now, can transition to long acting pain control
   when G tube or NG place
   - on maintenance fluids for now
   - IV metoprolol standing for heart rate control and cardioprotection in
   setting of NSTEMI; will switch from IV to PO nadolol when access to gut
   is achieved
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - NPO tonight
   - continuing PPI, stopped ranitidine
   - will discuss with liver if PEG tube can be placed; likely can be
   placed since no ascites
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH, plts to
   20's and OSH stopped heparin with concern for HIT. No HIT sent yet.
   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products
   - check HIT Ab
 results pending
   .
   # NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia at OSH
   - trending troponins, CKs negative; EKGs without signs of ischemia
   - holding aspirin
   - metoprolol as above for tachycardia
   .
   # FEN:
   - maintenance fluids
   - replete electrolytes
   - tube feeds after NGT or PEG placement per liver recs, likely should
   have PEG to avoid two procedures as likely will need long term feeding
   options
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - pneumoboots
   - PPI
   - no heparin problems

She has been treated for aspiration pneumonia and appears to have cleared rapidly. The patient's weakness predated her critical illness, and it is suspected that cryoglobulinemia may be the primary process.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially had resolving respiratory failure due to pneumonia and ARDS but now has difficulty weaning from the ventilator. It is presumptively neuromuscular weakness, although improving.

2. Myopathy/Neuropathy: The patient is followed by neurology for myopathy/neuropathy, possibly mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with HCV. An EMG showed a mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several proximal muscles. Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to evaluate the nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.

3. HCV: The patient is stable on peg interferon maintenance but holding INF as it may be a possible cause of weakness. HCV virus and cryo levels are pending.

4. Tachycardia:"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach [**1-25**] at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent is
   presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness, although improving. her
   pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia.
   Nonetheless, she is on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness
   preceeded her critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary
   process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, last day today
   - continue PS with goal to wean, daily RSBI and SBT; continuing to
   improve, will do trach collar trial today
   - NIF is still -18 today
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
   - f/u outpt muscle bx results. Per OSH ICU attd, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], call
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.
   - cyro levels pending
   - neuron consult; plan for EMG and a nerve biopsy with neurosurg (Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 67**]
   - will follow up OSH biopsy, plan is to have specimen sent to [**Hospital1 **] after
   it is fixed

   # HCV: stable on peg interferon maintenance
   - appreciate liver recs, abd US done and showed no ascites; question is
   now PEG v. dobhoff
   - holding INF as it may  be possible cause of weakness
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - improved, rates in 90s-100s mostly now
   - tx with morphine for now, can transition to long acting pain control
   when G tube or NG place
   - on maintenance fluids for now
   - IV metoprolol standing for heart rate control and cardioprotection in
   setting of NSTEMI
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - NPO tonight
   - continuing PPI, stopped ranitidine
   - will discuss with liver if PEG tube can be placed; likely can be
   placed since no ascites
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH, plts to
   20's and OSH stopped heparin with concern for HIT. No HIT sent yet.
   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products
   - check HIT Ab

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, and prior aspiration pneumonia. She has been in the ICU for several days due to hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia and possible neuromuscular weakness. She is currently on mechanical ventilation but is expected to be weaned off soon. Her pneumonia appears to have resolved, and she is being treated with cefepime for a total of 10 days. The patient also has myopathy/neuropathy, which is suspected to be related to mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with HCV. She has had an EMG showing mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy and myopathic process in several proximal muscles. Muscle and nerve biopsies are needed to evaluate the nature of her myopathy and look for evidence of vasculitic neuropathy in the setting of cryoglobulinemia. Other differentials include vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like dermatomyositis or other myosities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty in weaning from the ventilator suggests that there may be ongoing respiratory compromise, which could lead to recurrent hypoxic respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: Although the patient's pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly, there is still a possibility of recurrent infection due to her immunocompromised state and"

   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistant difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.  Working diagnosis is an INF
   related primary myopathy with an underlying secondary neuropathy
   related to cyroglobulemiia.  Neuro and neurosurg following
   - cyro levels pending
   - plan to review OSH muscle biopsies with neuro. OSH doctor is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
   call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])
   - possible plan for nerve biopsy tomorrow, may be pending the muscle
   biopsy results whether or not it is needed; Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 67**] is following and
   she is scheduled for OR tomorrow
   - appreciate neuro and neurosurg recs
   .
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach [**1-25**] at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent is
   presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness, although improving. her
   pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia.
   Nonetheless, she is on a [**7-19**] day course abx. Given that her weakness
   preceeded her critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary
   process.
   - complete 10 day of cefepime, [**1-27**]
   - doing well on trach mask trial
   - consult neuron/liver for help determining etiology of muscle weakness
    - continue nebs given hx asthma
   .
   # HCV: stable, viral load undetectable
   - appreciate liver recs, abd US done and showed minimal ascites
   - dobhoff placed yesterday, starting nutrition; will have to follow up
   long term nutrition plans
   - holding INF as it may  be possible cause of weakness
   - cyro levels pending
   .
   # Corneal abrasion and conjunctivitis
 opthamology following;
   - tx with lacrilube ointment q 1hr, lacrilube drops q2 hr and cipro
   gtts q 6hrs
   - at risk for worsening corneal damage in setting of muscle weakness
   and inability to close eyes; will need close eye care for now and
   follow up with opthomology
   .
   # Tachycardia
 likely from pain as responsive to morphine; could also
   be fluid down.
   - improved, rates in 90s-100s mostly now
   - tx with morphine for now, requiring less and less medicine
   - starting tube feeds now that dobhoff placed
   - transitioned back to nadolol for varicies; can titrate up as needed
   .
   # Dysphagia: seen by neuro and ENT as well as S&S eval in [**10-17**]. Felt
   to have laryngeal reflux.
   - NPO tonight
   - continuing PPI, stopped ranitidine
   - dobhoff in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: baseline in last 6 months 50-70's. At OSH, plts to
   20's and OSH stopped heparin with concern for HIT. No HIT sent yet.
   - trend and transfuse for plt <20 or bleeding
   - hold all heparin products
   - check HIT Ab  - negative

   # NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia at OSH
   - trending troponins, CKs negative; EKGs without signs of ischemia
   - holding aspirin
   - nadolol as above for tachycardia

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, tracheostomy after intubation for aspiration pneumonia, persistent difficulty weaning from the ventilator, and ongoing management of various medical conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Myopathy/Neuropathy: The patient has been diagnosed with mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with HCV. This condition is causing sensorimotor polyneuropathy and a myopathic process in several proximal muscles. Muscle and nerve biopsies are planned to evaluate the nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient had resolving respiratory failure from pneumonia/ARDS and required a tracheostomy. Her difficulty weaning from the ventilator is presumed to be due to neuromuscular weakness. She is on a 7-day course of antibiotics and is doing well on a tracheostomy trial. 

3. HCV: The patient's HCV is stable, with an undetectable viral load. Her liver function needs to be monitored, and she is holding interferon therapy as it may be the cause of muscle weakness. Cryoglobulin levels are pending.

4. Corneal abrasion and conj"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, tracheostomy after intubation for aspiration pneumonia, and persistent difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient has been on a 10-day course of cefepime, which will be completed today. She is expected to be extubated soon. The patient's respiratory failure from PNA/ARDS has resolved rapidly. However, she still requires noninvasive ventilation support due to neuromuscular weakness, although she is improving. Her pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly, and she is on a 7-day course of antibiotics. The patient's difficulty weaning from the ventilator is presumptively attributed to neuromuscular weakness. She is being evaluated by neurology, and muscle and nerve biopsies are needed to further evaluate the nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of vasculitic neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia. Other differentials include vitamin deficiencies and rheumatological problems like dermatomyositis or other myosities. The patient's myopathy/neuropathy is mixed, as evidenced by EMG showing a mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several proximal muscles.

   added erythromycin drops at night to L eye
   - neurosurg preop completed with type and screen, UA, CXR
   - waiting for OSH path prior to nerve biopsy, because if specimen is
   inadequate would like to do both muscle and nerve biopsy at the same

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient's speech and swallow evaluation today could not handle the Passy-Muir valve yet, and will try again on Friday. The patient was tachycardic in the afternoon, appeared dry perhaps from autodiuresis with low K/Phos, and was given IVFs, which improved overnight. The patient is still awaiting OSH path prior to nerve biopsy because if the specimen is inadequate, they would like to do both muscle and nerve biopsy at the same time. The plan is to proceed with the nerve biopsy on Monday if not tomorrow, and they need to touch base with both neuro and neurosurg today about the finalized plan. The patient was agitated overnight and did not sleep much, did not respond to morphine or ativan, and can consider adding sleeping medicine tomorrow night like trazadone.

Medical Allergies:
No known drug allergies.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, and myopathy, other (not of critical illness). The patient is currently receiving various treatments and interventions, including mechanical ventilation, IV fluids, and medications for prophylaxis against DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and dependence on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to excessive pressure during ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the acute illness and ICU stay, making him susceptible to infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, or pneumonia.
3. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobilization and impaired skin integrity increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and delayed wound healing.
4. Muscle Weakness: The patient's myopathy may worsen over time, resulting in increased muscle weakness and reduced mobility.
5. Nutritional Deficiencies: Impaired nutrition can lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, affecting the patient's recovery process.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased blood flow can increase the risk of DVT formation, which may lead to complications like pulmonary embolism if"

   This is a 55 y/o F hx HCV on IFN, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia,
   progressive neuromuscular weakness followed by neurology now s/p trach
   after intubation for aspiration pneumonia and persistent difficulty
   weaning from vent.
   .
   .
   # Myopathy/Neuropathy: She is followed by neurology.
   Myopathy/neuropathy felt possibly [**1-11**] mixed cryoglobulinemia associated
   with HCV. Per recent neurology outpatient visit, EMG showed a mild
   sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a myopathic process in several
   proximal muscles (IP, biceps, infraspinatus, and prominently in L3
   paraspinals).  Muscle and nerve biopsy are needed to help evaluate the
   nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of a vasculitic
   neuropathy in the setting of her cryoglobulinemia.  Other differential
   includes vitamin deficiencies, rheumatological problems like
   dermatomyositis or other myosities.  Working diagnosis is an INF
   related primary myopathy with an underlying secondary neuropathy
   related to cyroglobulemiia.  Neuro and neurosurg following
   - cryo levels pending
   - plan to review OSH muscle biopsies with neuro. OSH doctor is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
   call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4688**] for bx results (or can page Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4689**])

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: She now has resolving resp failure from
   PNA/ARDS now s/p trach [**1-25**] at OSH. Her difficulty weaning from vent is
   presumptively [**1-11**] neuromuscular weakness, although improving. her
   pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly. ? pneumonitis vs pneumonia.
   Completed course of cefepime on [**1-27**]. Given that her weakness preceeded
   her critical illness, I suspect cryoglobulinemia as primary process.
   - completed 10 day of cefepime on [**1-27**]
   - doing well on trach mask trial
   - continue nebs given hx asthma

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HCV, cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, progressive neuromuscular weakness, and tracheostomy after intubation for aspiration pneumonia. She has difficulty weaning from the ventilator, which is presumed to be due to neuromuscular weakness. Her pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly, and she completed a course of cefepime on 01/27. She is doing well on a tracheostomy trial and continues nebs given her history of asthma. She also has a corneal abrasion and conjunctivitis, which are being treated with lacrilube ointment and cipro gtts. She has tachycardia, likely from pain or fluid loss, and has improved with morphine. She has thrombocytopenia, with platelets in the 20s at OSH, and has been started on heparin for prophylaxis. She has a history of NSTEMI, but her troponins and CKs are negative, and she has no signs of ischemia on EKGs. She is being held on aspirin and nadolol for tachycardia. She has dysphagia, which is being evaluated by neurology and ENT. She failed a PMV trial on 01/28 due to coughing/secretions. She has hypoxic respiratory failure from PNA"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C virus (HCV), cryoglobulinemia, dysphagia, and progressive neuromuscular weakness. She was admitted to the ICU for aspiration pneumonia and persistent difficulty weaning from the ventilator. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including tracheostomy, nutritional support, and medications for HCV, cryoglobulinemia, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myopathy/Neuropathy: The patient has mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with HCV, which may be causing a mild sensorimotor polyneuropathy and myopathic process in several muscles. Muscle and nerve biopsies are needed to evaluate the nature of her myopathy and to look for evidence of vasculitic neuropathy.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient had resolving respiratory failure from pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and now has difficulty weaning from the ventilator. This could be due to neuromuscular weakness, although improving. Pneumonia appears to have cleared rapidly, but there is a possibility of pneumonitis versus pneumonia.

3. HCV: The patient's viral load is undetectable, but she has stable HCV infection. It is important to follow up with liver recommendations and abdominal ultrasound findings.

4. Corneal abrasion and conjunctivitis: The patient has an ongoing corneal"
