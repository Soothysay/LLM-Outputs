   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to combination of
   large left sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.  No
   evidence of obstructive airways disease on exam to explain her
   hypercarbia.  Also no clear evidence to support acute change such as PE
   to cause her symptoms.  Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib
   w/RVR and diastolic dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No
   preceding PNA or pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or
   empyema.
   -IP to place pigtail drain at bedside today to relieve pleural effusion
   and hopefully allow for re-expansion of L lung
   -start lasix gtt for improved diuresis
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol
   -continue to support nutritional status
   -send pleural fluid for analysis
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled.
   -continue metoprolol
   .
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - will transition to heparin gtt following thoracentesis today
   -restart coumadin tomorrow if doing well post [**Female First Name (un) 217**]
   .
   #Anasarca - likely [**1-29**] diastolic chf c/b afib w/rvr as well as poor
   nutritional status.
   -start lasix gtt if stable following procedure with goal diuresis -1-2L
   -f/u [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and replete prn
   -monitor bicarb, may need to hold off on diuresis if appears to be
   intravascularly depleted (does have slight creatinine/HCO3 bump today)
   -continue to support nutrition
   .
   #. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Stable
   - continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   .
   #C.diff - diagnosed during her recent admission, started on flagyl, no
   apparent complications.
   - continue flagyl to be completed on [**2101-11-15**] (7 days after ampicillin
   stopped)
   .
   #Skin breakdown - she has multiple areas of skin breakdown likely due
   to poor nutritional status and anasarca as well as new paralysis.
   -continue to support nutritional status, appreciate nutrition reccs
   -f/u wound care reccs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a complicated medical history, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and lower extremity paralysis. She is admitted with worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been experiencing respiratory distress. The patient's recent medical history includes bilateral leg paralysis and now presents with acute impaired skin integrity. She has been diagnosed with a pleural effusion and lung collapse in the left lung. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilatory support and requires drainage of effusions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing worsening hypercarbic respiratory failure, and there is a need for close monitoring and appropriate respiratory support.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion in the left lung, which needs to be drained to improve ventilation and perfusion.
3. Pneumothorax (PTX): There is a risk of developing a pneumothorax on the right side due to the presence of lung collapse. Continuous monitoring is necessary.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for further clot formation. Heparin therapy may be required.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation, which needs to be managed with rate control measures and heparin therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to combination of
   large left sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.  No
   evidence of obstructive airways disease on exam to explain her
   hypercarbia.  Also no clear evidence to support acute change such as PE
   to cause her symptoms.  Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib
   w/RVR and diastolic dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No
   preceding PNA or pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or
   empyema.   Pleural fluid looks like transudative process.
   -IP to place second pigtail catheter in R side today
   - Chest CT after procedure to further evaluate underlying lung
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol
   -continue to support nutritional status
   - consider Lasix gtt if BP tolerates today
   - f/u CXR after [**Female First Name (un) 217**]
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled.
   -continue metoprolol
   .
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - will transition to heparin gtt following thoracentesis today

Ms. [Known Lastname] is a 71-year-old female with a history of bilateral lower extremity paralysis, previous fall with epidural hematoma and cord compression, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation, large left-sided pleural effusion, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being managed for multiple medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a large left-sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis, which can contribute to hypercarbia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is essential to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient is being treated with metoprolol to control her heart rate. It is important to monitor her heart rate and rhythm closely to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure exacerbation.
3. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient's anasarca (generalized edema) and poor nutritional status may contribute to diastolic dysfunction. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload or worsening heart failure is necessary.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and an IVC filter placement. She will be transitioned to heparin g"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis.  No evidence of obstructive
   airways disease on exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed no PT
   but had multifocal pneumonia.  Effusion most likely due to combination
   of Afib w/RVR and diastolic dysfunction as well as poor nutritional
   status.  No preceding PNA or pulmonary mass to support malignant
   effusion or empyema.   Pleural fluid looks like transudative process.
   CXR in evening shows apical pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail
   placement)
   - Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital acquired pneumonia
 will give
   10 day course since patient afebrile, not producing sputum
   - to consider BAL sample if cannot get sputum sample
   - blood culture
   -urine legionella Cx
   -repeat cxr to eval for worsening pneumothorax
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol, hold for hypotension
   -continue to support nutritional status
 encourage PO intake
   #Hypotension: Improved with 2L of NS last night.  Patient with UOP last
   night usually >30cc/hr.  Hypotension likely a combination of poor PO
   intake over last 48 hours, aggressive diuresis at rehab facility, and
   high output from pigtail catheters (R side produced 1L fluid in approx
   10 hours yesterday)
   -          500 cc NS boluses as needed
   -          Encourage PO intake
   -          Maintenance fluids
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled.
   -continue metoprolol
   .
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - will transition to heparin gtt following thoracentesis today
   -d/w IP when to re-start coumadin

","The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of bilateral lower extremity paralysis, epidural hematoma, and cord compression following a fall. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation (Afib), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory distress and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/55 mmHg to 83/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and is receiving supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination reveals morbid obesity, pale appearance, tachypnea, and irregularly irregular heart rhythm. The patient has decreased breath sounds over the left apex and bronchial breath sounds bilaterally. There is pitting edema present in both lower extremities. The patient also has multiple areas of skin breakdown, but no acute infections are evident.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7.9 g/dL, platelet count of 429 x 10^9/L, and creatinine (Cr) level of 1.0 mg/dL. The patient's blood glucose level is 167 mg/dL, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows a large left-sided pleural effusion, apical pneumonia, and no pneumothorax. The pleural fluid analysis indicates a transudative process. A computed tomography (CT) scan reveals multifocal pneumonia but no pulmonary thromboembolism (PT).

The patient's medical plan includes:
1. Vancomycin and levofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Repeat chest X-ray to evaluate for worsening pneumothorax.
3. Blood culture.
4. Urine Legionella test.
5. Continue rate control with metoprolol, holding for hypotension.
6. Encourage oral intake.
7. Continue to support nutritional status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 126 kg, 64-inch tall male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pleural effusion. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, and impaired skin integrity. 

24-hour events include the placement of a chest tube on the right side, which drained 1000cc of bloody fluid by midnight. A pigtail catheter was also placed on the right side, and a subclavian line was inserted. The patient experienced hypotension with low blood pressure readings in the 50s while sleeping. Fluids were given to improve the mean arterial pressure (MAP), and a chest X-ray showed improving right-sided effusion without pneumothorax. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) decreased from 27.3% to 24.7% due to high output from the pigtail catheter.

The patient has allergies to anesthesia tray, nausea/vomiting, and is currently receiving fentanyl and heparin infusions. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent events. 

Flow sheet data includes vital signs with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/55 to 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yr old woman with traumatic fall and paralysis presents with resp
   failure in setting of bilat pl effusions, Afib w RVR now s/p bilat
   pigtail catheter placements by IP with drainage, small bilat apical
   PTX, and repeat CT shows re expanded lungs with extensive ground glass
   underneath. Yet she lacks fever phlegm or leukocytosis to support
   signifcant active PNA .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 .H/O ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 PLEURAL EFFUSION, ACUTE
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   1. Resp Distress: overall improvement in resp status with drainage of
   effusions down to 2 liters nasal cannula. Post tap underlying lungs
   with extensive GGO- given her prolonged hosp stays and new hypotension
   will Rx for nosocomial PNA with Vanco Levo and gather data. It is
   notable however that the desire to treat is driven by abnomrla CT and
   her relative hypotension not truly a clinical case of cough and phlegm
   so this course will need to be evaluated on a dialy basis. IP had
   queried about BAL but she would need sedation and BP are borderline
   will try for expectortation and if fails can re evaluate later in day
   or early AM.
   2. Hypotension: MAPs drifting down in 50
 has been fluid responsive.
   Likely combination of hypovolemia
 poor pos and known pHTN, we will
   bolus another liter watch CVP and UOP. Could be early sepsis as above
   and as such we will plan for Rx with ABX and pan culture
   3. Bilat pleural effusions: CT in place, persistent apical PTX, could
   be failed of lung to completely re expand.
   4. Severe skin breakdown: wound care consult and meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old woman who presented with respiratory distress after a traumatic fall and paralysis. She has bilateral pleural effusions, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and a history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in her lower extremity. The patient underwent chest tube placement on the right side with 1 liter output, and a multi-lumen catheter was started. She also has small bilateral apical pneumothoraces and diffuse ground glass opacities (GGO) on chest CT. The patient's blood pressure has been low and she has been given 1 liter IV fluids. Repeat chest X-ray shows no change in left-sided pneumothorax, and her hematocrit (HCT) is stable.

24-hour events include the placement of a chest tube on the right side with 1 liter output, initiation of multi-lumen catheter, and a chest CT showing smaller effusions, bilateral small apical pneumothoraces, and diffuse GGO. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.8°C (98.2°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate (HR) of 87 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 100/50 mmHg to 113/66 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of respiratory distress. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a chest tube on the right side with 1 liter output, initiation of multi-lumen, and administration of IV fluids. The patient's blood pressure has been low, and a repeat chest X-ray showed no change in left-sided pneumothorax. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has remained stable.

The patient has a history of allergies to anesthesia, nausea/vomiting, and previous antibiotic use. The patient is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and other medications such as fentanyl. The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged from admission except for cardiovascular hypotension.

Flowsheet data indicates vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a central venous pressure (CVP) within normal range. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,157 mL since 12 AM, output of 2,400 mL including 1,085 mL of urine, and a negative fluid balance of 243 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with 100% oxygen saturation. ABG results are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings are not provided in the progress note. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count,"

","The patient presented with respiratory distress and was found to have a pleural effusion. A chest tube was placed on the right side with minimal output. The patient's blood pressure has been low, so they were given IV fluids and a repeat chest X-ray showed no change in the left-sided pleural effusion. The patient's HCT (hematocrit) remains stable.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity, and impaired skin integrity. They are currently being monitored in the ICU and receiving IV fluids. The patient is on a PO (oral) diet and is receiving prophylaxis for DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and stress ulcers. Their code status is full code, indicating that they should receive all possible measures to save their life in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of pulmonary embolism due to the history of DVT, further deterioration of skin integrity, and potential bleeding complications due to the use of heparin sodium."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis with concern for superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia.  No evidence of obstructive airway disease on
   exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed improvement in pleural
   effusions with bilateral small PTXs, and also multifocal pneumonia.
   Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib w/RVR and diastolic
   dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No preceding PNA or
   pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or empyema.   Pleural
   fluid looks like transudative process. CXR in evening shows apical
   pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail placement).  Urine legionella
   antigen negative.
   - Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital acquired pneumonia
 will give
   10 day course ([**11-13**] to [**11-22**]) since patient afebrile, not producing
   sputum
   - to consider BAL sample if cannot get sputum sample and patient
   clinically worsens
   - blood culture
   -repeat cxr to eval for worsening pneumothorax
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol, hold for hypotension
   -continue to support nutritional status
 encourage PO intake
   -consider stopping flagyl pending culture results
   #Hypotension: Improved from day prior, but still present.  Likely a
   combination of poor PO intake and high output from pigtail catheters.
   -          500 cc NS boluses as needed
   -          Encourage PO intake
   -          Maintenance fluids

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of bilateral lower extremity paralysis, epidural hematoma, and cord compression following a fall. She has a history of DVT, IVC filter placement, diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and anasarca. The patient presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure, large left-sided pleural effusion, and multifocal pneumonia. She is currently on vancomycin and levoquin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and her vital signs include tachypnea, hypotension, and an irregular heart rhythm. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may be due to poor oral intake, high output from pigtail catheters, or other underlying causes. 
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's elevated carbon dioxide levels suggest inadequate ventilation. This could be related to bilateral pleural effusions, associated atelectasis, and concern for superimposed multifocal pneumonia.
3. Pleural effusions: The patient has a large left-sided pleural effusion along with smaller right-sided effusion. These effusions may contribute to her respiratory distress and could be transudative in nature.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin and levoquin. There is concern for super"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis.  No evidence of obstructive
   airways disease on exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed no PT
   but had multifocal pneumonia.  Effusion most likely due to combination
   of Afib w/RVR and diastolic dysfunction as well as poor nutritional
   status.  No preceding PNA or pulmonary mass to support malignant
   effusion or empyema.   Pleural fluid looks like transudative process.
   CXR in evening shows apical pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail
   placement)
   - Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital acquired pneumonia
 will give
   10 day course since patient afebrile, not producing sputum
   - to consider BAL sample if cannot get sputum sample
   - blood culture
   -urine legionella Cx
   -repeat cxr to eval for worsening pneumothorax
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol, hold for hypotension
   -continue to support nutritional status
 encourage PO intake
   #Hypotension: Improved with 2L of NS last night.  Patient with UOP last
   night usually >30cc/hr.  Hypotension likely a combination of poor PO
   intake over last 48 hours, aggressive diuresis at rehab facility, and
   high output from pigtail catheters (R side produced 1L fluid in approx
   10 hours yesterday)
   -          500 cc NS boluses as needed
   -          Encourage PO intake
   -          Maintenance fluids

   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with diabetes mellitus who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis. The patient is overweight and obese, with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates seen on CT scan. She has exudative effusions without evidence of active infection, which are being drained bilaterally. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 94/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is also receiving Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Heparin sodium infusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to impaired chest wall function, possible pneumonia, and evolving pleural effusions.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may have hospital-acquired pneumonia, which requires treatment with antibiotics such as Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl for 7 days.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which need to be managed with chest tubes on suction and coordinated with the interventional pulmonology (IP) service. The left chest tube may be moved to water seal with 50cc in 24 hours if the pneumothorax is stable.
4. Weakness/Immobility: The patient's weakness and immobility require physical therapy to help ambulate and ideally get out of bed.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of stable atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation should be continued.
6. Deep Venous Thrombosis: The patient has a history of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, and systemic anticoagulation with Heparin should be continued.
7. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient requires nutritional and skin care support to address impaired skin integrity.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is recommended for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis with concern for superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia.  No evidence of obstructive airway disease on
   exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed improvement in pleural
   effusions with bilateral small PTXs, and also multifocal pneumonia.
   Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib w/RVR and diastolic
   dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No preceding PNA or
   pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or empyema.   Pleural
   fluid looks like transudative process. CXR in evening shows apical
   pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail placement).  Urine legionella
   antigen negative.
   - Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital acquired pneumonia
 will give
   10 day course ([**11-13**] to [**11-22**]) since patient afebrile, not producing
   sputum
   - to consider BAL sample if cannot get sputum sample and patient
   clinically worsens
   - blood culture
   -repeat cxr to eval for worsening pneumothorax
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol, hold for hypotension
   -continue to support nutritional status
 encourage PO intake
   #Hypotension: Improved from day prior, but still present.  Likely a
   combination of poor PO intake and high output from pigtail catheters.
   -          250 cc NS boluses as needed
   -          Encourage PO intake
   -          Maintenance fluids
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled, but most recent doses
   held due to hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol as allowed by BP
   .
   # Chest tubes/pigtails: Left tube with increased output, IP changed
   back to suction.  Cont. right on suction.
   - f/u CXR to assess for status of effusions and PTXs.
   # Hematocrit drop: hct stable per repeat hct this am, however, hct is
   down since admission.
   -check [**Hospital1 7**] hct.
   -consider stopping heparin if evidence of bleeding
   -guaiac all stools.
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - on heparin gtt
   -d/w IP when to re-start coumadin
   .
   #Anasarca - likely [**1-29**] diastolic chf c/b afib w/rvr as well as poor
   nutritional status.
   -holding lasix secondary to hypotension
   -continue to support nutrition
   .
   #. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Stable
   - continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   .
   #Skin breakdown - she has multiple areas of skin breakdown likely due
   to poor nutritional status and anasarca as well as new paralysis.
   -continue to support nutritional status, appreciate nutrition reccs
   -f/u wound care reccs
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Stable
   - continue fenofibrate and pravastatin
   .
   # h/o C. diff infection
 cont. flagyl through [**11-18**].
   .
   # FEN: diabetic diet; replete lytes prn
   -          continue multivitamin
   -          IVF boluses in 500 cc increments to support BP

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of bilateral lower extremity paralysis following a fall with epidural hematoma and cord compression. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. The patient also has diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Bilateral small pleural effusions with multifocal pneumonia, likely due to AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and diastolic dysfunction, as well as poor nutritional status.
- Apical pneumothorax on the left, which was identified after pigtail catheter placement.
- Urine growing Gram-negative rods (GNRs), possibly E. coli, which is resistant to ciprofloxacin.
- Decreased breath sounds over the left apex.
- Pitting edema bilaterally to the sacrum.
- Multiple areas of skin breakdown, likely due to poor nutritional status and anasarca (generalized edema).
- Hypotension, possibly caused by poor oral intake and high output from pigtail catheters.
- Hematocrit drop since admission, indicating potential bleeding.
- History of DVT and IVC filter placement.
- Anasarca, likely due to diastolic"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo female with bilateral lower extremity paralysis
   s/p fall w/epidural hematoma and cord compression, h/o DVT s/p IVC
   filter, DM2, Afib with large L sided effusion and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.
   .
   #Hypercarbic respiratory failure: most likely due to b/l pleural
   effusions and associated atelectasis with concern for superimposed
   multifocal pneumonia.  No evidence of obstructive airway disease on
   exam to explain her hypercarbia.  CT showed improvement in pleural
   effusions with bilateral small PTXs, and also multifocal pneumonia.
   Effusion most likely due to combination of Afib w/RVR and diastolic
   dysfunction as well as poor nutritional status.  No preceding PNA or
   pulmonary mass to support malignant effusion or empyema.   Pleural
   fluid looks like transudative process. CXR in evening shows apical
   pneumothorax on L (also seen post-pigtail placement).  Urine legionella
   antigen negative.
   - Vancomycin and levoquin for hospital acquired pneumonia
 will give
   10 day course ([**11-13**] to [**11-22**]) since patient afebrile, not producing
   sputum
   - to consider BAL sample if cannot get sputum sample and patient
   clinically worsens
   - blood culture
   -repeat cxr to eval for worsening pneumothorax
   -continue with rate control with metoprolol, hold for hypotension
   -continue to support nutritional status
 encourage PO intake
   -consider stopping flagyl pending culture results
   #Hypotension: Improved from day prior, but still present.  Likely a
   combination of poor PO intake and high output from pigtail catheters.
   -          500 cc NS boluses as needed
   -          Encourage PO intake
   -          Maintenance fluids
   .
   #Afib with RVR - she was started on metoprolol post operatively for
   Afib with RVR.  Currently well rate controlled, but most recent doses
   held due to hypotension.
   -continue metoprolol as allowed by BP
   .
   # Chest tubes/pigtails: Left tube with 50 cc output over 24 hrs
 will
   plan to seal and eventually remove.  Right pigtail with 500 cc output
   over 24 hrs.  Will allow it to continue to drain.
   - f/u CXR to assess for status of effusions and PTXs.
   # Hematocrit drop: hct stable per repeat hct this am, however, hct is
   down since admission.
   -check [**Hospital1 7**] hct.
   -consider stopping heparin if evidence of bleeding
   -guaiac all stools.
   #h/o DVT, s/p IVC filter placement: Patient has a history of L
   popliteal DVT, during her last admisison she had negative LENI's
   however due to concern about restarting coumadin in the setting of
   epidural bleed an IVC filter was placed by IR.  Prior to her discharge
   to rehab she was restarted on coumdain and had an INR of 2.3 on
   admission.
   - on heparin gtt
   -d/w IP when to re-start coumadin
   .
   #Anasarca - likely [**1-29**] diastolic chf c/b afib w/rvr as well as poor
   nutritional status.
   -holding lasix secondary to hypotension
   -continue to support nutrition
   .
   #. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Stable
   - continue glargine and insulin sliding scale
   .
   #Skin breakdown - she has multiple areas of skin breakdown likely due
   to poor nutritional status and anasarca as well as new paralysis.
   -continue to support nutritional status, appreciate nutrition reccs
   -f/u wound care reccs
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia: Stable
   - continue fenofibrate and pravastatin
   .
   # FEN: diabetic diet; replete lytes prn
   -          continue multivitamin
   -          IVF boluses in 500 cc increments to support BP
   #Prophylaxis: wound care, heparin gtt, bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of bilateral lower extremity paralysis due to a fall with epidural hematoma and cord compression, as well as a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement.
- The patient has been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis with concern for superimposed multifocal pneumonia.
- The pleural effusion is most likely a transudative process, and the patient has tested negative for Legionella antigen.
- The patient has been prescribed a 10-day course of vancomycin and levoquin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, with consideration for a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample if unable to obtain sputum sample and if the patient clinically worsens.
- Blood cultures have been taken, and a repeat chest X-ray will be done to evaluate for worsening pneumothorax.
- The patient's hypotension is believed to be caused by poor oral intake and high output from pigtail catheters, for which 500 cc normal saline boluses will be given as needed.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) is being managed with metoprolol, but recent doses were held due to"

   significant and chronic compromise in the setting of baseline
   paralysis.  She has had continued high volume output from chest tubes
   bilaterally
the source of these effusions remains to be defined with
   confidence but it would appear that transudative effusionin the setting
   of low oncotic pressure may well be driving much of the pleural
   effusions presence.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old female admitted with hypoxemic respiratory compromise and bilateral pleural effusions. She has a history of chronic respiratory compromise due to baseline paralysis. The patient has been receiving chest tube drainage bilaterally, with ongoing high volume output. The cause of the pleural effusions is not yet defined, but it appears to be a transudative effusion in the setting of low oncotic pressure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure:
- The patient is currently on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Metronidazole.
- Antibiotic dosing will be modified based on culture results, considering GNR coverage in the urine.
- Repeat urine cultures will be done.

2. Pleural Effusions:
- Right chest tube: 200cc in 6 hours.
- Left Chest Tube: 250cc in 6 hours.
- Chest tube drainage will be monitored.
- Pleuradhesis may be considered if persistent drainage is seen, limiting ventilatory capacities.
- Albumin levels will be rechecked, and nutrition will be addressed.

3. DVT-Known in LE:
- The patient is on heparin gtt.
- Dosing will transition back to Coumadin.
