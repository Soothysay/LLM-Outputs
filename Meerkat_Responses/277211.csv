","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various procedures including paracentesis, multi-lumen catheter placement, arterial line placement, and invasive ventilation. The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, pantoprazole (Protonix), and other medications as part of their ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications due to invasive ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Infection-related complications due to immunosuppression and prolonged hospital stay, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
3. Hemodynamic instability due to hypovolemia or sepsis, which may require interventions such as fluid resuscitation or vasopressor support.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy due to liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension, which can manifest as altered mental status or confusion.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and hypercoagulable state.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding or variceal hemorrhage due to portal hypertension and cirrhosis.
7. Renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension or hepatorenal syndrome.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 y/o man with PMH notable for alcoholic cirrhosis admitted
   with abdominal pain/distension in setting of SMV thrombus and now
   transferred to MICU with hypotension/bradycardia and altered mental
   status.
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: Improved after dosing of glucagon and likely
   related to decreased clearance of nadolol in setting of worsening renal
   failure. With hematocrit drop, also could be due to volume depletion
   with blood loss. Concern also for sepsis, but source unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 133**]
   investigate abdomen as potential source with CT abdomen/pelvis.
   Paracentesis on arrival to ICU not consistent with SBP.
   - redose glucagon prn, could add drip
   - repeat lactate once bps improved
   - hold all beta blockade
   - CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for bleeding source or ? colitis
   - follow blood cultures, paracentesis cultures
   .
   # Altered mental status: Could be related to hypotension or new
   infection (intraabdominal versus bacteremia). Appears to have been
   taking lactulose for past few days but hepatic encephalopathy certainly
   on the differential.
   - CT head without contrast
   - follow studies for SBP
   - hold lactulose for now (no NG tube due to recent banding of varices)
   - repeat RUQ ultrasound to eval for portal vein thrombosis
   .
   # Anemia: Hct down 10 points over 24 hours with hypotension. Has known
   varices with banding several days ago.
   - check hemolysis labs, Coombs test
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - 2 U PRBCs on arrival to the ICU
   - post-transfusion hct this afternoon
   - guaiac stools
   - CT abdomen/pelvis to eval for hemoperitoneum
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. Urine lytes
   this morning with urine sodium < 10.
   - albumin 100 g daily X 2 days
   - consider midodrine/octreotide
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improving since admission. Off of diuretics. Continue
   to trend.
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD now 31 with today's labs. Recent SMV
   thrombosis on scan, with heparin gtt as described above, which is now
   off.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue lactulose, may need NG tube for dosing
   - RUQ ultrasound and CT abd/pelvis as above
   .
   # Type 2 DM: sliding scale insulin. while not eating, will need some
   lantus coverage (1/2 dose of 45 units given while eating).
   .
   # Hypertension: hold all antihypertensives for now
   .
   # COPD: continue albuterol prn
   .
   # FEN: npo for now, lyte repletion prn
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots, ppi, can use lactulose prn
   .
   # CODE: full, confirmed with wife who is hcp
   .
   # COMM: With patient and his wife, [**Name (NI) 96**]. [**Numeric Identifier 4502**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain and distension due to a superior mesenteric vein thrombus. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with hypotension, bradycardia, and altered mental status. There are concerns for sepsis, hypovolemia, and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's liver function is worsening, as indicated by the rising MELD score. Other conditions include type 2 diabetes, hypertension, COPD, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Bradycardia: The patient's low blood pressure and slow heart rate may indicate a decreased cardiac output or volume depletion. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, including investigating the abdomen as a potential source of bleeding.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status changes could be related to hypotension, new infection, or hepatic encephalopathy. A CT head without contrast should be done to rule out any other causes.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped significantly over the past 24 hours. This could be due to blood loss or hemolysis. Additional lab tests, such as hemolysis labs and Coombs test, should be conducted.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function raises concerns for hepatorenal syndrome."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 y/o man with PMH notable for alcoholic cirrhosis admitted
   with abdominal pain/distension in setting of SMV thrombus and now
   transferred to MICU with hypotension/bradycardia and altered mental
   status.
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: Improved after dosing of glucagon and likely
   related to decreased clearance of nadolol in setting of worsening renal
   failure. With hematocrit drop, also could be due to volume depletion
   with blood loss. Concern also for sepsis, but source unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 133**]
   investigate abdomen as potential source with CT abdomen/pelvis.
   Paracentesis on arrival to ICU not consistent with SBP.
   - redose glucagon prn, could add drip
   - repeat lactate once bps improved
   - hold all beta blockade
   - CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for bleeding source or ? colitis
   - follow blood cultures, paracentesis cultures
   .
   # Altered mental status: Could be related to hypotension or new
   infection (intraabdominal versus bacteremia). Appears to have been
   taking lactulose for past few days but hepatic encephalopathy certainly
   on the differential.
   - CT head without contrast
   - follow studies for SBP
   - hold lactulose for now (no NG tube due to recent banding of varices)
   - repeat RUQ ultrasound to eval for portal vein thrombosis
   .
   # Anemia: Hct down 10 points over 24 hours with hypotension. Has known
   varices with banding several days ago.
   - check hemolysis labs, Coombs test
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - 2 U PRBCs on arrival to the ICU
   - post-transfusion hct this afternoon
   - guaiac stools
   - CT abdomen/pelvis to eval for hemoperitoneum
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. Urine lytes
   this morning with urine sodium < 10.
   - albumin 100 g daily X 2 days
   - consider midodrine/octreotide
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improving since admission. Off of diuretics. Continue
   to trend.
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD now 31 with today's labs. Recent SMV
   thrombosis on scan, with heparin gtt as described above, which is now
   off.
   - trend LFTs
   - continue lactulose, may need NG tube for dosing
   - RUQ ultrasound and CT abd/pelvis as above
   .
   # Type 2 DM: sliding scale insulin. while not eating, will need some
   lantus coverage (1/2 dose of 45 units given while eating).
   .
   # Hypertension: hold all antihypertensives for now
   .
   # COPD: continue albuterol prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, admitted for abdominal pain and distension due to superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis. He is now in the ICU with hypotension, bradycardia, and altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension/bradycardia, altered mental status, anemia, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, alcoholic cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and malnutrition.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypotension/bradycardia: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may be related to decreased clearance of nadolol in the setting of worsening renal failure or volume depletion with blood loss. There is also a concern for sepsis, but the source is unclear. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause and provide appropriate treatment.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be related to hypotension or a new infection (intraabdominal versus bacteremia). Hepatic encephalopathy is also on the differential. A CT head without contrast has been ordered, and blood cultures and paracentesis cultures are being followed.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped significantly over 24 hours, which may be"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 y/o man with PMH notable for alcoholic cirrhosis admitted
   with abdominal pain/distension in setting of SMV thrombus and now
   transferred to MICU with hypotension/bradycardia and altered mental
   status.
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: Improved after dosing of glucagon and likely
   related to decreased clearance of nadolol in setting of worsening renal
   failure. With hematocrit drop, also could be due to volume depletion
   with blood loss. Concern also for sepsis, but source unclear.
   Investigated abdomen as potential source with CT abdomen/pelvis, no
   evidence of hemoperiteneum. Paracentesis on arrival to ICU not
   consistent with SBP.
   - HR stable off glucagons
   - repeat lactate 1.3
   - hold all beta blockade
   - CT abdomen/pelvis concerning of SMV veinous congestion. Bowel
   necresis unlikely with downtrending lactate and stable BP.
   - follow blood cultures, paracentesis cultures
   .
   # Altered mental status: Could be related to hypotension or new
   infection (intraabdominal versus bacteremia). Appears to have been
   taking lactulose for past few days but hepatic encephalopathy also
   likely
   - CT head without contrast without evidence of hemmorhage
   - follow studies for para, no evidence of SBP
   - hold lactulose for now (no NG tube due to recent banding of varices).
   Can tolerate encephalopathy given intubated. Will talk with liver
   regaurding visualized placement of NG so can give lactulose /
   decompress gas.
   -avoid excessive versed as likely to clear slowly and clear the pt
   slowly
   .
   # Anemia: Hct down 10 points over 24 hours with hypotension no obvious
   GI bleed. No hemoperituneum.. Has known varices with banding several
   days ago.
   - check hemolysis labs, Coombs test -> hapto low, difficult to
   interperate given transfusion
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - s/p 2 U PRBCs on arrival to the ICU
   - post-transfusion hct stable
   - guaiac stools
   - CT abdomen/pelvis  without evidence of  hemoperitoneum
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. Urine lytes
   this morning with urine sodium < 10.
   - albumin 100 g daily X 2 days
   - consider midodrine/octreotide, originially held given possible ileus
   to readdress with GI.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improving since admission. Off of diuretics. Continue
   to trend.
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD now 31 with yesterdays labs. Recent SMV
   thrombosis on scan, with heparin gtt as described above, which is now
   off.
   - trend LFTs, bili uptrending
   - holding  lactulose, may need NG tube for dosing
   - RUQ ultrasound and CT abd/pelvis as above. RUQ without portal vein
   thobosis. SMV clot close to portal vein. A clot in portal vein would
   remove pt from consideration for transplant. Given this is extremely
   important to pt survival will talk with GI regaurding starting heparin
   gtt agai
   .
   # Type 2 DM: sliding scale insulin. while not eating, will need some
   lantus coverage (1/2 dose of 45 units given while eating).
   .
   # Hypertension: hold all antihypertensives for now
   .
   # COPD: continue albuterol prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who was admitted with abdominal pain and distension in the setting of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombus. He is now in the ICU with hypotension, bradycardia, and altered mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/bradycardia: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia could be due to decreased clearance of nadolol in the setting of worsening renal failure, volume depletion with blood loss, or sepsis. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be related to hypotension or a new infection (intraabdominal versus bacteremia). Hepatic encephalopathy is also likely given his history of alcoholic cirrhosis. Further evaluation and management should include ruling out new infections and addressing potential causes of hepatic encephalopathy.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped significantly over 24 hours without obvious GI bleed. This could be due to hemolysis or blood loss. Additional investigations such as hemolysis labs and Coombs test are required to determine the cause.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, likely hepatorenal syndrome given his cirrhosis. Albumin infusions and consideration of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who was admitted with abdominal pain and distension due to superior mesenteric vein (SMV) thrombosis. He is now in the ICU with hypotension/bradycardia, altered mental status, anemia, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and has undergone paracentesis and arterial line placement. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 134/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, total bilirubin, and lactate levels, as well as low hemoglobin, hematocrit, sodium, potassium, and albumin levels. Imaging studies reveal SMV thrombosis and no evidence of hemorrhage in the head or abdomen. The patient's condition is complicated by potential hypotension/bradycardia, altered mental status, anemia, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, and alcoholic cirrhosis with a MELD score of 31.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient experienced an unplanned extubation but was successfully reintubated without incident. A paracentesis was performed, which was negative for SBP, and the patient showed increased abdominal distention with no rise in lactate. The patient's renal function worsened, with a creatinine level of 3.7. 

The patient is currently on several medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole). The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/45 to 144/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 623 mL, respiratory rate of 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 22. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 72 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 85 to 108 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels have been trending upward. 

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic anemia, and altered mental status. The patient is at risk for aspiration due to an inability to protect his airway. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, respiratory infections due to mechanical ventilation, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, and hepatic encephalopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 y/o man with PMH notable for alcoholic cirrhosis admitted
   with abdominal pain/distension in setting of SMV thrombus and now
   transferred to MICU with hypotension/bradycardia and altered mental
   status.
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: Improved after dosing of glucagon and likely
   related to decreased clearance of nadolol in setting of worsening renal
   failure. With hematocrit drop, also could be due to volume depletion
   with blood loss. Concern also for sepsis, but source unclear.
   Investigated abdomen as potential source with CT abdomen/pelvis, no
   evidence of hemoperiteneum. Paracentesis on arrival to ICU not
   consistent with SBP.
   - HR stable off glucagons
   - repeat lactate 1.3
   - hold all beta blockade
   - CT abdomen/pelvis concerning of SMV veinous congestion. Bowel
   necresis unlikely with downtrending lactate and stable BP.
   - follow blood cultures, paracentesis cultures
   .
   # Altered mental status: Could be related to hypotension or new
   infection (intraabdominal versus bacteremia). Appears to have been
   taking lactulose for past few days but hepatic encephalopathy also
   likely
   - CT head without contrast without evidence of hemmorhage
   - follow studies for para, no evidence of SBP
   - hold lactulose for now (no NG tube due to recent banding of varices).
   Can tolerate encephalopathy given intubated. Will talk with liver
   regaurding visualized placement of NG so can give lactulose /
   decompress gas.
   -avoid excessive versed as likely to clear slowly and clear the pt
   slowly
   .
   # Anemia: Hct down 10 points over 24 hours with hypotension no obvious
   GI bleed. No hemoperituneum.. Has known varices with banding several
   days ago.
   - check hemolysis labs, Coombs test -> hapto low, difficult to
   interperate given transfusion
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - s/p 2 U PRBCs on arrival to the ICU
   - post-transfusion hct stable
   - guaiac stools
   - CT abdomen/pelvis  without evidence of  hemoperitoneum
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. Urine lytes
   this morning with urine sodium < 10.
   - albumin 100 g daily X 2 days
   - consider midodrine/octreotide, originially held given possible ileus
   to readdress with GI.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improving since admission. Off of diuretics. Continue
   to trend.
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD now 31 with yesterdays labs. Recent SMV
   thrombosis on scan, with heparin gtt as described above, which is now
   off.
   - trend LFTs, bili uptrending
   - holding  lactulose, may need NG tube for dosing
   - RUQ ultrasound and CT abd/pelvis as above. RUQ without portal vein
   thobosis. SMV clot close to portal vein. A clot in portal vein would
   remove pt from consideration for transplant. Given this is extremely
   important to pt survival will talk with GI regaurding starting heparin
   gtt agai
   .
   # Type 2 DM: sliding scale insulin. while not eating, will need some
   lantus coverage (1/2 dose of 45 units given while eating).
   .
   # Hypertension: hold all antihypertensives for now
   .
   # COPD: continue albuterol prn
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis. He was admitted with abdominal pain and distension due to a superior mesenteric vein thrombus. The patient was then transferred to the ICU for hypotension, bradycardia, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Bradycardia: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia have improved after glucagon administration. Possible causes include decreased clearance of nadolol in the setting of worsening renal failure, volume depletion with blood loss, or sepsis. Further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be related to hypotension or a new infection (intraabdominal versus bacteremia). Hepatic encephalopathy is also likely, considering the patient's history of cirrhosis. CT head without contrast showed no evidence of hemorrhage, and blood cultures have been followed. Lactulose has been temporarily held due to recent banding of varices, but it may need to be restarted with NG tube placement for decompression.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased by 10 points over 24 hours with hypotension but no obvious GI bleed. Known varices with recent banding could be a contributing factor. Further evaluation is necessary, including checking hemolysis labs"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 68 y/o man with PMH notable for alcoholic cirrhosis admitted
   with abdominal pain/distension in setting of SMV thrombus and now
   transferred to MICU with hypotension/bradycardia and altered mental
   status, with possible liver transplant this afternoon.
   .
   # Hypotension/bradycardia: Improved after dosing of glucagon and likely
   related to decreased clearance of nadolol in setting of worsening renal
   failure. With hematocrit drop, also could be due to volume depletion
   with blood loss. Concern also for sepsis, but source unclear.
   Investigated abdomen as potential source with CT abdomen/pelvis, no
   evidence of hemoperiteneum. Paracentesis on arrival to ICU not
   consistent with SBP.
   - HR stable off glucagons
   - repeat lactate 1.3
   - hold all beta blockade
   - CT abdomen/pelvis concerning of SMV veinous congestion. Bowel
   necresis unlikely with downtrending lactate and stable BP.
   - follow blood cultures, paracentesis cultures
   - on empiric abx
   .
   # Altered mental status: Could be related to hypotension or new
   infection (intraabdominal versus bacteremia). Appears to have been
   taking lactulose for past few days but hepatic encephalopathy also
   likely
   - CT head without contrast without evidence of hemmorhage
   - follow studies for para, no evidence of SBP
   - hold lactulose for now (no NG tube due to recent banding of varices).
   Can tolerate encephalopathy given intubated. Will talk with liver
   regaurding visualized placement of NG so can give lactulose /
   decompress gas.
   -avoid excessive versed as likely to clear slowly
   - consider MR head for follow up of CT
   .
   # Anemia: Hct down 10 points over 24 hours with hypotension no obvious
   GI bleed. No hemoperituneum.. Has known varices with banding several
   days ago.
   - check hemolysis labs, Coombs test -> hapto low, difficult to
   interperate given transfusion
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - s/p 2 U PRBCs on arrival to the ICU
   - post-transfusion hct stable
   - guaiac stools
   - CT abdomen/pelvis  without evidence of  hemoperitoneum
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. Urine lytes
   with urine sodium < 10.
   - albumin 100 g daily X 2 days
   - consider midodrine/octreotide, originially held given possible ileus
   to readdress with GI.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Improving since admission. Off of diuretics. Continue
   to trend.
   .
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD low 30s. Recent SMV thrombosis on scan,
   with heparin gtt as described above, which is now off.
   - trend LFTs, bili uptrending
   - holding  lactulose, but will need via NGT, no BMs last several days
   - RUQ ultrasound and CT abd/pelvis as above. RUQ without portal vein
   thobosis. SMV clot close to portal vein. A clot in portal vein would
   remove pt from consideration for transplant. Given this is extremely
   important to pt survival will talk with GI regaurding starting heparin
   gtt agai
   .
   # Type 2 DM: sliding scale insulin. while not eating, will need some
   lantus coverage (1/2 dose of 45 units given while eating).
   .
   # Hypertension: hold all antihypertensives for now
   .
   # COPD: continue albuterol prn
   .
   # FEN: npo for now, lyte repletion prn. Discuss NG tube with liver
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots, ppi,
   # Acess RIJ, PIV

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who was admitted with abdominal pain and distension in the setting of a superior mesenteric vein thrombus. He has been transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypotension, bradycardia, and altered mental status. The patient is planned for liver transplantation this afternoon.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension/Bradycardia: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia are likely related to decreased clearance of nadolol in the setting of worsening renal failure. However, the cause could also be due to volume depletion with blood loss or sepsis. Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be related to hypotension or a new infection (intra-abdominal versus bacteremia). Hepatic encephalopathy is also likely, especially since the patient has been taking lactulose for the past few days. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status closely and consider interventions such as placing a nasogastric tube to decompress gas and administer lactulose.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped significantly over 24 hours, which could be due to blood loss or hemolysis. Given the patient's known varices and recent banding, there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia and appropriate interventions.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function is concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. Albumin infusions and consideration of midodrine/octreotide may be indicated to improve renal function.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is improving since admission and should be continued to be trended. Discontinuation of diuretics may be appropriate.

6. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient's MELD score is low 30s, indicating a need for liver transplantation evaluation. The recent SMV thrombosis is a concern, but the patient is not removed from consideration for transplant.

7. Type 2 DM: The patient requires sliding scale insulin due to his diabetes. Coverage for glucose control should be provided, especially while the patient is not eating.

8. Hypertension: All antihypertensives should be held at this time.

9. COPD: Albuterol should be administered as needed for respiratory symptoms.

10. FEN (nothing by mouth): The patient is currently on NPO status, and discussions regarding nasogastric tube placement should be considered.

11. PPx (prophylaxis): Prophylactic measures such as pneumoboots and PPI should be considered.

12. Access: The patient has an existing right internal"
