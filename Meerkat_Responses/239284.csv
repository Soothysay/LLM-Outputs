   Assessment and Plan
   88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with
   syncope and found to have 2:1 AV block.  .
   .
   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - EKG in am
   - will d/w EP in am re ? pacer as this appears to be symptomatic
   bradycardia a/w 2nd degree AV block.
   .
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Given that
   ischemia can lead to AV block, will continue cycle CE.
   - hold atenolol
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear but perhaps some mild pulmonary congestion on exam.
   Will keep I/O even for now but consider lasix if pulm edema worsens.
   Suspect cardiac output will improve with increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Hold ACE in
   setting of renal dysfunction and try hydral prn.  Hold atenolol w
   bradycardia.  Treat pain with morphine.  Tolerate SBP 170s
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.5 with GFR 35.  Will hold
   ACE tonight and keep I/O even.  Check urine lytes
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: statin
   .
   Depression: fluoxetine 20 but hold ativan.  Monitor for delirium
   - check u/a to risk assess for delirium
   .
   Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine 75.  Will check TSH given the
   bradycardia.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now until stabilizes
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SQH
   -Pain management with morphine IV and tylenol PO
   -Bowel regimen with senna/colace

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with syncope and was found to have a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 172/56 to 125/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on several medications including atenolol, lisinopril, levothyroxine, fluoxetine, and statin. She has been receiving treatment for hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low (49 bpm), which can be a result of her medication (atenolol) and the AV block. If the bradycardia worsens, the patient may require atropine or a pacemaker.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating between 172/56 and 125/53 mmHg. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure that her blood pressure remains within a stable range.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.1-1.3, and now it has increased to 1.5 with a decreased glomerular filtration rate"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with syncope and was found to have a 2:1 AV block. The patient is currently experiencing bradycardia and is being managed with atropine and pacing pads at the bedside. A pacemaker is planned for Monday if the bradycardia persists. The patient has euvolemic status with an EF of 55% and grade I diastolic dysfunction. She also has mild aortic stenosis. The patient had a traumatic fall resulting in rib pain, but no fractures or effusions were seen on the chest X-ray. The patient's blood pressure was uncontrolled overnight, so lisinopril has been restarted. The patient's renal function has returned to baseline. Other conditions such as depression, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism are being managed with appropriate medications. The patient is on a cardiac/low Na diet, and prophylaxis for DVT and pain management are in place. The patient is currently in the CCU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening bradycardia: The patient's current bradycardia could potentially worsen, leading to further decrease in heart rate and cardiac output.
2. Ischemia: Although the EKG is currently unchanged, there is still a possibility of underlying ischemia contributing to the AV block"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with syncope and was found to have a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 172/56 mmHg to 125/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is on several medications including a beta-blocker, which may be contributing to her bradycardia. She also has a history of mild aortic stenosis and diastolic dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently low, indicating bradycardia. This can potentially lead to decreased cardiac output and inadequate perfusion of vital organs.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are significantly below normal, which could compromise organ perfusion and lead to hypoperfusion syndrome or shock.
3. Ischemia: Despite the absence of ischemic changes on the EKG, the patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia increases her risk for ischemic events such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance with a total out"

 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 INEFFECTIVE COPING
   88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with
   syncope and found to have 2:1 AV block.  .
   .
   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - EKG in am
   - will d/w EP in am re ? pacer as this appears to be symptomatic
   bradycardia a/w 2nd degree AV block.
   .
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Given that
   ischemia can lead to AV block, will continue cycle CE.
   - hold atenolol
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear but perhaps some mild pulmonary congestion on exam.
   Will keep I/O even for now but consider lasix if pulm edema worsens.
   Suspect cardiac output will improve with increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Hold ACE in
   setting of renal dysfunction and try hydral prn.  Hold atenolol w
   bradycardia.  Treat pain with morphine.  Tolerate SBP 170s
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.5 with GFR 35.  Will hold
   ACE tonight and keep I/O even.  Check urine lytes
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: statin
   .
   Depression: fluoxetine 20 but hold ativan.  Monitor for delirium
   - check u/a to risk assess for delirium
   .
   Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine 75.  Will check TSH given the
   bradycardia.

","The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with syncope and was found to have a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 43 bpm, blood pressure of 160/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient is currently receiving levothyroxine 88 mcg for hypothyroidism, atenolol for hypertension, lisinopril, and a statin for hyperlipidemia. She is also taking fluoxetine 20 mg for depression but holding ativan. Her pain is being managed with morphine IV and tylenol PO.

The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with an increase in baseline creatinine from 1.1-1.3 to 1.5 and a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 35. Her electrolytes show a potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L and a sodium level of 140 mEq/L.

The patient has delirium and confusion, which is likely due to multiple factors including her age, underlying medical conditions, and recent changes in medication. There is no evidence of ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with syncope and found to have a 2:1 AV block. The patient is currently experiencing delirium/confusion, acute and chronic pain, hypertension, ineffective coping, and acute renal failure.

The vital signs indicate that the patient has a temperature of 36.4Â°C, a heart rate of 43 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/62 mmHg to 203/121 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The physical examination shows a second-degree AV block - Mobitz II, and the patient is on multiple medications including atenolol, lisinopril, levothyroxine, fluoxetine, and morphine.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 249 K/uL, a low platelet count of 112 mg/dL, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range, and her kidney function is compromised with a GFR of 35.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient's delirium/confusion may be related to her medications and renal dysfunction. Pain control is a priority, and the patient's hypertension needs to be managed while holding ACE inhibitors due to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with syncope and found to have a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F), heart rate of 43 beats per minute (bpm) with a second-degree AV block Mobitz II, blood pressure ranging from 160/62 to 203/121 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. 

The patient has been started on various medications, including zyprexa for agitation, levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and atenolol for hypertension, which may need to be held due to bradycardia. 

The physical examination reveals that the patient is somewhat tangential in thought process, has a dry mouth, bilateral carotid bruits, and soft abdomen with no tenderness. 

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels and a slightly low potassium level. 

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has delirium, pain control issues, hypertension, ineffective coping, and other underlying conditions such as hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and potential coronary artery disease. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening bradyc"

 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 INEFFECTIVE COPING
   88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with
   syncope and found to have 2:1 AV block.  .
   .
   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - EKG in am
   - will d/w EP in am re ? pacer as this appears to be symptomatic
   bradycardia a/w 2nd degree AV block.
   .
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Given that
   ischemia can lead to AV block, will continue cycle CE.
   - hold atenolol
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear but perhaps some mild pulmonary congestion on exam.
   Will keep I/O even for now but consider lasix if pulm edema worsens.
   Suspect cardiac output will improve with increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Hold ACE in
   setting of renal dysfunction and try hydral prn.  Hold atenolol w
   bradycardia.  Treat pain with morphine.  Tolerate SBP 170s
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.5 with GFR 35.  Will hold
   ACE tonight and keep I/O even.  Check urine lytes
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: statin
   .
   Depression: fluoxetine 20 but hold ativan.  Monitor for delirium
   - check u/a to risk assess for delirium
   .
   Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine 75.  Will check TSH given the
   bradycardia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with syncope and found to have a 2:1 AV block.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.2 C (97.1 F)
- Heart Rate: 43 bpm (39 - 68 bpm)

- Respiratory Rate: 21 breaths per minute (11 - 25 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen Saturation: 97% on nasal cannula

The patient has a second-degree AV block - Mobitz type II, which can present with a 2:1 block. Vagal maneuvers or atropine may be performed to evaluate for block at the AV node or below. The etiology of the AV block is likely from atenolol (a beta-blocker) and worsening renal function. Other potential causes include ischemic heart disease, increased vagal tone, or calcification of the mitral valve.

The patient is currently stable, but will be monitored for hemodynamic instability. If the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, an electrophysiologist (EP) will be contacted urgently. Atropine and hospital pads are at the bedside. Atenolol will be held, and more glucagon"

   atenolol as above. HTN be partially due to agitation.
   - Continue Lisinopril 20 mg daily
   - Agitation as below
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.1. Likely due to decreased
   CO and forward flow.
   - Trend Cr and lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
   .
   Depression/Delerium: On SSRI. Required haldol for agitation yesterday
   and now somnolent. Delirium likely due to not sleeping over last 72 hrs
   in house. [**Month (only) 11**] also be exacerbated by SSRI.  U cx ngtd and afebrile.
   - Continue Haldol prn for agitation. Continue to monitor for worsening
   QTc
   - Hold fluoxetine for now

   Assessment and Plan
   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - pacer to be placed Mon as this appears to be symptomatic bradycardia
   a/w 2nd degree AV block.
   - In anticipation of pacer on Mon, NPO after midnight on Sunday night
   and ensure left PIV
   .
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Given that
   ischemia can lead to AV block, will continue cycle CE.
   - hold atenolol
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear but perhaps some mild pulmonary congestion on exam.
   Will keep I/O even for now but consider lasix if pulm edema worsens.
   Suspect cardiac output will improve with increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Hold ACE in
   setting of renal dysfunction and try hydral prn.  Hold atenolol w
   bradycardia.  Treat pain with morphine.  Tolerate SBP 170s
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.5 with GFR 35.  Will hold
   ACE tonight and keep I/O even.  Check urine lytes
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: statin
   .
   Depression: fluoxetine 20 but hold ativan.  Monitor for delirium
   - check u/a to risk assess for delirium
   .
   Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine 75.  Will check TSH given the
   bradycardia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of bradycardia. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, ischemic heart disease, hypothyroidism, depression, and hyperlipidemia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been admitted for symptomatic bradycardia associated with a second-degree AV block. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/23 mmHg to 209/157 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals a somewhat tangential thought process, dry mucous membranes, bilateral chest pain, bradycardia, irregular rhythm, and positive bowel sounds.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening renal function: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible renal dysfunction. It is important to monitor kidney function and adjust medication dosages accordingly.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is below the normal range, which can lead to inadequate cardiac output and reduced perfusion to vital organs. Continuous monitoring and intervention, such as atropine administration, may be necessary to maintain an adequate heart rate.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly low at times, indicating possible hypotension. This could compromise tissue perfusion and organ function. Close monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of depression, hypothyroidism, who presented with syncope and was found to have a newly diagnosed 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. She underwent placement of a Sensia SEDR01 dual-chamber pacer and experienced hypotension during the procedure, which was treated with atropine. Her TTE did not reveal pericardial effusion, and her hypotension was felt to be vagal in nature. She also had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that resolved without intervention. The patient continues to be confused and delirious. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and cephalexin. She has a fever and an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate cultures should be obtained.

2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of Mobitz type I or II AV block and recently experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. It is important to monitor her heart rhythm and ensure that her pacemaker is functioning properly.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.1-1.3, and now it has increased to 1.2. This may be due to decreased cardiac output and forward flow. Ren"

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a medical history of depression, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She presented with syncope and was found to have a newly diagnosed 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block, for which she received a Sensia SEDR01 dual-chamber pacer. During the procedure, she experienced hypotension, which responded to atropine administration.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.8Â°F), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 135/64 mmHg to 140s, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on mechanical ventilation and her ABG results are as follows: pH: 7.22, PaCO2: 45 mmHg, and HCO3-: 24 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is arousable, oriented x1 (person), confused, and disoriented. She has bilateral chest crepitations in the anterior fields, regular rhythm with a 2:1 AV block, no peripheral edema, and her extremities are warm and well-perfused.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7-11.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 35.0-38.2 g/dL, platelet count of 243-262 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.1-1.2 mg/dL, troponin-T level of <0.01 ng/mL, and electrolyte imbalances such as sodium (Na+) of 107-142 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 2.2-4.4 mEq/L, and chloride (Cl-) of 22-27 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, vancomycin, ceflex, Tylenol for pain control, and lisinopril for hypertension. She is also on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring of vital signs, heart rhythm, and laboratory values. She is being treated for delirium with haloperidol and her SSRI (fluoxetine) has been discontinued. Pain management is provided with Tylenol. A portable chest X-ray will be obtained, and she will be started on ceflex for infection prophylaxis. The plan is to continue lasix if pulmonary edema worsens, and consider repeat chest X-ray in 12 days to reassess for rib fracture.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening delirium, hypotension, infection, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrhythmias."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU for evaluation of delirium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/64 mmHg to 162/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and temperature within normal range. The patient has a history of fluoxetine use, which was discontinued due to concern for exacerbating delirium. The patient underwent placement of a Sensia SEDR01 dual chamber pacer and experienced hypotension during the procedure, requiring atropine administration. The patient's pericardial effusion was assessed through TTE, which showed no evidence of effusion. The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response resolved without intervention. The patient received vancomycin and cephalexin as per antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations. Code status was reversed for the procedure for 24 hours to full code. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. The patient's recent laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct levels, normal platelet count, and normal glucose levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient is currently on various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and is being closely monitored in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo F with Depression, Hypothyroidism p/w syncope and found to have
   newly diagnosed 2:1 av block now awaiting pacemaker.
   .
   RHYTHM:  Pt had pacer placed yesterday, pt was hypotensive (SBP 50
   during procedure, likely vagal. TTE did not show pericardial effusion.
   Receiced bous. Pt [**Name (NI) 5118**] and in the 70-80
s. Pt received vanco x1.
   Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Atropine testing
   nondiagnostic by EP over the weekend. ROMI complete so unlikely
   ischemic in etiology, although 40% new 2:1 av block can be ischemic in
   origin.
   - will start keflex today x3 days
   - portable CXR this AM, PA/Lat when on the floor
   - pain control with Tylenol (holding narc given delirium)
   - add back BB?
   ..
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - hold atenolol given av block
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear on exam.  Will keep I/O even for now but consider
   lasix if pulm edema worsens.  Suspect cardiac output will improve with
   increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   - Consider repeat CXR in [**12-31**] days to reassess for rib fx
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Holding
   atenolol as above. HTN be partially due to agitation.
   - Continue Lisinopril 20 mg daily
   - Agitation as below
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.1. Likely due to decreased
   CO and forward flow.
   - Trend Cr and lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
   .
   Depression/Delerium: SSRI d/c. Has not required haldol overnight. Still
   confused Delirium likely due to not sleeping over last 72 hrs in house.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also be exacerbated by SSRI.  U cx ngtd and afebrile.
   - Continue Haldol prn for agitation. Continue to monitor for worsening
   QTc
   - Hold fluoxetine for now
   - follow urine cx
   .
   Hypothyroidism:  On levothyroxine 75.  TSH elevated at 10 which may
   indicated patient could use uptitration of synthroid.
   -          Will defer titration of synthroid to outpatient providers
   -          .
   .
   Coagulopathy: Newly found elevated PTT today. [**Month (only) 11**] be lab error or could
   be having systemic absorption of Heparin.
   - Repeat PTT and Hct. If PTT elevated, will consider d/c heparin for
   pneumoboots
   .

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of depression and hypothyroidism who presented with syncope and was found to have a newly diagnosed 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. The patient underwent placement of a Sensia SEDR01 dual chamber pacer, but experienced hypotension during the procedure, which was felt to be vagal in nature. An echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal pericardial effusion, and the patient's blood pressure improved with the administration of IV fluids.

The patient's code status was reversed to full code for the procedure but will be returned to do not resuscitate (DNR) status after 24 hours. The patient's allergies are unknown, and she has no known drug allergies. Her last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on [**2174-5-31**] at 05:25 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 135/64 to 162/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is ventricular paced, and her fluid balance shows an intake of 1,180 mL and output of 340 mL, resulting in a balance of 614 mL.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.7"
