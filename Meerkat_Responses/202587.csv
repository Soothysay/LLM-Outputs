","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of [Location (un) 2455] syndrome, multiple surgeries, and resultant short gut syndrome on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since [2123]. She presents with sepsis, suspicion of septic emboli, acute renal failure, septic shock, pain control, and transaminitis. The patient has a long history of line-associated infections and previous negative [Year (4 digits)] during last admission but has not had a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) yet. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. Immediate treatment is required to manage the infection and prevent further complications.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is also experiencing septic shock, characterized by hypotension and high lactate levels. This indicates inadequate blood flow and oxygen supply to vital organs, increasing the risk of organ failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and there are concerns about acute renal failure. This can be caused by septic emboli, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or interstitial nephritis. Proper fluid management and medication adjustments are necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
4. Septic Emboli: Given the"

","The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of multiple surgeries and resultant short gut syndrome on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since 2123. She presents with sepsis and suspicion of septic emboli. 

The patient has several medical complications including renal failure, septic shock, pain control, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. She also has a history of line-associated infections and clotted veins. 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated lactate level, indicating septic shock. Her laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows a small amount of free fluid in Morrison's pouch and a prominent common bile duct measuring 9mm. 

The patient's past medical history includes aspiration events at home and previous hospitalizations. She has not had a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) done yet. 

The plan includes following up on blood cultures, continuing antibiotics, and adjusting fluid and medication management. The patient's lines should be monitored for potential complications. A repeat TEE is recommended, and the patient's TPN should be held. 

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of gut resections and currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). She presented with hypotension and new word-finding difficulties, along with blue toes and nausea. The patient has a history of multiple allergies and is currently on several antibiotics. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient has been experiencing transient episodes of hypotension responsive to intravenous fluid boluses.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to recurrent line infections and bacteremia with Gram-negative rods (GNRs). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated while awaiting specific identification.
2. Septic emboli: The patient has evidence of septic emboli to the brain, as indicated by hypodense regions on the head CT scan. Further imaging, such as an echocardiogram or transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), may be required to assess for possible endocarditis.
3. Pneumonia: There is a possibility of pneumonia due to decreased breath sounds at the right base and the presence of hypoxia.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of previous pulmonary embolisms, and there is a risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome, short gut syndrome, and multiple surgeries. She is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a long history of line-associated infections. The patient presents with sepsis and suspicion of septic emboli. She is hypotensive with 18% bandemia and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension, bandemia, and elevated lactate levels suggest septic shock. Immediate management should include fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Source control measures such as removing infected lines or drains may be necessary.

2. Septic emboli: The patient's history of line-associated infections and recent head CT findings concerning for septic emboli indicate a potential risk for embolic events. This could lead to complications such as ischemic stroke, pulmonary embolism, or amputations. Close monitoring of vital signs, neurologic status, and frequent imaging studies may be required.

3. Right lower lobe pneumonia: The CT abdomen showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on the culture sensitivity results.

4. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of aspiration events at home, and her recent CXR did not show any significant pathology. However, there is a concern for both right-sided and"

The patient is a 47-year-old female with [**Location (un) 2455**] syndrome who has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since [**2123**] due to short gut syndrome. She has a history of multiple surgeries, line infections, and clotted veins. The patient presents with sepsis and suspicion of septic emboli.

The patient has a long history of line-associated infections and previous negative [**Year (4 digits) **] without vegetations. She recently had her line exchanged on [**2146-7-29**]. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Septic shock: The patient is hypotensive with 18% bandemia and elevated lactate levels. She has a history of line-associated infections, and exam findings along with recent head CT findings are concerning for septic emboli. The patient has not had a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) yet. She is being treated with daptomycin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and micafungin. Her fluid balance needs to be monitored, and if needed, levophed should be used. A repeat chest X-ray is also needed. The patient should be followed by infectious disease (ID) for further recommendations.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with Gardner syndrome, who has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since [**2123**] and has a history of recurrent line infections. She presents with GNR bacteremia and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, but she has evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA) and small bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 8.8 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 132 K/uL. Other lab values indicate normal kidney function, but slightly elevated liver enzymes. Imaging shows perivascular fat stranding, small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, right lower lobe consolidation, and small bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GNR Bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection indicated by GNR bacteremia. It is crucial to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and await speciation of the GNR bacteria for appropriate targeted therapy.
2. Right Lower Lobe Pneumonia (RLL PNA): The patient has evidence of right lower lobe consolidation, which is concerning for infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.
3. Pleural Effusions: The presence of small bilateral pleural effusions indicates"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with [Location (un) 2455] syndrome who has undergone multiple surgeries resulting in short gut syndrome. She has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) since [2123] and presents with sepsis and suspicion of septic emboli. The patient's medical history includes multiple line infections and clotted veins. She has altered mental status, anemia, alteration in nutrition, bacteremia, ineffective coping, acute renal failure, septic shock, and pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic emboli: The patient has a history of septic emboli to fingertips and toes, which can lead to tissue damage and potential amputation.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may require dialysis and further management.
3. Line-related infections: The patient's history of multiple line infections increases the risk of further infections related to central venous lines.
4. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of venous thromboses and pulmonary embolism (PE), which can lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and potentially recurrent PE.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's short gut syndrome and dependence on TPN may increase the risk of malnutrition and associated complications.
6. Ineffective coping: The patient's ineffective coping mechanisms may contribute to her altered mental status and overall well-being.
7. Pain"
