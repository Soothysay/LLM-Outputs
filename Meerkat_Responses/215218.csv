   Assessment and Plan
   63yo woman admitted after open cholecystectomy and transferred to the
   ICU in the setting of persistent post-op pain, hypoxia, and decreased
   urine output.
   # Leukocytosis and fever:
   CXR suggestive of infection.  Given history of recent emesis, may have
   been from aspiration, although she was coughing even before her
   procedure.  Would also be concerned about possible abdominal sources of
   infection given persistent, severe post-op pain.
   - cover with vanc/levo/flagyl for now
   - appreciate surgery's input
   - follow closely with serial abdominal exams; surgery is en route to
   reassess patient
   - consider obtaining CT abdomen vs bringing patient back to OR after
   discussing case with surgery and monitoring her clinically
   - follow serial lactate (currently not elevated)
   - f/u urine, sputum and blood cultures
   - f/u viral cultures; on respiratory precautions for now
   # Acute renal failure:
   Likely prerenal.  Will give IV fluids and monitor urine output.  In the
   meantime, will check urine lytes and renally dose all medications.
   Finally, will avoid renally toxic meds such as her home ibuprofen and
   lisinopril.
   # Altered mental status:
   Likely from narcotic pain medications, but also will need monitoring
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Alternatively, altered mental
   status may be a sign of developing sepsis.
   - minimize narcotic medications
   - monitor ABG and consider CPAP vs intubation if retaining CO2
   - frequent reorientation
   - avoid sedating meds
   # Respiratory acidosis:
   [**Month (only) 11**] be due to underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation vs decreased
   respiratory drive while on narcotics.
   - place A-line to monitor ABGs closely
   - may need CPAP vs intubation
   # Pain control:
   - demerol has been effective for her in the past, so will try demerol
   per surgery's recommendation
   - pt declined epidural
   - concern for severe abdominal tenderness/peritoneal signs as discussed
   above
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 36, current Hct 29
   - monitor serial Hct to confirm she is not actively bleeding
   - check hemolysis labs
   - active type and screen
   # HTN:
   - hold home BP meds for now
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine
   # OSA:  CPAP at night if not intubated
   # ADD:  hold adderall

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman admitted after open cholecystectomy and transferred to the ICU due to persistent post-operative pain, hypoxia, and decreased urine output. She is currently intubated and has a central line placed. Her vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure. She has leukocytosis and an elevated lipase level, suggesting possible pancreatitis. She also has decreased breath sounds at the bases with bronchial breath sounds at the right base, indicating a possible pneumonia. She is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 500 mL. Her blood cultures, urine cultures, and sputum cultures have been sent. She has acute renal failure likely due to prerenal causes and is receiving IV fluids. Her altered mental status may be due to narcotic pain medications or hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has respiratory acidosis, possibly from underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation or decreased respiratory drive while on narcotics. She is also experiencing severe abdominal pain with rebound and guarding, which may indicate an intra-abdominal source of infection. Other issues include anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, OSA, and ADD. The patient is being closely monitored with serial abdominal exams, frequent reorientation, and ABG monitoring. The plan includes covering with antibiotics, minimizing narcotic medications, considering CPAP or"

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo woman admitted after open cholecystectomy and transferred to the
   ICU in the setting of persistent post-op pain, hypoxia, and decreased
   urine output.
   # Leukocytosis and fever:
   CXR suggestive of infection.  Given history of recent emesis, may have
   been from aspiration, although she was coughing even before her
   procedure.  Would also be concerned about possible abdominal sources of
   infection given persistent, severe post-op pain. However, in OR no abd
   source seen, also ERCP appeared normal. Bronch showed likely infection
   in RLL with edudative sections. Therefore, likely has aspiration PNA.
   - cover with vanc/levo/flagyl for now
   - appreciate surgery's input, likely transfer to surgery today to SICU
   - follow closely with serial abdominal exams; surgery is en route to
   reassess patient
   - f/u urine, sputum and blood cultures
   # Acute renal failure:
   Likely prerenal.  Will give IV fluids and monitor urine output.  In the
   meantime, will check urine lytes and renally dose all medications.
   Finally, will avoid renally toxic meds such as her home ibuprofen and
   lisinopril. Renal failure improving today
   - may need to redose meds as renal function changes
   # Altered mental status:
   Likely from narcotic pain medications,
   - now sedated
   # Respiratory acidosis:
   [**Month (only) 11**] be due to underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation in addition to
   acute aspiration PNA. Was intubated on [**7-6**].
   - will ween FIO2 as tolerated, then wean PEEP
   - nebs PRN
   - abx of PNA as above
   # Pain control:
   - demerol has been effective for her in the past, so will try demerol
   per surgery's recommendation
   - pt declined epidural
   - concern for severe abdominal tenderness/peritoneal signs as discussed
   above
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 36, current Hct 32.6 after transfusion. No sign
   of bleeding on ex-lap last night. Hemolysis labs are negative.
   - monitor serial Hct [**Hospital1 **] for bleeding
   - active type and screen
   # HTN:
   - hold home BP meds for now
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine

   Disposition: Transfer to SICU today.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman who was admitted after an open cholecystectomy. She is currently in the ICU due to persistent post-operative pain, hypoxia, and decreased urine output. 

The patient's medical history includes leukocytosis and fever, acute renal failure, altered mental status, respiratory acidosis, pain control issues, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and attention deficit disorder (ADD).

The assessment and plan include covering with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole for suspected aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient is likely to be transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) for further evaluation and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory distress due to aspiration PNA, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further deterioration of renal function. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, urine output, and laboratory results to detect any potential complications early on."

   Assessment and Plan
   63yo woman admitted after open cholecystectomy and transferred to the
   ICU in the setting of persistent post-op pain, hypoxia, and decreased
   urine output.
   # Leukocytosis and fever:
   CXR suggestive of infection.  Given history of recent emesis, may have
   been from aspiration, although she was coughing even before her
   procedure.  Would also be concerned about possible abdominal sources of
   infection given persistent, severe post-op pain.
   - cover with vanc/levo/flagyl for now
   - appreciate surgery's input
   - follow closely with serial abdominal exams; surgery is en route to
   reassess patient
   - consider obtaining CT abdomen vs bringing patient back to OR after
   discussing case with surgery and monitoring her clinically
   - follow serial lactate (currently not elevated)
   - f/u urine, sputum and blood cultures
   - f/u viral cultures; on respiratory precautions for now
   # Acute renal failure:
   Likely prerenal.  Will give IV fluids and monitor urine output.  In the
   meantime, will check urine lytes and renally dose all medications.
   Finally, will avoid renally toxic meds such as her home ibuprofen and
   lisinopril.
   # Altered mental status:
   Likely from narcotic pain medications, but also will need monitoring
   for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Alternatively, altered mental
   status may be a sign of developing sepsis.
   - minimize narcotic medications
   - monitor ABG and consider CPAP vs intubation if retaining CO2
   - frequent reorientation
   - avoid sedating meds
   # Respiratory acidosis:
   [**Month (only) 11**] be due to underlying OSA/chronic hypoventilation vs decreased
   respiratory drive while on narcotics.
   - place A-line to monitor ABGs closely
   - may need CPAP vs intubation
   # Pain control:
   - demerol has been effective for her in the past, so will try demerol
   per surgery's recommendation
   - pt declined epidural
   - concern for severe abdominal tenderness/peritoneal signs as discussed
   above
   # Anemia:  baseline Hct 36, current Hct 29
   - monitor serial Hct to confirm she is not actively bleeding
   - check hemolysis labs
   - active type and screen
   # HTN:
   - hold home BP meds for now
   # Hypothyroidism:  continue levothyroxine
   # OSA:  CPAP at night if not intubated
   # ADD:  hold adderall
   # FEN:  NPO; IV fluids as above
   # PPx:  subQ heparin; famotidine
   # Access:  PIVs; will likely need art line and central line
   # Code:  FULL (confirmed with HCP)
   # Comm:  with surgery ([**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] [**Numeric Identifier 6619**]) and family (daughter [**Name (NI) 6620**]
   is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6621**])

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old woman who was admitted after undergoing an open cholecystectomy. She was then transferred to the ICU due to persistent post-operative pain, hypoxia, and decreased urine output. 

The patient's medical history includes leukocytosis and fever, acute renal failure, altered mental status, respiratory acidosis, pain control, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, and attention deficit disorder. 

Initial assessment and plan include covering with antibiotics for possible infection, monitoring for sepsis, managing acute renal failure with IV fluids, minimizing narcotic medications, monitoring ABG levels, and considering CPAP or intubation if necessary. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 115 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% face mask. 

Physical examination reveals a symmetric face with small pupils, clear oropharynx, neck that is supple without thyroid enlargement or adenopathy, regular tachycardia, systolic murmur at the apex, decreased breath sounds at the bases with bronchial breath sounds at the right base, and an expiratory wheeze. 

The patient's abdomen is tender throughout, especially at the right upper quadrant, with rebound and guarding present. Bowel sounds are present"
