   Assessment and Plan: This is a [**Age over 90 211**] year-old female with CHF, CAD, AS/AI,
   asthma, presents with dyspnea and fever, now intubated.
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial. Concern for pneumonia given fever and
   cough, could be bacterial vs viral. Based on CXR and elevated BNP, also
   likely element of CHF. Additionally, pt is wheezy with poor air
   movement throughout, which supports asthma exacerbation (vs cardiac
   wheeze). Given lasix 40 x 1 with 1 L negative since admission.  CE neg
   x 2.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AS)/aortic insufficiency (AI), asthma, presenting with dyspnea and fever. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely bacterial or viral, and there is also evidence of CHF and asthma exacerbation. She has been started on empirical antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and meropenem, and her blood and urine cultures are pending. The patient's blood pressure has been stable since being given intravenous fluids, and she is now normotensive. Her cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no recent myocardial infarction. The patient's fever has resolved, and she remains afebrile in the ICU. Her white blood cell count is normal, but other laboratory values such as hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings suggest pneumonia. Continued surveillance for any worsening respiratory symptoms or signs of infection is necessary.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a [**Age over 90 211**] year-old female with CHF, CAD, AS/AI,
   asthma, presents with dyspnea and fever, now intubated.
   # Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial. Concern for pneumonia given fever and
   cough, could be bacterial vs viral. Based on CXR and elevated BNP, also
   likely element of CHF. Additionally, pt is wheezy with poor air
   movement throughout, which supports asthma exacerbation (vs cardiac
   wheeze). Given lasix 40 x 1 with 1 L negative since admission.  CE neg
   x 2.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - alb and atrovent MDI
   - prednisone 60mg PO daily
   - repeat lasix, goal 1 L net negative today
   - cover empirically with vanco/meropenem; watch for allergic reaction
   on meropenem given h/o rash to penicillin (~10% cross reactivity), if
   cx negative x 48 hours will consider changing abx regimen
   - daily CXR
   - check TTE to eval systolic function, aortic valve
   .
   # Afib c/ RVR. Patient afib with rates to 120's, initially with 5mg IV
   metoprolol, then 25mg PO metoprolol x 2 with some response. Rate now in
   80s.
   - Metoprolol currently at 25 mg tid, will attempt to increase to home
   dose (metoprolol 50 mg tid) as BP tolerates.
   # Fever: Likely pulmonary source given cough and no other localizing
   signs or symptoms of infection. Blood and urine cx pending, though UA
   negative. Continues to be afebrile in ICU. No leukocytosis.
   - empiric vanco/meropenem
   - f/u bcx, ucx
   - send sputum cx
   - cont to monitor fever/WBC curve
   - tylenol prn
   .
   # Hypotension: In ED in the setting of intubation and sedation meds.
   Quickly resolved with IVF. Now normotensive. Has history of
   hypertension.
   - cont to monitor
   - infectious w/u and management as above
   - add back home antihypertensives as BP tolerates.
   # CAD: h/o MI in [**2178**]. Per OMR, has rest angina at baseline. Trop neg
   in ED, EKG at baseline with old LBBB.
   - cycle enzymes, CE neg x 2
   - cont ASA, statin
   - restart BB and ACEI as BP tolerates

","Summary:
The patient is a 91-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial stenosis/atrial fibrillation (AS/AI), and asthma. She was admitted with respiratory failure and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient's condition has been complicated by an unresponsive episode during spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), flash pulmonary edema, and suspected aspiration event. She remains intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure is ongoing due to flash pulmonary edema and possible pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and management of respiratory support are necessary.
2. Pneumonia: Given the fever and cough, there is a concern for pneumonia. Cultures are pending, and appropriate antibiotic coverage has been initiated.
3. Heart failure: Elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrating diastolic dysfunction indicate heart failure as another contributing factor to the respiratory failure.
4. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's wheeziness on admission suggests an asthma exacerbation, possibly triggered by the pneumonia.
5. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension upon admission but quickly resolved with intravenous fluids (IVF). It is important to monitor blood pressure closely.
6. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR): The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AS)/aortic insufficiency (AI), asthma, presents with respiratory failure. She was initially intubated due to an unresponsive episode during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and concerns for aspiration. The patient received 40 mg IV lasix three times and was restarted on her home blood pressure medications, including metoprolol, imdur, and lisinopril.

The patient has been afebrile since admission and is currently intubated with CPAP/PSV ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 109/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on a ventilator with a tidal volume set at 380 mL, respiratory support pressure of 5 cmH2O, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 170.

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic stenosis (AS)/aortic insufficiency (AI), asthma, presenting with respiratory failure. She was admitted due to respiratory failure, which was likely multifactorial and included elements of pneumonia and heart failure. She had an unresponsive episode during spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), concerning for aspiration event or flash pulmonary edema, so she remained intubated. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including metoprolol, imdur, lisinopril, lasix, midazolam, fentanyl, and vancomycin/meropenem empirically for suspected infection. She also has a history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and rest angina, but cardiac enzymes and EKG ruled out acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 

She is currently hypotensive overnight but responded well to intravenous fluids (IVF) initially. Her blood pressure was also high at home, so her home BP medications were restarted. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1Â°C (98.8Â°F), heart rate of 91 bpm (with atrial fibrillation), blood pressure ranging from 109/59 mmHg to 168/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PS"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial septal defect (AS/AI), asthma, presenting with respiratory failure. She was extubated yesterday and received 40 mg IV lasix. Her 24-hour total body water loss is -1.4 L, with a goal of -2.2 L per day. Antibiotics were discontinued yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, and although she was successfully extubated, there is a risk of recurrence due to her underlying conditions such as CHF and asthma.
2. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive on admission but quickly resolved with intravenous fluids. However, she became hypertensive overnight and had to restart her home blood pressure medications.
3. Fever: Although the patient has been afebrile since admission, it is important to monitor for any signs of infection and continue trend fever/WBC curve.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR): The patient has a history of AFib, and her heart rate is currently controlled with metoprolol. It is important to continue monitoring her heart rate and adjust the dose of metoprolol as necessary.
5. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and previous myocardial infarction"
