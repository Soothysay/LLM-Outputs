","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and fluid overload. She has a history of shortness of breath and is currently on non-rebreather oxygen therapy. The patient's allergies include penicillins and amoxicillin. She has been receiving lasix 40 IV to address fluid overload, and her urine output has improved. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 121/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, otherwise clear, and trace edema in the left lower leg. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. The patient's CXR shows increased opacity in the airspaces, suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or lateral pneumonia. Microbiology cultures are pending. The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for hypoxic respiratory failure, management of metastatic melanoma, and tobacco dependence. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged hypoxia: The patient's marked hypoxia could lead to complications such as tissue damage, organ dysfunction, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently admitted to the ICU with severe hypoxemia and increased oxygen requirement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate between 95-112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/74 mmHg to 141/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is on non-rebreather oxygen delivery and requires respiratory support. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, distant heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. However, the patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 103 mg/dL. Imaging shows diffuse ground glass seen with suggestion of consolidation in the left lower lobe and suggestion of collapse in the right lower lobe, with some interval improvement in ground glass opacity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is severe hypoxemia, which is a critical condition requiring immediate attention. If not properly managed, it may lead to further respiratory failure and potential organ damage.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of consolidation in the left lower lobe suggests the possibility of pneumonia. If left untreated,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of newly diagnosed melanoma and is currently receiving treatment. Upon admission, the patient was given lasix 40 IV and diuresed well. A repeat chest X-ray was ordered to assess for consolidation on the previous day's chest X-ray. Physical examination revealed asymmetrical swelling of the lower extremities, leading to the ordering of lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI), which showed a positive finding of a large left node measuring 3.9 cm and another node measuring 1.1 cm. However, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was ruled out. Oncology was notified, and no changes in management were made at this time. The patient still requires a full staging workup. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 87-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/68-134/87 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 18-34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device. ABG results show hypoxemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema. She has undergone IL-2 treatment and is currently receiving lasix, levofloxacin, and other medications. The patient has shown improvement in her condition overnight, with a reduction in diuresis and improvement in leukocytosis. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in heart rate. Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs bilaterally, and there is trace edema in the left lower leg. Laboratory results indicate mild leukocytosis and normal levels of hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes. Imaging shows no evidence of deep vein thrombosis but reveals a left inguinal node measuring 3.9 cm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged pulmonary edema: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may persist or worsen if the underlying cause of pulmonary edema is not adequately addressed.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient's initial leg ultrasound did not show any signs of DVT, the presence of asymmetrical swelling in the lower extremities and the prolonged immobilization in the ICU increase the risk of developing DVT. Regular assessment for symptoms of DVT and continuation of prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin are recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [**Known lastname 11473**] is a 35-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema. She underwent IL-2 treatment and was responding well to lasix overnight, with a reduction in fluid intake. She is currently on 70% FiO2, showing an SpO2 of 98%. The patient has asymmetrical swelling of the lower extremities and a large left inguinal lymph node, which was found to be negative for deep vein thrombosis but showed a left node measuring 3.9 cm and another node measuring 1.1 cm. The oncology team stated that there is no change in management at this time, and the patient needs a full staging workup since the diagnosis is newly diagnosed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's marked hypoxia is likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of capillary leak from IL-2 therapy. Close monitoring of oxygenation and continued management with lasix, strict intake/output measurements, daily chest X-ray, weaning of oxygen as needed, and continuation of levofloxacin are recommended.

2. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient has newly diagnosed metastatic melanoma now treated with IL-2 therapy. The newly identified inguinal node on the left lower extremity needs further evaluation, and the oncology team recommends full"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 11473], a 35-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema. She has a history of metastatic melanoma and has undergone IL-2 treatment. The patient presented with shortness of breath and was diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure. She responded well to diuretics and is now on 70% FiO2. She also has leukocytosis, which is improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's marked hypoxia is likely secondary to pulmonary edema in the setting of capillary leak from IL-2 therapy. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory support is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Metastatic melanoma: The patient has newly diagnosed metastatic melanoma. It is crucial to continue oncological recommendations and provide pain control for the management of this condition.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the LENI showed no evidence of DVT, prophylaxis for DVT should continue due to the patient's immobility in the ICU.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Strict adherence to infection control measures and daily chest X-rays are necessary to monitor and prevent VAP.
5. Tobacco dependence: The patient is on nicotine patches to manage tobacco dependence. Monitoring and support for smoking cessation should continue during her ICU stay."

","The patient is a 35-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure associated with IL-2 therapy. The patient has shown mild improvement in oxygenation with empiric antibiotics and continued negative fluid balance, but not as rapidly as expected.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's main concern is hypoxemia, which is likely due to respiratory failure. This can lead to inadequate oxygen supply to vital organs, resulting in tissue damage and organ dysfunction.

2. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient has metastatic melanoma, a type of skin cancer that can spread to other parts of the body. Complications may include pain, organ dysfunction, and potential spread of the cancer to other areas.

3. IL-2 Therapy: The patient is receiving IL-2 therapy, which is commonly used to treat melanoma. However, this treatment can have its own set of complications, such as cytokine release syndrome, which can cause symptoms like fever, rash, and hypotension.

4. Negative Fluid Balance: The patient has a continued negative fluid balance, indicating a loss of fluids from the body. This can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and decreased blood pressure.

5. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has mild improvement in bilateral pulmonary edema seen on imaging. If left untreated, this can progress and lead to severe respiratory distress and cardiac complications.

","The patient is a 35-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who has been treated with IL-2 therapy. She is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema. Her vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure within normal range. The patient's lungs are clear except for crackles at the bases bilaterally. There is also trace edema in her left lower leg. 

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit level, and platelet count. Her creatinine and electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's CXR shows worsening pulmonary edema and possible new confluent opacities in both lower lobes, but no pleural effusions. 

The assessment and plan include treating the hypoxic respiratory failure with lasix and oxygen therapy, getting a daily CXR, weaning off oxygen as tolerated, continuing levofloxacin for empiric pneumonia treatment, and strict input/output monitoring. The patient also has a newly diagnosed metastatic melanoma with an identified inguinal node on the left lower extremity. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pulmonary edema, infection due to immunosuppressive therapy, and further progression of metastatic melanoma."

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema. She has been treated with lasix and is responding well, with a decrease in fluid accumulation. The patient is also being given levofloxacin for empirical pneumonia treatment, and her leukocytosis is improving. The plan is to continue lasix, monitor strict intake and output, perform daily chest X-rays, wean oxygen as tolerated, and continue levofloxacin. No steroids are being administered due to recent IL2 therapy. The patient has a newly diagnosed metastatic melanoma and an enlarged inguinal lymph node. She is also being treated for tobacco dependence with nicotine patches. Her blood sugar is well-controlled, and she is on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Worsening pulmonary edema: The patient's condition could deteriorate if the pulmonary edema worsens, leading to further respiratory distress.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her immunocompromised state from IL2 therapy and the presence of a central line.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is on prophylaxis, there is still a risk of developing DVT due to immobility and other risk factors"

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and shortness of breath. They have allergies to penicillins and amoxicillin, and received lasix 40mg twice. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 121/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula. Fluid balance shows an intake of 430 mL and output of 2350 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1920 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. The patient has a history of melanoma and is receiving ICU care, including nutrition and glycemic control. The patient's code status is unknown, and their disposition is pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure indicates a compromised respiratory system. Continued monitoring and support are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an ongoing infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.
3. Fluid imbalance: The significant negative fluid balance indicates ongoing fluid losses. Monitoring fluid status and adjusting fluid administration accordingly is crucial to maintain hemodynamic stability.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old individual with metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemia and likely pulmonary edema. The patient has shown a significant response to lasix and has achieved a negative fluid balance.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/80 mmHg to 132/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is currently on nasal cannula for respiratory support.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, with normal head, ears, nose, and throat findings. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and distant S2 heart sounds, while peripheral vascular examination could not assess the pulses of the right radial, right distal (DP) pulse, or left DP pulse. Respiratory/chest examination indicates symmetric expansion, resonant percussion note, and diminished breath sounds. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. Extremities show 2+ right lower extremity edema but no edema in the left lower extremity. Neurologic examination notes the patient as attentive, following simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, with movement and tone not assessed.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 12.9 g/dL, white blood cell"
