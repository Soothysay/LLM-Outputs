   unresponsiveness found to be hypoglycemic and have UTI.
   #Hypotension- Etiology may be sepsis vs volume depletion.He was found
   to have a positive U/A with >50WBCS (was was getting straight cath'd at
   rehab manipulating the region); he was currently being treated for a
   UTI at rehab (PICC in place); sensetivities from [**Hospital1 586**] reveal Klebsiella
   UTI sensetive only to Tigecycline (MIC of 1 and urine cultures at [**Hospital1 586**]
   had cleared by [**2056-1-24**]). Lactate 0.8 on admission. It could be a new
   bug causing UTI vs PICC line infection. Renal ultrasound overnight

   improved after dextrose load. CT Head in ED prelminary read negative.
   Noted to have UTI; most likely MS changes due to combination of
   infection and hypoglycemia.  Other etiology could include seizure
   although less likely given above circumstances
   -Monitor FS closely
   -Follow up final read of CT
   #Hypoglycemia/DM-Patient presented with FS 15; persistantly
   hypoglycemic despite dextrose, may  have been due to long acting Lantus
   that was just resumed at rehab in setting of poor PO intake.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He presented to the ICU unresponsive and was found to be hypoglycemic with a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has a positive urinalysis with over 50 white blood cells (WBCs) and his urine cultures from a previous hospitalization showed sensitivity to Tigecycline. He has been treated for a UTI at the rehabilitation facility. Renal ultrasound overnight did not show any evidence of fluid collection or abscess.

The patient has been receiving levophed, and his urine output remains brisk. His cardiac enzymes remain flat. He is currently on multiple medications including Coumadin, Omeprazole, and Dextrose 50%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 83 bpm with a range of 64-93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/80 mmHg to 141/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute with a range of 11-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He presents with unresponsiveness, hypoglycemia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). 

Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to sepsis or volume depletion. It is important to monitor his vital signs closely and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

2. UTI: The patient has a confirmed UTI caused by Klebsiella, which is sensitive only to Tigecycline. The source of infection could be the percutaneous central venous line (CVL) or a new bug. Further investigation is needed, including serial lactate levels, CV02 monitoring, follow-up blood and urine cultures, and consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood glucose levels are likely due to a combination of infection and poor oral intake. He requires close monitoring of his fasting blood sugar (FS) levels and administration of dextrose.

4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: Given the presence of hypotension, UTI, and elevated lactate levels, the patient is at risk for sepsis. Continuous monitoring and prompt management are necessary to"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of multiple allergies, including quinolones and oxacillin, and is currently receiving various medications such as norepinephrine, omeprazole, levophed, duloxetine, simvastatin, tigecycline, and warfarin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/62 mmHg to 141/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support but does not require supplemental oxygen. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is receiving anticoagulation therapy. The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 4,498 mL and output of 2,950 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient has erythematous right foot around the joints, indicating possible gout or inflammation. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while other values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate sepsis or volume depletion. The medical team is attempting to wean off the pressors and monitor for further improvement.
2. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): Las"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with h/o CAD, PAF, CHF, Renal Cell CA, CRI presents with
   unresponsiveness found to be hypoglycemic and have UTI.
   #Hypotension- Resolved. On presentation, etiology may have been sepsis
   vs volume depletion.He was found to have a positive U/A with >50WBCS
   (was was getting straight cath'd at rehab manipulating the region); he
   was currently being treated for a UTI at rehab (PICC in place);
   sensetivities from [**Hospital1 586**] reveal Klebsiella UTI sensetive only to
   Tigecycline (MIC of 1 and urine cultures at [**Hospital1 586**] had cleared by
   [**2056-1-24**]).  Here it is sentitive to gent. Lactate 0.8 on admission. It
   could be a new bug causing UTI vs PICC line infection. Renal ultrasound
   overnight without  evidence of fluid collection/abscess
   -Continue Tigecycline 50mg q12
   -CVP goal [**8-15**]
   -Follow up blood, urine cultures
   -Follow up PICC line culture
   - ID consult if persistently febrile
   - add tigecycline sensi
   -Need to obtain records from [**Hospital1 586**] given extensive UTI history
   #[**Name (NI) 11457**] Pt found unresponsive; glucose at time 17; now MS
   improved after dextrose load. CT Head in ED prelminary read negative.
   Noted to have UTI; most likely MS changes due to combination of
   infection and hypoglycemia.  Other etiology could include seizure
   although less likely given above circumstances
   -Monitor FS closely
   -Follow up final read of CT
   #Hypoglycemia/DM-Patient presented with FS 15; persistantly
   hypoglycemic despite dextrose, may  have been due to long acting Lantus
   that was just resumed at rehab in setting of poor PO intake.
   -Monitor FS q1hour
   -encourage po intake
   -Holding home insulin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (PAF), congestive heart failure (CHF), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He was found unresponsive and was hypoglycemic with a UTI. His initial presentation suggested sepsis vs volume depletion, but his current condition has improved. He has a positive U/A with >50 WBCs, and his urine culture showed Klebsiella UTI sensitive only to Tigecycline. Renal ultrasound did not show any evidence of fluid collection/abscess. He is currently being treated with Tigecycline, and his PICC line culture is pending. 

The patient also has hypoglycemia, which was initially thought to be due to long-acting Lantus insulin that was resumed at the rehab facility in the setting of poor oral intake. His MS improved after a dextrose load. A CT head in the ED was negative for any acute changes. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), and his fasting blood sugar (FS) has been persistently low despite dextrose administration. 

The patient's CRI is indicated by a creatinine level of 2.1 on admission, which is considered baseline according to his primary care physician (PCP). His current renal status is likely pre-renal given poor oral"
