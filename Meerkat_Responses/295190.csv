   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, hypothyroidism, neuropathic pain, type 2 diabetes, and bladder and prostate cancer status post ileal conduit. He was found unresponsive at home and has been diagnosed with severe non-gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Severe metabolic acidosis: The patient has a normal anion gap, indicating a non-gap metabolic acidosis. Common triggers for this type of acidosis are negative, and there is no evidence of gastrointestinal losses. Respiratory compensation is slightly suboptimal. It is likely related to underlying low bicarbonate in the setting of an ileal conduit complicated by poor oral intake. The patient received sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and D5W yesterday. The plan is to continue D5W at 250 mL/hr, follow electrolytes every 4 hours, and allow the patient to drink to thirst now that mental status has improved.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved today. The most likely cause of altered mental status is toxic metabolic, possibly related to ingestions. Toxicology results are negative, so toxic alcohols are less likely. The patient appears to be protecting his airway, and mental status much improved today. The plan is to follow up with avoiding sedating medications.

3. Renal failure - acute on chronic: The patient has a history of acute on chronic renal failure. Recent creatinine from VA records is 1.7, still above baseline but much improved today. The patient has impressive urine output, so obstruction is unlikely. Urine ultrasound is normal. The plan is to trend creatinine, follow nephrology recommendations, and consider renally dosing medications.

4. Positive urine analysis: The patient has a positive urine analysis, unclear anatomy. It is unclear whether the ileum is serving as the bladder, in which case the significance of pyuria is unclear. The patient's wife is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. The plan is to hold on antibiotics for now unless fevers develop, gather information on anatomy and past urologic procedures, and consider a urology consult.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia is now resolved. The plan is to continue following up on it.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of approximately 7L today. The elevation in sodium overnight is likely related to the combination of sodium in NaHCO3 and impressive urine output, likely very dilute. The plan is to continue free water repletion with D5W and allow the patient to drink water now that mental status has improved.

7. Anemia: The patient has mild anemia, unclear baseline. The plan is to follow up on"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 66 yo M with  bladder / prostate cancer with
   renal diversion, EtOH abuse, HTN, DM2 admitted with NAG acidosis,
   hypernatremia, hyperkalemia and ARF. Found down by family with profound
   aciosis, pH 7.0. Yesterday had A-line placed, renal us unremarkable,
   bicarb and D5, renal consult appreciated, insulin regimen increased.
   Had run wide complex tachycardia last night, HD stable.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.2   Tc 97.8 BP 132/65 HR 68-94 RR 18 with sat 99
   on RA, - 1 Liter  More alert (oriented X 3, only confused about
   which hospital but knows he is in ICU), cooperative, in NAD. CTA B rrr
   Soft NT +BS. No edema. Labs notable for WBC 3.7, HCT 31.4, na 155, K+
   4.0, Cr 2.4 (coming down). No new CXR; MICRO with urine GNRs --> 100K e
   coli ( [**5-15**] rbc and wbc on u/a)
   66 yo M who presented with profound NAG acidosis and ARF.
   Agree with plan to continue rehydration with NaHCO3 IVP and
   aggressive IV D5W repletion for acidosis and hypernatremia.
   Hyperkalemia has resolved.  AMS likely related to electrolyte
   abnormlaities and hypernatremia, now much improved. Appreciate renal
   input.  ARF is improving (VA OSH lab of 1.7 cr-? baseline). U/a with >
   100K e coli but given diversion suspect this is colonization as [**5-15**]
   rbc and wbc on u/a, remains af, and hemodynamically stable. Will need
   RISS for hyperglycemia in the setting of DM2 and aggressive D5W
   repletion. Will continue CIWA for possible etoh withdrawal-though has
   not required. Will start hydral for htn. OSH records list lisinopril,
   but will continue to hold given ARF. Will restart synthroid (check TSH)
   and asa. Advance diet with supervision. Remainder of plan as outlined
   above. Improving clinically but continue in ICU for now.  Monitor tachy
   runs on tele and follow lytes closely. Anticipate transition to floor
   tomorrow.
   Patient is critically ill.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of EtOH abuse, HTN, hypothyroidism, neuropathic pain, type 2 diabetes, and bladder and prostate cancer status post ileal conduit. He was found unresponsive at home and brought to the hospital with severe non-gap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and likely acute renal failure.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a severe non-gap metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by a low pH level of 7.0. This can lead to various complications such as respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and multi-organ dysfunction.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level of 155 mEq/L, indicating hypernatremia. This condition can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and coma if not corrected promptly.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as evidenced by an elevated creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL. ARF can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, metabolic abnormalities, and the need for renal replacement therapy.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient initially presented with hyperkalemia, which has since resolved. However, close monitoring is still necessary, as sudden increases in potassium levels can cause cardiac arrhythmias and"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   66 M with unclear PMH, found unresponsive at home; found to have severe
   nongap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure.
   .
   # Severe metabolic acidosis.  Normal AG of 10.  Tox screen negative.
   Common AG acidosis triggers negative (lactate and ketones).
   Methanol/Eth glycol less likely, as would expect anion gap but will
   check levels and would be reasonable to start fomepizole per toxicology
   recs.  Regarding non-gap etiologies; ARF seems most likely.  No
   evidence of GI losses.  Respiratory compensation only slightly
   suboptimal (mild relative respiratory acidosis).
   - sodium bicarb in D5W
   - appreciate tox recs
   - consider start fomepizole, 15mg/kg IV loading dose.
   - send methanol and ethylene glycol levels STAT to [**Hospital1 1910**] (per tox).
   - ARF workup and management as detailed below.
   - serum osmolality for osmol gap
   .
   # Altered mental status.  Most likely toxic metabolic given the above.
   Possibility of ingestions, tox negative, getting toxic alcohols as
   above.  CT head read as without acute process per OSH ED records.  LFTs
   normal.  No role for NAC per tox (given negative level and normal
   LFTs).  He appears to be protecting his airway.
   - follow
   - avoid sedating meds
   .
   # Renal failure. Acute vs. acute on chronic.  Baseline unknown.  Has
   reported history of obstruction so postrenal is a possibility.
   Intrarenal still on differential as is prerenal considering his unknown
   length of time down.
   - Obtain baselines
   - urine lytes
   - renal u/s
   - trend creatinine
   - nephrology aware, will see in AM.
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Positive UA. unclear anatomy. ? ileum serving as bladder, in which
   case significance of pyuria is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] is afebrile and HD stable.
   - hold on antibiotics for now unless fevers, etc
   - gather info on anatomy and past urologic procedures
   - consider urology consult
   .
   # Hyperkalemia. no acute EKG changes.  Suspect he will not cooperate
   with kayexalate.
   - trend K, if worsens/develops EKG changes, can consider insulin, etc.
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Free water deficit roughly 3-4 L.
   - free water repletion.
   .
   # Anemia. mild, unclear baseline.
   - follow
   .
   # hx of HTN. unknown if currently treated.
   - no antihypertensives for now as not significantly hypertensive
   - medication reconciliation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with unclear medical history who was found unresponsive at home. He has severe nongap metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, and likely acute renal failure. The patient's arterial line was started on 10/12/2131 at 04:16 PM. Renal ultrasound is normal, and renal consult recommends ammonia and IV fluids. The patient's insulin was increased, and a run of VT (ventricular tachycardia) for 1-7 seconds occurred. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/63 mmHg to 152/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Lab results show elevated potassium levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's urine output is low, and he has a positive urine analysis. The assessment includes severe metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap, hyperkalemia, likely acute renal failure, altered mental status, and hypernatremia. The plan involves correcting acidosis, addressing hyperkalemia, evaluating and managing renal failure, further investigating the cause of the renal failure"
