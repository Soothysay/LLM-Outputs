   Assessment and Plan
   55yo M with hx of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and
   epidural abcess secondary to IVDU presents with marked leukocytosis,
   dark diahrrea, tachypnea, atrial tachy-arrhythimia, and GPC bacteremia.
   # Sepsis/GPC bacteremia: sepsis in a man with IVDA and multiple prior
   infections.  Prior DDX was line infection vs. C diff (given diarrhea
   and high WBC) vs. biliary system vs. lungs vs. joints.  Given his new
   GPC bacteremia, suspect IVDU Staph bacteremia.  No obvious source for
   likely Staph bacteremia but unclear when he last used IV drugs.
   - cont broad covg with IV vanco/zosyn/cipro/PO vanco. UCx pending.
   - will check vanc level this PM.
   - d/c EJ line with plan for PICC tomorrow
   - TEE to r/o endocarditis
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation: target is UOP and tachycardia not a
   reliable marker.
   - Will image spine.
   - ID agrees with our w/u: image spine, IR guided aspiration of pelvic
   fluid, continue vanco for GPC bacteremia, pull the EJ.
   #  Back Pain: NSGY highly concerned for recurrence of abcess as they
   are under impression that laminectomy occured in [**2121-1-12**] when in fact
   occured in [**2119-1-12**]. Still on differential, but feel that this is the
   less likely etiology.  CT showing extensive peritoneal and
   retroperitoneal adenopathy and ? mass/abscess along pelvic wall.  LD
   elevated but not to level expected from a lymphoma.
   - plan for aspiration of pelvic collection today.   Will send fluid for
   gram stain, culture, send adenopathy tissue for pathology.
   - Given GPC in blood, hard to believe pelvis is source or even a
   metastatic focus but will aspirate under CT today.
   - MRI to assess possible spinal pathology
   # Painful L toe: ddx includes seeding from GPC bacteremia vs. crystal
   arthropathy (as pt gives hx of chronically painful toe).  Will not tap
   joint, since we are concerned for seeding/active infection.
   - will start low dose colchicine and monitor for improvement.
   #  Diahrrea: may be primary infection, though seems unlikely: guiaic
   positive but not melena, especially considering that Hct has [**Doctor First Name **] stable
   despite large amounts of dark stool. Given marked leukocytosis, concern
   for CDIFF. Toxin sent, initial neg. Empiric po vanco started.
   # Resp Status: Tenuous with tachypnea with wide A-a gradient, but
   improved today. Tachypnea may be mediated by cytokines related to
   sepsis.  Stable this AM on room air.
   # Altered Mental Status: unclear baseline, but seems improved today.
   Alteration likely [**1-13**] severe ongoing infection. Do not suspect CNS
   involvement of infxn.
   # Tachycardia: Atrial tachyarrhtymia. Hemodynamically tolearting
   elevated rate. Rate not indicative of intravascular depletion, but will
   rate control with metoprolol 12.5 mg TID

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of IV drug use (IVDA) who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple infectious complications, including an epidural abscess and septic arthritis. He presents with marked leukocytosis, dark diarrhea, tachypnea, and atrial tachyarrhythmia. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being aggressively resuscitated with fluids. A differential diagnosis is being considered, including possibilities such as Clostridium difficile infection, biliary system infection, lung infection, or joint infection. The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and there is concern for impending septic shock. Imaging of the spine is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Leukocytosis/Fever: The patient's presentation suggests sepsis, which can lead to septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Impending Septic Shock: The patient's tachycardia and leukocytosis indicate a high risk for septic shock.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and leukocytosis raise concern for C. difficile infection, which can be confirmed by testing for the toxin.

   55yo M with hx of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and
   epidural abcess secondary to IVDU presents with marked leukocytosis,
   dark diahrrea, tachypnea, and atrial tachy-arrhythimia.
   # Leukoytosis/fever: Concern for impending septic shock. No oragism
   isolated. Pt is on broad covg with vanco/zosyn/cipro. BCx pending. UCx
   pending. Aggressive fluid resuscitation: target is UOP ad tachycardia
   not a reliable marker.
   #  Diahrrea: may be primary infection: guiaic positive but not melena,
   especially considering that Hct has [**Doctor First Name **] stable despite large amounts of
   dark stool. Given marked leukocytosis, concern for CDIFF. Toxin sent.
   Empiric po vanco started.
   # Resp Status: Tenuous. Low threshold for intubation. Tachypnea may be
   mediated by cytokines related to sepsis. Appropriately hypocapnic and
   alkalemic given resp rate, but concern for fatigue given rate of 40+.
   Low threshold for intubation.
   #  Back Pain: NSGY highly concerned for recurrence of abcess as they
   are under impression that laminectomy occured in [**2121-1-12**] when in fact
   occured in [**2119-1-12**]. Still on differential, ut given diahrrea, feel
   that this is the less likely etiology.
   # Altered Mental Status: unclear baseline. Aalteration likely [**1-13**]
   severe ongoing infection. Do not suspect CNS involvement of infxn.
   # Tachycardia: Atrial tachyarrhtymia. Hemodynamically tolearting
   elevated rate. Rate not indicative of intravascular depletion. See no
   reason to pursue rate control curently as impending septic shock
   certainly still a possibility

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use. He presents with marked leukocytosis, dark diarrhea, tachypnea, and atrial tachyarrhythmia. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. Blood cultures and urine cultures are pending. The patient has received aggressive fluid resuscitation, targeting urine output and addressing tachycardia as an unreliable marker. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impending septic shock: The patient's marked leukocytosis and fever raise concern for impending septic shock. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary.
2. Clostridioides difficile infection (CDIFF): The patient's dark diarrhea may be indicative of CDIFF, especially considering his marked leukocytosis. A toxin test has been sent, and empiric oral vancomycin has been started.
3. Respiratory status: The patient's tachypnea may be mediated by cytokines related to sepsis. A low threshold for intubation is recommended due to the patient's tenuous respiratory status.
4. Recurrence of abscess: The patient's back pain raises concern for a possible recurrence of an abscess, especially given the history of laminectomy in 2019. However"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient has a complicated medical history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) and multiple infectious complications, including an epidural abscess and septic arthritis. They were transferred from another hospital with tachycardia, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and disorientation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/64 to 160/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is experiencing atrial flutter and requires respiratory support. Lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, as well as increased creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk for venous thromboembolism, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, such as fever and elevated white blood cell count, suggest an ongoing infection that could progress to sepsis.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, which can lead to irregular heart rhythm and potential complications if not managed properly.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require further investigation and management to prevent recurrence.

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain, fever, and chills. He was admitted to the ICU for sepsis secondary to severe acute pancreatitis. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Vancomycin. He also received Diltiazem, Metoprolol, Pantoprazole, and Morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 112/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has an abnormal blood gas showing respiratory alkalosis. The patient has received blood transfusions totaling 3,835 mL and has had a urine output of 3,585 mL. 

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 32.4 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 183 K/uL. The patient has elevated levels of troponin T, lactate, and LDH, indicating possible cardiac injury and tissue hypoperfusion. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's kidney function is impaired with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL"

   Assessment and Plan
   55yo M with hx of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and
   epidural abcess secondary to IVDU presents with marked leukocytosis,
   dark diahrrea, tachypnea, atrial tachy-arrhythimia, and Coag pos Staph
   bacteremia.
   # Sepsis/Coag pos staph bacteremia: sepsis in a man with IVDA and
   multiple prior infections.  Likely suspect line infection, but have
   also considered spinal etiology, oral etiology, pelvic fluid etiology.
   Given his new GPC bacteremia, suspect IVDU Staph bacteremia.  Remains
   unclear when he last used IV drugs.
   - cont broad covg with IV vanco/zosyn/cipro until speciation results.
   UCx pending.
   - d/c
ed EJ line,
   - Put in for TEE
   - ID agrees with our w/u: image spine, IR guided aspiration of pelvic
   fluid, continue vanco for GPC bacteremia, pull the EJ.  Consider dental
   consult for his teeth as a potential source for his bacteremia.
   #  Back Pain: NSGY highly concerned for recurrence of abcess as they
   are under impression that laminectomy occured in [**2121-1-12**] when in fact
   occured in [**2119-1-12**]. Still on differential, but feel that this is the
   less likely etiology.  CT showing extensive peritoneal and
   retroperitoneal adenopathy and ? mass/abscess along pelvic wall.  LD
   elevated but not to level expected from a lymphoma.
   - underwent aspiration of pelvic collection.   Will send fluid for gram
   stain, culture, send adenopathy tissue for pathology.
   - Given GPC in blood, hard to believe pelvis is source or even a
   metastatic focus but will aspirate under CT today.
   - MRI to assess possible spinal pathology
   # Painful L toe/right elbow: ddx for this polyarthropathy includes
   seeding from GPC bacteremia vs. crystal arthropathy (as pt gives hx of
   chronically painful toe).  Will not tap the left toe, since we are
   concerned for seeding/active infection.  Will tap the elbow which is
   severely limited in range of motion.
   - started low dose colchicine and monitor for improvement.
   - the above represents possible metastatic focus
   #  Diahrrea: may be primary infection, though seems unlikely: guiaic
   positive but not melena, especially considering that Hct has [**Doctor First Name **] stable
   despite large amounts of dark stool. Given marked leukocytosis, concern
   for CDIFF. Toxin sent, neg x 2. Empiric po vanco can be stopped soon.
   # Resp Status: Tenuous with tachypnea with wide A-a gradient, but
   improved today. Tachypnea may be mediated by cytokines related to
   sepsis.  Stable this AM on room air.
   # Altered Mental Status: unclear baseline, but seems improved today.
   Alteration likely [**1-13**] severe ongoing infection. Do not suspect CNS
   involvement of infxn.
   # Tachycardia: Atrial tachyarrhtymia. Hemodynamically tolearting
   elevated rate. Rate not indicative of intravascular depletion, but will
   rate control with metoprolol 12.5-25 mg TID.  Will try to wean dilt
   gtt.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). The patient presents with marked leukocytosis, dark diarrhea, tachypnea, atrial tachyarrhythmia, and coagulasive positive Staphylococcus bacteremia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's current presentation of dark diarrhea, tachypnea, atrial tachyarrhythmia, and coagulasive positive Staphylococcus bacteremia suggests ongoing sepsis. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage until speciation results are available.

2. Line infection: The patient has a history of IVDU and has developed bacteremia with coagulasive positive Staphylococcus. This raises concern for a line infection, especially since the patient has had multiple lines placed. It is recommended to discontinue the existing central line and consider alternative methods for administering medication and fluids.

3. Pelvic abscess: The patient has a pelvic abscess that needs to be further evaluated and managed. Aspiration of the abscess and sending the fluid for gram stain, culture, and pathology is advised.

4. Back pain: The patient's back pain may be due to recurrent abscess or other spinal pathology. An"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU).
- He presents with marked leukocytosis, dark diarrhea, tachypnea, atrial tachy-arrhythmia, and GPC bacteremia.
- His previous differential diagnosis included line infection vs. Clostridium difficile (C diff) infection, biliary system infection, lung infection, and joint infection.
- Given his new GPC bacteremia, there is suspicion of IVDU-related Staph bacteremia.
- The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.
- He has undergone imaging of the spine, CT or US of the right elbow, and possible transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to rule out endocarditis.
- The patient also requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and dental consultation for his teeth as a potential source for bacteremia.
- Other issues include back pain, which is being evaluated for recurrence of abscess, painful left toe with suspected seeding from GPC bacteremia or crystal arthropathy, and diarrhea that may be primary infection or C diff infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). The patient presents with marked leukocytosis, dark diarrhea, tachypnea, atrial tachyarrhythmia, and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis/GPC bacteremia: The patient has a history of MRSA sepsis and now presents with GPC bacteremia. This suggests a possible ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis. Immediate management includes broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage and aggressive fluid resuscitation.

2. Back pain with concern for recurrence of abscess: The patient's back pain may indicate a recurrence of abscess formation. Imaging studies have shown extensive peritoneal and retroperitoneal adenopathy, as well as a possible mass/abscess along the pelvic wall. Aspiration of the pelvic fluid collection will be performed to gather more information.

3. Painful left toe: The patient has a painful left toe, which could be due to seeding from GPC bacteremia or crystal arthropathy. Low-dose colchicine has been started, and the toe will be monitored for improvement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). He presents with marked leukocytosis, dark diarrhea, tachypnea, atrial tachyarrhythmia, and GPC bacteremia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and GPC bacteremia, and the source of infection is unclear. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and will undergo further investigations to identify the source of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. GPC Bacteremia: The presence of GPC bacteremia increases the risk of complications related to bloodstream infections, such as endocarditis.
3. Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of IVDU and GPC bacteremia, there is a concern for endocarditis, which can lead to valve damage and systemic embolism.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by sepsis and dehydration.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea and wide A-a gradient suggest respiratory compromise. Close monitoring and possible mechanical ventilation may be necessary.

   fluid, continue vanco for GPC bacteremia, pull the EJ.  Consider dental
   consult for his teeth as a potential source for his bacteremia.

2. Back pain: The patient has back pain, and imaging studies are being conducted to evaluate for recurrence of abscess or other spinal pathology.
3. Painful L toe: The patient has a painful left toe, which could be due to seeding from GPC bacteremia or crystal arthropathy. Low-dose colchicine has been started, and monitoring for improvement is planned.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use. He presents with marked leukocytosis, dark diarrhea, tachypnea, atrial tachy-arrhythmia, and GPC bacteremia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Sepsis/GPC bacteremia: The patient has a history of MRSA sepsis and now presents with GPC bacteremia. This suggests ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of IV drug use and the presence of GPC bacteremia, there is a concern for endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered to rule out this condition.

3. Recurrence of abscess: The patient's back pain is concerning for a recurrence of abscess, especially since the neurosurgeons believe that a laminectomy occurred in [**2119-1-12**] instead of [**2121-1-12**]. Imaging of the spine has been recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use. He presents with marked leukocytosis, dark diarrhea, tachypnea, atrial tachyarrhythmia, and positive blood cultures for Coag positive Staph bacteremia. The patient is currently on vancomycin and is scheduled for an MRI tomorrow while intubated. A pelvic drain needs to be placed, as MRSA has grown out of his abscess. The patient also has back pain, for which an MRI of the spine is planned. He experiences painful toes and elbows, and plain films and ultrasound of the upper extremity are recommended to rule out venous thromboembolism. The patient has diarrhea, but C. difficile has been negative three times. He is guaiac positive, but not showing signs of melena. His respiratory status is tenuous with tachypnea and a wide A-a gradient, but has improved today. The patient's mental status is altered, but seems improved today. Tachycardia is present, and the patient is on diltiazem. The patient will be transitioning to oral medications. He will be NPO after midnight for procedures tomorrow.

   55yo M with hx of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and
   epidural abcess secondary to IVDU presents with marked leukocytosis,
   dark diahrrea, tachypnea, atrial tachy-arrhythimia, and Coag pos Staph
   bacteremia.
   # Sepsis/Coag pos staph bacteremia: sepsis in a man with IVDA and
   multiple prior infections.  Likely suspect line infection, but have
   also considered spinal etiology, oral etiology, pelvic fluid etiology.
   Given his new GPC bacteremia, suspect IVDU Staph bacteremia.  Remains
   unclear when he last used IV drugs.
   - cont broad covg with IV vanco/zosyn/cipro until speciation results.
   UCx pending.
   - d/c
ed EJ line,
   - Put in for TEE
   - ID agrees with our w/u: image spine, IR guided aspiration of pelvic
   fluid, continue vanco for GPC bacteremia, pull the EJ.  Consider dental
   consult for his teeth as a potential source for his bacteremia.
   #  Back Pain: NSGY highly concerned for recurrence of abcess as they
   are under impression that laminectomy occured in [**2121-1-12**] when in fact
   occured in [**2119-1-12**]. Still on differential, but feel that this is the
   less likely etiology.  CT showing extensive peritoneal and
   retroperitoneal adenopathy and ? mass/abscess along pelvic wall.  LD
   elevated but not to level expected from a lymphoma.
   - underwent aspiration of pelvic collection.   Will send fluid for gram
   stain, culture, send adenopathy tissue for pathology.
   - Given GPC in blood, hard to believe pelvis is source or even a
   metastatic focus but will aspirate under CT today.
   - MRI to assess possible spinal pathology
   # Painful L toe/right elbow: ddx for this polyarthropathy includes
   seeding from GPC bacteremia vs. crystal arthropathy (as pt gives hx of
   chronically painful toe).  Will not tap the left toe, since we are
   concerned for seeding/active infection.  Will tap the elbow which is
   severely limited in range of motion.
   - started low dose colchicine and monitor for improvement.
   - the above represents possible metastatic focus
   #  Diahrrea: may be primary infection, though seems unlikely: guiaic
   positive but not melena, especially considering that Hct has [**Doctor First Name **] stable
   despite large amounts of dark stool. Given marked leukocytosis, concern
   for CDIFF. Toxin sent, neg x 2. Empiric po vanco can be stopped soon.
   # Resp Status: Tenuous with tachypnea with wide A-a gradient, but
   improved today. Tachypnea may be mediated by cytokines related to
   sepsis.  Stable this AM on room air.
   # Altered Mental Status: unclear baseline, but seems improved today.
   Alteration likely [**1-13**] severe ongoing infection. Do not suspect CNS
   involvement of infxn.
   # Tachycardia: Atrial tachyarrhtymia. Hemodynamically tolearting
   elevated rate. Rate not indicative of intravascular depletion, but will
   rate control with metoprolol 12.5-25 mg TID.  Will try to wean dilt

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abcess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). He presents with marked leukocytosis, dark diarrhea, tachypnea, atrial tachyarrhythmia, and coag positive Staph bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Coag positive staph bacteremia: The patient has a history of MRSA sepsis and presents with signs of ongoing infection. There is a concern for a line infection, but other potential sources such as spinal, oral, or pelvic fluid etiology should also be considered. Broad coverage antibiotics are being continued until speciation results are available.

2. Back Pain: The patient's back pain is concerning for recurrence of an abscess, especially with the history of a laminectomy. However, the CT scan shows extensive peritoneal and retroperitoneal adenopathy and a possible mass/abscess along the pelvic wall. Aspiration of the pelvic collection has been performed, and fluid will be sent for gram stain, culture, and adenopathy tissue for pathology.

3. Painful L toe/right elbow: The patient has polyarthropathy, which may be due to seeding from GPC bacteremia or crystal arthropathy. Range of motion of the elbow will be assessed, and aspiration will be done. Low dose colchicine has been started"

   55yo M with hx of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and
   epidural abcess secondary to IVDU presents with marked leukocytosis,
   dark diahrrea, tachypnea, atrial tachy-arrhythimia, and Coag pos Staph
   bacteremia.
   # Sepsis/Coag pos staph bacteremia: sepsis in a man with IVDA and
   multiple prior infections.  Likely suspect line infection, but have
   also considered spinal etiology, oral etiology, pelvic fluid etiology.
   Given his new GPC bacteremia, suspect IVDU Staph bacteremia.  Remains
   unclear when he last used IV drugs.
   - cont broad covg with IV vanco/zosyn/cipro until speciation results.
   UCx pending.
   - d/c
ed EJ line,
   - Put in for TEE
   - ID agrees with our w/u: image spine, IR guided aspiration of pelvic
   fluid, continue vanco for GPC bacteremia, pull the EJ.  Consider dental
   consult for his teeth as a potential source for his bacteremia.
   #  Back Pain: NSGY highly concerned for recurrence of abcess as they
   are under impression that laminectomy occured in [**2121-1-12**] when in fact
   occured in [**2119-1-12**]. Still on differential, but feel that this is the
   less likely etiology.  CT showing extensive peritoneal and
   retroperitoneal adenopathy and ? mass/abscess along pelvic wall.  LD
   elevated but not to level expected from a lymphoma.
   - underwent aspiration of pelvic collection.   Will send fluid for gram
   stain, culture, send adenopathy tissue for pathology.
   - Given GPC in blood, hard to believe pelvis is source or even a
   metastatic focus but will aspirate under CT today.
   - MRI to assess possible spinal pathology
   # Painful L toe/right elbow: ddx for this polyarthropathy includes
   seeding from GPC bacteremia vs. crystal arthropathy (as pt gives hx of
   chronically painful toe).  Will not tap the left toe, since we are
   concerned for seeding/active infection.  Will tap the elbow which is
   severely limited in range of motion.
   - started low dose colchicine and monitor for improvement.
   - the above represents possible metastatic focus
   #  Diahrrea: may be primary infection, though seems unlikely: guiaic
   positive but not melena, especially considering that Hct has [**Doctor First Name **] stable
   despite large amounts of dark stool. Given marked leukocytosis, concern
   for CDIFF. Toxin sent, neg x 2. Empiric po vanco can be stopped soon.
   # Resp Status: Tenuous with tachypnea with wide A-a gradient, but
   improved today. Tachypnea may be mediated by cytokines related to
   sepsis.  Stable this AM on room air.
   # Altered Mental Status: unclear baseline, but seems improved today.
   Alteration likely [**1-13**] severe ongoing infection. Do not suspect CNS
   involvement of infxn.
   # Tachycardia: Atrial tachyarrhtymia. Hemodynamically tolearting
   elevated rate. Rate not indicative of intravascular depletion, but will

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). He presents with marked leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic abscess. The patient has been treated with vancomycin and his white blood cell count is trending down. The plan is to continue vancomycin and attempt to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) while the patient is intubated for MRI tomorrow. The patient also needs to have a pelvic drain placed due to MRSA growing out of his abscess. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia/MRSA pelvic abscess: The presence of MRSA bacteremia indicates a risk of spreading infection throughout the body, potentially leading to sepsis or organ dysfunction. The patient's condition requires close monitoring for any signs of deterioration.
2. Back pain/Epidural abscess: The patient has a history of epidural abscess secondary to IVDU. Aspirates from the pelvic abscess are growing MRSA, which may indicate involvement of the epidural space. An MRI of the spine tomorrow will help reassess the situation.
3. Painful left toe/right elbow: The patient has pain in the left toe and right elbow, with the right elbow having a chronic ununited fracture of the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic ununited fracture of the posterior aspect of the olecranon. He was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and was found to have bacteremia, intravenous drug abuse, knowledge deficit, back pain, atrial flutter, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/54 mmHg to 122/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, lorazepam, and others. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of creatinine, total carbon dioxide, glucose, lactate, and lactic acid. The patient's physical examination reveals scattered mid inspiratory crackles in the chest and better passive range of motion of the right elbow. The patient has an abscess in the pelvis, possibly communicating with an epidural abscess, and will require repeat MR imaging with contrast. The patient's code status is unknown, and their disposition is pending further evaluation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and signs of infection suggest a possible sepsis, which can lead to systemic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abcess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). He presents with marked leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection. The patient's condition is complicated by several issues including bacteremia, IVDU, knowledge deficit, back pain, gastrointestinal bleed, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MRSA sepsis and currently has bacteremia, indicating a high risk of sepsis. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial tachyarrhythmia, specifically atrial flutter. This condition can cause an irregular heart rhythm and may increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, or other cardiovascular complications.
3. MRSA Infection: The patient has an MRSA pelvic infection, which can be challenging to treat due to the resistance of MRSA to many antibiotics. If the infection spreads or does not respond to treatment, it can lead to further complications.
4. Back Pain: The patient's back pain could be related to an epidural abscess or phlegmon. If left untreated, this condition can lead to neurological complications, such as nerve compression or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use. He presents with marked leukocytosis, dark diarrhea, tachypnea, atrial tachyarrhythmia, and coag positive Staph bacteremia. The patient has several ongoing medical issues including bacteremia, intravenous drug abuse, knowledge deficit, back pain, atrial flutter, and gastrointestinal bleed. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and is scheduled for an MRI and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) under elective intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MRSA sepsis and is currently showing signs of bacteremia. This indicates that he may be at risk for developing sepsis again, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. MRSA Infection: The patient's abscess culture is growing MRSA, indicating an ongoing infection. If the infection spreads or does not respond to treatment, it can lead to further complications such as abscess formation, tissue damage, and systemic spread of infection.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has guaiac positive stools but not melena, suggesting the presence of blood in the gastrointestinal tract. This can be caused by various conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, esophageal varices, or divert"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of intravenous drug abuse. The patient underwent invasive ventilation, transesophageal echo, and magnetic resonance imaging. On the first day, the patient experienced a fever and was found to have a dorsal fracture of the 2nd MTP joint as well as a septic joint. The radiology also revealed epidural enhancement from L4-S1, edema through all soft tissues in the lower spine and psoas, rim-enhancing fluid pockets near L5-S1 sitting in the erector spinae muscle, high signal at the right half of the upper sacrum. These findings indicate diffuse inflammation and likely infection with focal areas of abscess formation. The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain relievers.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently being treated for bacteremia. The presence of a septic joint and signs of infection in the spine further increase the risk of sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central lines increase the risk of developing blood"

 BACK PAIN
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   55 yo male with hx of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and
   epidural abcess secondary to IVDU presents with marked leukocytosis,
   atrial tachy-arrhythimia, Coag pos Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic
   infection.
   # Staph Bacteremia/MRSA pelvic infection
   - pt
s original blood cx and aspirate from pt
s pelvic infxn both
   growing MRSA
   - WBC trending down, but febrile again o/n
   - will continue vancomycin
   - consider additional broad spectrum ABx
   - TEE normal and without vegetations
   - will d/w surgery re: Rx for pelvic infection and whether this is
   communicating with epidural abscess.
   #  Back Pain
   - aspirate from pelvic infxn growing MRSA
 pt is on vanc
   - prior images suspicious for epidural phlegmon or abscess
   - mf/u MRI shows: epidural enhancement from L4-S1, edema thru all soft
   tissue in lower spine and psoas, rim enhancing fluid pockets near L5-S1
   sitting in erector spinae muscle, high signal at right half of upper
   sacrum. overall diffuse inflammation and likely infection with focal
   areas of abscess formation. the cauda equina appears unusual (?
   arachnoiditis). very likely that this inflammation is tracking out of
   sacral foramina and into pre-sacral soft tissue
   # Painful L toe/right elbow
   - started low dose colchicine without improvement
   - L toe appears fluctuant and will get I and D after confirming
   fluctuance with US
   - ortho was unable to get fluid out of elbow yesterday
   -U/S of upper extremity done - no DVT, soft tissue edema; also got
   plain films showing chronic ununited frx of the posterior aspect of the
   olecranon
   #  Diahrrea
   - c.diff was negative x 3
 will stop PO vanc
   - pt with guaiac positive stools but not melena
 will continue to
   monitor hct daily
   # Resp Status: previous tachypnea with wide A-a gradient, but improved
   today. Tachypnea may be mediated by cytokines related to sepsis.
   Stable on vent this AM, oxygenating and ventilating well.
   - no acute issues at this time
   # Anemia
 Hct 28 to 26 this AM.  Does not appear to be dilutional.
   - will guiac stools, q 8 Hct x 3, order for T&C.
   - GI following.
   # Altered Mental Status: unclear baseline, but seems improved today.
   Alteration likely [**1-13**] severe ongoing infection. Do not suspect CNS
   involvement of infxn.
   - continue to monitor for any acute mental status changes
   # Tachycardia
   - pt is on diltiazem gtt
 have transitioned to PO
   # FEN: NPO after MN for procedures tomorrow
   # Access: pt with one peripheral IV (20 gauge).  Other IV was removed
   by pt.  EJ was pulled.  Will place CVL today and consider A line.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   Critical Care:
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 7646**] is in exquisite pain from his RUE and left toe. MRI findings
   noted and conveyed to neurosurgical colleagues. He has extensive
   findings from L4-S1 with features of arachnoiditis and epidural
   collection. Podiatry staff have seen and prefer to debride in OR too.
   WBC os 30.7 K, creat now 1.1 and ABG with Ph of 7.37
   He remains on pressors and fentany/versed. He is understanding of
   simple commands and even the need for surgery while intubated. He
   remains febrile but hemodynamically no worse. He will need to proceed
   to the OR once neurosurgical staff have obtained consent. He may need
   to extubate for this but I am concerned with his pain control, there
   may be a very short window to do so. We will co-ordinate efforts on
   this front, continue high dose IV Vanco and dose per levels.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). He presents with leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag-positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection. The patient's current condition includes bacteremia, IVDU, back pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and altered mental status. He has been intubated and is on invasive ventilation. The patient has undergone several procedures and investigations, including transesophageal echo (TEE), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and blood cultures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MRSA sepsis and is currently febrile with leukocytosis. There is a risk of progression to septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Organ Dysfunction: Although the patient is currently without organ dysfunction, his altered mental status and respiratory issues may progress and lead to organ dysfunction.
3. Infection Spread: The presence of coag-positive Staph bacteremia suggests the possibility of infection spreading to other sites in the body.
4. Abscess Formation: The MRI findings indicate the presence of an epidural abscess, which can potentially lead to further complications if not addressed.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has guaiac positive stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding."

   communicating with epidural abscess.
   #  Back Pain
   - aspirate from pelvic infxn growing MRSA
 pt is on vanc
   - prior images suspicious for epidural phlegmon or abscess
   - mf/u MRI shows: epidural enhancement from L4-S1, edema thru all soft
   tissue in lower spine and psoas, rim enhancing fluid pockets near L5-S1
   sitting in erector spinae muscle, high signal at right half of upper
   sacrum. overall diffuse inflammation and likely infection with focal
   areas of abscess formation. the cauda equina appears unusual (?
   arachnoiditis). very likely that this inflammation is tracking out of
   sacral foramina and into pre-sacral soft tissue

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). He presents with marked leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection. The patient has several medical complications including bacteremia, IVDU, back pain, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, painful left toe and right elbow, diarrhea, respiratory status, anemia, altered mental status, tachycardia, and poor glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has coag positive Staph bacteremia and MRSA pelvic infection. It is important to continue vancomycin and consider adding rifampin if a second broad-spectrum antibiotic is needed.
2. Intravenous Drug Abuse (IVDA): The patient has a history of IVDU which may have led to the development of MRSA sepsis and epidural abscess.
3. Back Pain: The patient has back pain with MRI findings showing epidural enhancement from L4-S1, edema through all soft tissues in the lower spine and psoas, rim-enhancing fluid pockets near L5-S1, and high signal at the right half of the upper sacrum. This suggests inflammation and likely infection with focal areas of abscess formation.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abcess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). The patient presents with marked leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection.

The patient has multiple medical complications and ongoing infections. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient has a history of MRSA sepsis and currently has bacteremia with coag positive Staphylococcus. If the infection spreads to other organs, it can lead to sepsis with organ dysfunction.

2. MRSA pelvic infection: The patient has an active MRSA infection in the pelvic area. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this infection may worsen, leading to further complications.

3. Back pain and potential epidural abscess: The patient has back pain, and imaging studies suggest the presence of an epidural phlegmon or abscess. This condition can cause compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina, leading to neurological deficits.

4. Painful toe and elbow: The patient has pain in the left toe and right elbow. The toe appears fluctuant, indicating a potential abscess. The chronic ununited fracture of the olecranon may also contribute to the pain and potential complications.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). The patient presents with marked leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Staph Bacteremia/MRSA pelvic infection: The patient's blood culture and pelvic infection aspirate both grew MRSA. Vancomycin will be continued, and consideration may be given to adding a second broad-spectrum antibiotic like rifampin to identify the specific pathogen.
2. Back Pain: The patient has an epidural enhancement from L4-S1, edema through all soft tissues in the lower spine and psoas, rim-enhancing fluid pockets near L5-S1 sitting in the erector spinae muscle, high signal at the right half of the upper sacrum. This indicates diffuse inflammation and likely infection with focal areas of abscess formation. The cauda equina appears unusual (possibly arachnoiditis). It is likely that this inflammation is tracking out of sacral foramina and into pre-sacral soft tissue.
3. Painful Left toe/right elbow: The patient's left toe appears fluctuant and will undergo incision and drainage (I&D) after confirming fluctuance with ultrasound. The right elbow is"

The patient presents with marked leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MRSA sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation and infection throughout the body. This can result in septic shock and organ dysfunction.

2. Atrial Flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial tachyarrhythmia, specifically atrial flutter. This condition can increase the risk of stroke and heart failure if not properly managed.

3. Staphylococcal Bacteremia: The patient has coag positive Staph bacteremia, indicating the presence of Staphylococcus bacteria in the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis and infective endocarditis.

4. MRSA Infection: The patient has an MRSA pelvic infection, which can cause localized infection and abscess formation. This may require surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy.

5. Back Pain: The patient is experiencing back pain, which could be due to epidural phlegmon or abscess, as suggested by the MRI findings. This can lead to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess, presenting with marked leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection. The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, back pain, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing infection can lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by an overwhelming immune response to infection.
2. MRSA Infection: The presence of MRSA bacteremia and pelvic infection indicates the risk of further complications related to antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers and wound infections.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The guaiac positive stools suggest gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require further investigation and management.
5. Back Pain: The epidural phlegmon or abscess seen on MRI could contribute to the patient's back pain and may require intervention.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's unclear baseline mental status and recent improvement could be due to severe ongoing infection or other neurological complications.
7. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be related to sepsis, pain, or medication effects.
8. Respiratory Status: The previous tachypnea with a wide A-a gradient indicates respiratory compromise, which needs close monitoring, especially during extubation considerations.
9. Anemia: The decreasing hemoglobin levels suggest anemia, which requires further evaluation and management.
10. Potential CNS Involvement: Although the altered mental status is attributed to severe ongoing infection, monitoring for any acute mental status changes is essential.

Please note that the patient's medical history and current condition are complex, and this summary does not cover all possible complications. Continuous monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage the patient's condition effectively."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). The patient presents with leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection. The patient has been febrile again yesterday and will continue on vancomycin, with a trough level of 33, so the dose will be held. There is suspicion of a possible second bacterial infection, and the physician would like to identify it. The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), which showed no vegetations. Daily cultures have been ordered, and the vancomycin trough level will be monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient has a history of MRSA sepsis, and currently presents with signs of infection, including leukocytosis and bacteremia. There is a risk of developing sepsis with organ dysfunction if the infection is not controlled.

2. MRSA Infection: The patient has an MRSA pelvic infection, which requires ongoing treatment with vancomycin. If the infection is not effectively managed, it could lead to complications such as abscess formation or systemic spread of the infection.

3. Atrial Flutter: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, which may be related to the ongoing infection and inflammation. It is important"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abcess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). He presents with leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection. The patient has several medical complications including impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has ongoing infections and impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of further infections and delayed wound healing.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has coag positive Staph bacteremia and MRSA pelvic infection. This indicates an ongoing infection and the possibility of spreading bacteria throughout the body.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has guaiac positive stools but not melena. This suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which requires further investigation and monitoring.
4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic infection that can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly.
5. Altered mental status: The patient has an unclear baseline mental status but seems improved. Ongoing infection and sepsis can cause alterations in mental status, and close monitoring is necessary for any acute changes.
6. Back pain: The patient has back pain with imaging showing epidural enhancement, edema, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess, likely due to intravenous drug use (IVDU). He presents with leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, positive coagulation for Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Staph Bacteremia/MRSA pelvic infection: The patient's blood culture and aspirate from the pelvic infection are growing MRSA. This indicates a potential ongoing infection that requires appropriate antibiotic treatment.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, likely due to poor oral intake and lack of feeding. It is recommended to give D5W to address this electrolyte imbalance.

3. Back Pain: The patient has back pain, which may be related to epidural phlegmon or abscess. An MRI shows epidural enhancement from L4-S1, edema through all soft tissue in the lower spine and psoas, rim-enhancing fluid pockets near L5-S1, and high signal at the right half of the upper sacrum. These findings suggest diffuse inflammation and likely infection with focal areas of abscess formation.

4. Painful Left Toe/Right Elbow: The patient has painful toes and an elbow, which could be due to various causes such as diabetic foot, gout, or joint infection. Further evaluation,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use. He presents with marked leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coagulase-positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection. The patient has several medical complications, including impaired airway protection, impaired skin integrity, bacteremia, intravenous drug abuse, knowledge deficit, back pain, atrial flutter, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired airway protection: The patient has an inability to protect his airway, which can lead to aspiration and respiratory complications.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has large amounts of subcutaneous edema in the right upper extremity and a small enhancing elbow joint effusion, indicating potential skin breakdown and risk of infection.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has coagulase-positive Staph bacteremia, indicating the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream, which can lead to sepsis and various organ dysfunctions.
4. Intravenous drug abuse (IVDA): The patient's history of IVDU increases the risk of infections, including MRSA infections, and can contribute to other complications such as impaired skin integrity and bacteremia.
5. Knowledge deficit: The patient's knowledge deficit may increase the risk of non-adherence to treatment plans and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use (IVDU). The patient presents with marked leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MRSA sepsis, which is a serious systemic infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially progress to septic shock.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has coag positive Staph bacteremia, indicating the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream. This can lead to further infections in different organs or tissues.

3. MRSA pelvic infection: The patient has an MRSA infection in the pelvic area. This can be a challenging infection to treat due to the resistance of MRSA to commonly used antibiotics.

4. Back pain: The patient has back pain, which may be related to an epidural phlegmon or abscess. This could potentially lead to neurological complications if not properly managed.

5. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has guaiac positive stools but not melena. This indicates the presence of blood in the stool, which could be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess due to intravenous drug use. He presents with leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coagulase-positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection. The patient's original blood culture and aspirate from the pelvic infection both grew MRSA. He has a WBC trending down, but he is febrile again. The patient is on vancomycin, and his dose has been held due to a high trough level. 

The patient has several medical complications, including impaired skin integrity, bacteremia, intravenous drug abuse, knowledge deficit, back pain, atrial flutter, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, painful left toe/right elbow, diarrhea, altered mental status, anemia, tachycardia, and inability to protect airway.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/71 mmHg to 147/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abscess secondary to intravenous drug use. He presents with leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection. The patient's blood culture and pelvic infection aspirate grew MRSA. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has shown improvement in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia/MRSA pelvic infection: The patient has a confirmed MRSA infection in his pelvic area. This infection needs to be treated aggressively with appropriate antibiotics to prevent further complications.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is an imbalance of sodium levels in the blood. It should be monitored and managed appropriately to prevent any neurological complications.

3. Back pain: The patient has back pain, and staples from a previous surgery will be removed on [**2121-7-3**]. There is also an aspirate from the pelvic infection growing MRSA, which requires further evaluation and treatment.

4. Painful L toe/right elbow: The patient has pain in his left toe and right elbow. The painful right elbow is due to a chronic ununited fracture of the posterior aspect of the olecranon. This condition should be managed appropriately to prevent further complications.

He presents with marked leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough)
2. Impaired skin integrity
3. Bacteremia
4. Intravenous drug abuse (IVDA)
5. Knowledge deficit
6. Back pain
7. Atrial flutter (AFLUTTER)
8. Gastrointestinal bleed, other (GI bleed, GIB)
9. Sepsis without organ dysfunction

The patient has several ongoing medical issues:

   - The patient's original blood culture and aspirate from the pelvic infection and foot wound grew MRSA.
   - The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, but they are still febrile.
   - According to the ID doctor, continue the course with Vancomycin.
   - The patient has a TEE that is normal and without vegetations.

   -CT showed small joint effusion/small (1cm) amount of fluid in biceps
   muscle without large collections or evidence of osteo.
    #  Diahrrea
   - c.diff was negative x 3
 stopped PO [**Name (NI) 2601**]
   - pt with guaiac positive stools but not melena
 will continue to
   monitor hct daily
   # Resp Status: previous tachypnea with wide A-a gradient. Tachypnea may
   be mediated by cytokines related to sepsis.  Stable on vent this AM,
   oxygenating and ventilating well; much improved response
   -extubation today
   -keep -1L to -2L today because of persistant lung window pathology
   # Anemia
 Hct decreased.
   - recheck H/H today, transfusion threshold <21.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MRSA sepsis secondary to joint infections and epidural abcess secondary to intravenous drug use. He presents with leukocytosis, atrial tachyarrhythmia, coag positive Staph bacteremia, and MRSA pelvic infection. The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired airway protection, impaired skin integrity, bacteremia, intravenous drug abuse, knowledge deficit, back pain, atrial flutter, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Pressure ulcers: Impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, especially in critically ill patients who are immobile.
3. Sepsis: The patient already has bacteremia and a history of sepsis, which can worsen if not properly managed.
4. Intravenous drug abuse: The patient's history of intravenous drug abuse puts him at risk for further complications related to drug use.
5. Knowledge deficit: The patient may have a knowledge deficit regarding his condition and treatment plan, which can affect compliance and outcomes.
6. Back pain: The patient's back pain may be due to an epidural phlegmon or abscess, which can cause discomfort and potentially worsen if"
