   Assessment and Plan
   STATUS EPILEPTICUS -- attributed to underlying meningoencephalitis.
   Possible component of EtOH withdrawal/DT.  Medication related (although
   Toxin screen negative at admission).  Clinical seizures responded to
   benzodiazepines.  Tolerated Dilantin iv load --> need to F/U blood
   level.  Plan urgent EEG to evaluate for non-convulsive status.  If OK,
   then proceed to head MRI/MRA/MRV, and repeat LP.  Plan for intubation
   in preparation of MRI studies.  Maintain seizure precautions.
   Neurology to F/U.
   MENINGOENCEPHALITIS -- unclear etiology; possible viral (or late
   bacterial) with lymphocyte predominance.  Continue antimicrobials and
   antiviral empirically.  Reassess need for steroids.
   H/O EtOH -- Concern for possible withdrawal.  Monitor CIWA scale -->
   prn valium per scale.
   FLUIDS -- euvolemic.  Monitor I/O, maintain balance.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to status epilepticus.  Now
   post-ictal vs. non-convulsive status.  Evaluation (EEG, MRI/MRA/MRV,
   LP) as per Neurology.
   NUTRITIONAL STATUS -- NPO pending evaluation.
   RENAL FUNCITON -- preserved.  Monitor BUN, creat, I/O.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of status epilepticus. The patient's history indicates meningoencephalitis, although the exact cause is unclear. The patient has been receiving various medications including iv ativan, iv valium, and iv Dilantin. He remains non-communicative and unable to attend, but is able to move all four extremities non-purposefully. The patient has no known drug allergies and has been given acyclovir and ceftriaxone as antibiotics. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/90 mmHg to 179/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen delivery. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of malnutrition. The patient's cardiovascular system is normal, with no murmurs or irregularities noted. The respiratory system is clear, with no wheezes or crackles. The patient has no lymphadenopathy or edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. 

Plan:
The patient's assessment includes ongoing management of status epilepticus and meningoencephalitis. An urgent EEG"

   Imaging
   [**2115-6-22**] MRI: (prelim) diffuse high signal cerebral sulci and cerebellar
   folia on FLAIR images may be realted to known meningitis, recent LP or
   combination.  No evidence of cerebritis, intra-axial or extra-axial
   abscess.  Non specific T2 hyperintensities in supra tentorial white
   matter----may be related to vasculitis, demyelination, Lyme disease,
   sarcoidosis or other inflammatory process.  No evidence of DVT.  2-mm
   aneurysm vs infundibulum in supraclinoid left internal carotid artery.
   Recommend further eval by CTA and follow up MRI after resolution of
   meningoencephalitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with presumed viral meningoencephalitis and status epilepticus. She has been receiving treatment with acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. The patient's condition remains unstable, and she continues to require close monitoring and aggressive treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has experienced status epilepticus and may be at risk for recurrent seizures. Continuous EEG monitoring is being performed to characterize the epileptogenic focus and guide further management.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient is on invasive ventilation support and may be at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count (117,000 -> 129,000), which could be due to bone marrow suppression from viral infection or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further monitoring and investigation are required to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. HIV infection: The patient's abnormal T-cell subsets, including low CD3 and CD4 levels, raise concerns for HIV infection. However, these findings may also be explained by an ongoing infection. An HIV test should be pursued when the patient is able to consent.
5. Thrombotic events: The presence of a 2-mm aneurysm in the supraclinoid left"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with presumed viral meningoencephalitis, who presented with status epilepticus and was transferred to the ICU. She is currently on antiepileptic medication (Dilantin) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ampicillin and Vancomycin). The patient's HIV consent is pending. She underwent an MRI and lumbar puncture, both of which showed no significant abnormalities. Blood cultures are pending. The patient's condition remains critical, and she requires close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of status epilepticus, and there is a risk of recurrent seizures. Continuous monitoring and prompt treatment are essential.
2. Infection: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's meningoencephalitis could be caused by viral, bacterial, fungal, or atypical pathogens. Monitoring for any signs of infection and adjusting the treatment accordingly is crucial.
3. HIV infection: The patient's HIV status is unknown, and further testing is pending. If the patient is HIV positive, it may impact the choice of antibiotics and antiviral therapy.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to bone marrow suppression caused by viral infection or other factors. Close monitoring of platelet levels and appropriate management is necessary.

   disturbance (Na, Ca, Mg, gluc), stroke, septic emboli, cerebral
   hypoxia, medication effect, temporal lobe epilepsy, acute HTN; no mass,
   bleed seen on CT
   -dilantin load 1400 mg (20 mg/kg), dilatin level pending; monitor on
   tele for arrhythmia

   [**Doctor First Name 1871**], EEE) vs. atypical bacterial (lyme, syphillis, TB) vs. fungal
   (toxo) vs. aseptic (NSAIDs); must consider bacterial meningitis in late

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with presumed viral meningoencephalitis who was transferred to the ICU for management of status epilepticus. She has been started on ampicillin and vancomycin, and dilantin has been loaded. The patient's condition remains unstable with intermittent seizures, fever, and altered mental status. Imaging studies show no evidence of cerebritis, abscess, or DVT, but there is a 2-mm aneurysm in the left internal carotid artery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient experienced status epilepticus and continues to have intermittent seizures. It is important to monitor for seizure recurrence and manage accordingly.
2. Airway compromise: Due to altered mental status and potential airway obstruction, close monitoring is necessary, and intubation may be required if necessary.
3. Infection: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's condition suggests a possible viral or atypical bacterial etiology. Cultures are pending, and further evaluation is needed.
4. HIV infection: The patient's low CD3 and CD4 counts raise concerns for HIV infection. An HIV test should be pursued when the patient can consent.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be explained by BM suppression or HIT. Close monitoring is required, and further evaluation is needed.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with presumed viral meningoencephalitis and status epilepticus. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for management. 

24-hour events include restarting Vanc, starting on Dilantin, and obtaining HIV consent. Lab orders have been placed and will likely be processed on Monday. The patient underwent an EEG, invasive ventilation for sedation during MRI and LP, and was successfully extubated in the morning. 

The patient's fever is currently at 102.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Allergies are unknown, and the last doses of antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, Acyclovir, and Vancomycin) were administered at different times overnight. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/60 to 175/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,969 mL with 413 mL given intravenously. The patient has had a significant output of 3,491 mL, including 310 mL of urine output. 

The patient's neurological examination indicates agitation, open eyes to voice, and no reliable command-following. There are no focal weaknesses, and pupils are unequal with sluggish response to light.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a diagnosis of meningoencephalitis, complicated by seizures (status epilepticus). They were intubated for airway protection but have now been successfully extubated. The patient's respiratory failure, seizures, and fever are attributed to the meningeal inflammation. They are currently on continuous EEG monitoring and have been prescribed antiepileptic medication (Dilantin) to control seizures.

The patient's reduced CD4 count raises concerns about HIV risks, and an HIV test is pending. No localizing signs of other causes have been observed so far, but the patient is being monitored for any changes. Leptomeninigitis is suspected to be viral, and acyclovir has been initiated while awaiting HSV PCR results. Empirical antimicrobials are also being continued until cultures are obtained.

The patient's fluid status is euvolemic, but insensible losses due to fever are being accounted for with IV fluids. Renal function is preserved, and urine output, BUN, and creatinine levels are being monitored. Nutritional support is currently not being provided orally, but total parenteral nutrition (TF) is being considered.

The patient requires close ICU care, including prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Central venous access is necessary due to the need for a central line. The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   Meningoencephalitis, complicated by seizures (status epilepticus).
   Respiratory failure -- intubated for airway protection.  Now
   successfully extubated.  Monitor airway patency, RR & SaO2.
   Seizures -- likely due to meningeal inflammation.  Currently controlled
   while on Dilantin --> follow level.  Seizure & aspiration precautions.
   Reduced CD4 count -- clinical concern for HIV risks --> HIV test
   pending (consent obtained previously)
   Fever -- attributed to CNS infection.  Continue to survey for other
   causes in ICU pt, although currently no localizing signs.  F/U LFT's,
   amylase, lipase.  Monitor for C. diff.
   Leptomeninigitis -- probable viral, would continue acyclovir (HSV PCR
   pending), but continue empirical antimicrobials.  Await cultures.
   Fluids -- euvolemic, but insensible losses with fever.  Provide iv
   fluids.  Follow I/O, maintain balance.
   Renal function -- preserved.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creatitine.
   Nutritional support -- NPO.  Consider initiating TF.
   IV Access -- consider PICC.  [**Month (only) 60**] need central line.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of seizures and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with meningoencephalitis, complicated by seizures (status epilepticus). They were intubated for respiratory failure but are now successfully extubated.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 102.6Â°F (39.2Â°C), with a current temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.1Â°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/71 to 175/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has a history of immunocompromised state, and there are concerns for HIV risks, for which an HIV test is pending. The patient is also receiving treatment for presumed viral leptomeninigitis with acyclovir and empirical antimicrobials.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating an ongoing infection or inflammation. The platelet count is within normal range, but other lab values such as hemoglobin, creatinine, and blood glucose levels are slightly abnormal.

The patient has been placed on seizure precautions and is being monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress or deterioration. They are also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, so prophylactic measures are"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for presumed viral meningoencephalitis and management of status epilepticus. The patient's mental status improved overnight, and there is no evidence of seizure activity on EEG. She is currently on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, with a target therapeutic level of 10-20 mcg/mL. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 113/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2444 mL and output of 2120 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 324 mL. The patient's weight is currently 63 kg, and her height is 67 inches. Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood chemistry shows slightly elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and magnesium, but within normal limits. The patient's electrolytes and kidney function are being closely monitored.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's presumed diagnosis is HSV-2 viral meningoencephalitis, with consideration of ethanol withdrawal. Other potential causes such as metabolic disturbances, stroke, septic emboli, cerebral hypoxia, medication effects"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of presumed viral meningoencephalitis, admitted to the ICU for management of status epilepticus. The patient's mental status has improved, with increased alertness and less somnolence. There have been no seizures overnight. A herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection was confirmed in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample yesterday. The team increased the dose of acyclovir and discontinued vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

Medical Complications:
1. HSV-2 Meningoencephalitis: The patient has confirmed HSV-2 infection in the CSF, which indicates a potential medical complication. Acyclovir therapy has been initiated to treat the viral infection.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, but there are no signs of bleeding. Possible causes include bone marrow suppression due to viral infection or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Monitoring of platelet levels and further investigation is necessary.
3. HIV Infection: The patient's abnormal T-cell subset with low CD3, CD4, and CD8 levels raises concern for HIV infection. However, this may be explained by the ongoing infection. HIV testing has been ordered, and the patient's consent for HIV testing was obtained from the daughter.
4. Hypovolemic Status: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28.5 kg (admission weight) and 67-inch height female with a current weight of 63 kg. She is currently intubated but was extubated yesterday. The patient has been diagnosed with status epilepticus and encephalitis. She is interacting well with the nursing staff and has not experienced any further seizures since June 20th, 2115. Antibiotics were stopped except for acyclovir, which the patient continues to receive. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3Â°C (97.4Â°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/70 to 129/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological examination reveals normal findings, and she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Her blood work shows slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but other lab values are within normal range. Imaging reveals normal lung volumes, no infiltrates or effusions, and a normal heart size. The patient's assessment includes ongoing care for status epilepticus and encephalitis, low CD4 count, and plans to continue antiepileptics, advance diet, replete calcium, and consider HIV testing when her sensorium improves. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon."
