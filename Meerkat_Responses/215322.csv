   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female who was admitted with nausea and chest tightness. She has been diagnosed with urosepsis, chronic heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, and a possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C (97.9 F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/78 mmHg to 103/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

The physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, trace lower extremity edema, and a systolic murmur. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, mild anemia, increased creatinine level, and high blood glucose levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
- Gram-negative rod bacteremia, likely representing urosepsis, for which she will receive broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with cefepime.
- Stress dose hydrocortisone will be initiated due to chronic steroid use.
- Fluids will be held for now due to CHF.
- Follow-up urine culture sensitivities, blood culture speciation, liver function tests, and Clostridium difficile tests will be done.
- Coronary artery disease: The patient likely suffered"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, presenting with nausea, chest tightness, and subsequent diagnosis of Gram-negative rod bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She is currently stable in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GNR Bacteremia: The patient has a diagnosis of Gram-negative rod bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed. Continuous administration of cefepime is recommended to treat the infection.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%. She may be experiencing an acute exacerbation of her heart failure, possibly related to the recent NSTEMI. Diuresis with IV lasix and an echocardiogram to assess changes in systolic function are planned.
3. Possible NSTEMI: The patient's symptoms of chest tightness and changes in cardiac enzymes suggest a possible NSTEMI. She is already on anticoagulation therapy with heparin and antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel). Further management will include continuation of these medications and consideration for transfusion.
4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, as indicated by her baseline creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL."

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a chief complaint of nausea, chest tightness, and recent hospitalization for GNR bacteremia, UTI, and possible NSTEMI. She is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient's medical history includes systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, poorly controlled diabetes, polymyalgia rheumatica, and chronic renal failure. She also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not anticoagulated.

The patient's current medications include ceftriaxone, furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium, metoprolol, and stress-dose steroids. She is also on a cardiac, diabetic diet, and her glycemic control is being monitored.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F) at maximum and 35.6°C (96°F) currently.
- Heart rate: 65 beats per minute with a normal sinus rhythm.
- Blood pressure: 101/54 mmHg at minimum and 98/42 mmHg at maximum.
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute.
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, trace lower extremity edema, and a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border without radiation. Her abdominal examination is"

","The patient is an elderly woman with a history of systolic heart failure and a recent episode of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She presented with nausea, chest tightness, and was found to have Gram-negative rod bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and possible NSTEMI. The likely source of the bacteremia was the bladder, and there is no evidence of septic shock. Treatment was narrowed from cefepime to ceftriaxone, and she will likely need a 14-day course of antibiotics starting from [**10-24**]. She can probably go home on oral antibiotics (e.g., cipro), but will continue with intravenous ceftriaxone while in the hospital. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, and there is no evidence of a biliary source.

The patient's stress-dose steroids were discontinued given her stability, and she will resume her home dose. Blood culture specification is planned. The patient likely suffered an NSTEMI, as evidenced by her EKG on admission, which showed unchanged findings. However, her cardiac enzymes peaked at 232, MB 20, MBI 6.7, and now her CK is trending down to 202, MB 9, Troponin 0.97. The patient is currently chest pain-free.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old female who presented with nausea and chest tightness. She was found to have gram-negative rod bacteremia, likely representing urosepsis given the positive urine culture for E. coli. She also had a possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), as indicated by her EKG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20% and is currently experiencing an acute-on-chronic episode, which may be related to the recent NSTEMI. Her fluid status is difficult to assess due to the urosepsis picture. The patient is also experiencing acute-on-chronic renal failure, with a urine sodium fraction of 8%, suggesting intrinsic renal damage rather than pre-renal failure. She has poorly controlled diabetes, likely secondary to the UTI. The patient is on chronic steroids and will require stress dose steroids. She is currently being treated with cefepime for the bacteremia, stress-dose steroids, heparin for NSTEMI, and diuretics for fluid management. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial
   pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
   The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global
   left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). No masses or thrombi are
   seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral
   Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
   (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size is
   normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
   suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
   pressure. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-8-13**], the left
   ventricular systolic function is similar and the severities of mitral

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a chief complaint of nausea and chest tightness. She was found to have gram-negative rod bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The likely source of bacteremia was the bladder, and no evidence of septic picture was observed. Narrowing from cefepime to ceftriaxone was done, with a planned 14-day course of antibiotics.

The patient likely suffered from NSTEMI, with an unchanged EKG on admission but peaked CK, MB, and MBI levels. The patient is now chest pain-free. Heparin gtt was given for a 48-hour course, and the patient will continue with ASA, statin, and Plavix. Beta-blocker therapy was started as the patient is not at hypotensive risk.

The patient has a history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure (HF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%. The acute on chronic episode may have been related to the recent NSTEMI. The patient appears euvolemic and will be restarted on home Lasix. Metoprolol at 12.5 mg was initiated, and discussion about ACE inhibitor with the primary cardiologist will take place. An ECHO will be done to assess for any changes in systolic function. PT consult was also ordered.

   The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial
   pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
   The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global
   left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). No masses or thrombi are
   seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral
   Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
   (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size is
   normal. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
   suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
   pressure. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-8-13**], the left
   ventricular systolic function is similar and the severities of mitral
   regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation (TR [**1-15**]+) have worsened.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 yo F who presents with nausea, chest tightness found to GNR
   bacteremia, UTI, and possible NSTEMI
   .
   #Gram Neg Rod Bacteremia: Likely source was bladder.  No evidence for
   septic picture, likely from early treatment.
   - Narrowed from cefepime to ceftriaxone.  Will likely need a 14 day
   course from [**10-24**] but can probably go home on PO antibiotics (eg,
   cipro).  Will continue ceftriaxone while in house.  LFTs improving.  No
   evidence of billiary source.
   - D/C stress-dose steroids given stability.  Resume home dose.
   - f/u blood culture speciation
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt likely suffered NSTEMI, her EKG on admission as
   unchanged, however CK peaked 232, MB 20, MBI 6.7.  CK now trending down
   202, MB 9, Trop 0.97. Pt is chest pain free.
   -heparin gtt for 48 hour course complete.
   -Continue asa, statin and plavix
   -start beta-blocker as not at hypotensive risk.
   .
   # PUMP: Pt having acute on chronic systolic HF. Hx of systolic HF with
   EF 20%. Acute on chronic episode may be [**2-15**] NSTEMI.
   -will diurese today with goal 1-2L negative.
   -Start metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], will discuss ACE with primary cardiologist.
   -ECHO to assess for any changes in systolic function
   - PT consult
   .
   # RHYTHM: paced, not anticoagulated for AF
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Continues to improve
   -will cont to follow
   .
   # Diabetes: poorly controlled likely secondary to UTI in setting of
   steroids
   - resume home regimen of NPH 18 QAM and 8 QPM.
   .
   # PMR: on steroids at home, will initiate stress dose steroids
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet, no diuretics for now given low bp likely
   [**2-15**] sepsis, monitor and replete lytes
   .
   # ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin gtt, bowel regimen for constipation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a chief complaint of nausea and chest tightness. She has been diagnosed with GNR bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's medical history includes chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, acute on chronic renal failure, poorly controlled diabetes, polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and femoral neck fracture (FEN).

The patient's current medications include aspirin (ASA), statin, Plavix, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor (which previously caused hypotension), diuretic, and other ICU medications such as furosemide (Lasix) and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/53 to 116/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is paced and not anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation (AF).

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and mildly elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab results, including electrolytes, liver function tests, and cardiac enzymes, are within normal range or show"
