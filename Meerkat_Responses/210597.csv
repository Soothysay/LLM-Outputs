   Assessment and Plan
   54 year-old female with history of alcohol abuse, status post
   splenectomy, status post multiple abdominal surgeries initially
   presenting with altered mental status and dyspnea, with subsequent
   asystolic arrest for 26 minutes and multiple laboratory abnormalities,
   including significant bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated
   lactate.
   * Sepsis: Unclear etiology - patient is status post splenectomy and
   therefore immunocompromised. Initial laboratories significant for WBC
   12.9 with 32% bandemia with increasing WBC. Concern for catastrophic
   abdominal event given gas distended bowel loops and recent complaints
   of abdominal pain. Initial chest x-ray and urinalysis without
   infection.
   - add on diff
   - Antibiotics with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole to
   treat likely abdominal process; vanc level tonight
   - f/u blood, sputum, urine, stool cultures pending
   - Surgery following; appreciate
   - check CXR after advancing OG tube
   - KUB stat to loook for free air
   - consider CT torso
   - check c. difficile if pt stools
   * Status post arrest: The patient had a 26 minute asystolic arrest in
   the ED. The most likely etiologies are acidosis versus potential toxin
   ingestion. The patient was no longer hypoglycemic at the time of
   arrest. Improved neurological exam. The length of the code suggests a
   poor prognosis.
   - Initiate cooling protocol
 once complete, start weaning sedatives
   - continuous EEG
   - Stat CT head when feasible
   - Neurology consult; appreciate
   - Treatment for potential underlying etiologies as below
   * Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has renal failure, a
   significant lactic acidosis, as well as ketones likely due to
   dehydration. Her osmolar gap initially was only 11, however increased
   to 17 on repeat testing, of unclear etiology, now improved
 may have
   been due to ketosis and lactic acidosis.  Also consider profound
   thiamine deficiency.
   - appreciate tox recs
   - f/u polyethlyene glycol level and thiamine level

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, status post splenectomy, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She initially presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by an asystolic arrest for 26 minutes. The patient has multiple laboratory abnormalities, including significant bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate. She is currently in the ICU and requires various interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state due to splenectomy and laboratory findings indicate a potential septic process. She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover likely abdominal pathogens.
2. Status post arrest: The patient experienced a prolonged asystolic arrest, which can lead to poor neurological outcomes. Continuous EEG monitoring and a neurological consultation have been requested.
3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis and renal failure, which contribute to the acidosis. Evaluation for underlying causes such as thiamine deficiency is ongoing.
4. Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia is present, possibly due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or alcohol withdrawal. Close monitoring of heart rate and consideration of benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal are planned.
5. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires supportive ventilation. FiO2 has been reduced, and ABG monitoring is ongoing.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 54 year-old female with history of alcohol abuse, status post
   splenectomy, status post multiple abdominal surgeries initially
   presenting with altered mental status and dyspnea, with subsequent
   asystolic arrest for 26 minutes and multiple laboratory abnormalities,
   including significant bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated
   lactate.
   * Status post arrest: The patient had a 26 minute asystolic arrest in
   the ED. The most likely etiologies are acidosis versus potential toxin
   ingestion. The patient was no longer hypoglycemic at the time of
   arrest. Her examination at this time is significant for minimally
   responsive dilated pupils, negative gag reflex, decerebrate posturing,
   no response to pain. The length of the code suggests a poor prognosis.
   - Initiate cooling protocol
   - EEG
   - Stat CT head when feasible
   - Neurology consult; appreciate
   - Treatment for potential underlying etiologies as below
   * Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has renal failure, a
   significant lactic acidosis, as well as ketones likely due to
   dehydration. Her osmolar gap initially was only 11, however increased
   to 17 on repeat testing, of unclear etiology. Acidosis is improved on a
   bicarbonate drip.
   - IVF hydration
   - Discontinue bicarbonate drip at this time; monitor
   - Continue to monitor lactate
   - Toxicology consult; appreciate
   - Evaluation for sepsis as below
   * Sepsis: Unclear etiology - patient is status post splenectomy and
   therefore immunocompromised. Initial laboratories significant for WBC
   12.9 with 32% bandemia. Concern for catastrophic abdominal event given
   gas distended bowel loops and recent complaints of abdominal pain.
   Initial chest x-ray and urinalysis without infection.
   - Antibiosis with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole to treat
   likely abdominal process
   - Stat CT torso
   - Blood, sputum, urine, stool cultures pending
   - Surgery following; appreciate
   * Tachycardia: Sinus tachycardia to the 140s. Unclear etiology
   patient now febrile; also concerning for sepsis, hypovolemia, and
   alcohol withdrawal.
   - Tylenol
   - IVF hydration
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Consider benzodiazepine for alcohol withdrawal
   * Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Intubated initially in the setting of
   a code.
   - Continue supportive ventilation with goal to compensate for her
   profound metabolic acidosis from a ventilatory standpoint
   * Acute renal failure: Initially appears pre-renal in the setting of
   poor PO and FeNa 0.4. The patient may progress to ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.
   - IVF hydration
   - Continue to monitor
   * Anemia: The patient
s baseline hematocrit is 32 and was 25 on
   admission. Hematocrit has now dropped to 21, likely in the setting of
   dilution.  Hemolysis labs negative. Guaiac negative on admission.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Active type and cross
 will transfused 1 unit PRBC now
   - Continue to monitor
   * EtoH abuse: Concern for alcohol withdrawal as above.
   - Thiamine 100 mg IV x 3 days, folate, MVI
   - Consider benzodiazepine for alcohol withdrawal
   * Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia. Improved with fluids.
   - Recheck laboratories
   * Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. The patient had recently been
   drinking significant amounts of alcohol, which was likely responsible.
   - Q2H FSG for now
   * Polysubstance abuse: History ofalcohol abuse as above. Urine positive
   for cocaine.
   - Monitor

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source .
   >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions.  She seems
   to be slightly improved from yesterday. Will cont cooling and follow
   serial exams and remove sedation post cooling protocol
    - serial exams
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, consider EEG
   - Cooling protocol.
   > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code.
   Although her intial oxygenation was OK and she conts to improve (her
   chest CT is largely unremarkable)
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis, now appears
   as if she is doing better, wil try to switch to PS today.
   > Anemia: likely dilutional in nature and acute on chronic. Will
   transfuse to keep Hct > 21 received 1 U 6/1with appropriate.
   >Hypotension/Tachycardia: no obvious source at first glance although
   concerns include: abdominal souce (normal LFT, panreatic zymes but
   elevated lactate and distended colon air gas pattern with no obvious
   transition site ) in the setting of her hx of abdominal sources (hx of
   abdominal surgery)
   - Cont to support with IVF
   - Check KUB today
   - cont Abx (Vanco, Cirpo, flagyl)
   - cont to trend the lactate
   - f/u with surgery
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. She also appears
   to have a mildly elevated osmolar gap. There is no hx of  unusual
   ingestion, buyt we do not have a very good history in general for this
   patient so it seems prudent to keep a broad differential(her methanol
   was negative and ethylene glycol is pending). It is also possible she
   had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   -   Cont to gently hydrate
   - Follow lactate
   - Appreciate toxicology input
   - Discuss case with toxicology service
   - Thiamine repletion
   - Change fluid resus to LR (the HCO3 is a titrateable acid load)
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above. If
   she progresses into ATN may need dialysis support.
   > Access: will need to change femoral CVC to PICC or triple lumen IJ

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain, had an asystolic arrest in the ED, and was asystolic for approximately 40 minutes. Pre-arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate, profound high anion gap (AG) acidosis, and complaints of abdominal pain. She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her exam this morning. There is no clear source of her decompensation at this point, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications, including altered mental status, hypoxic respiratory failure, anemia, hypotension/tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and possible thiamine deficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions with septal thickening compatible with volume overload.
2. Endotracheal tube is in adequate position, but the NG tube should be substantially advanced for optimal positioning.
3. Limited evaluation of the abdominal organs due to post-surgical changes, no evidence for acute intra-abdominal process.
4. Trace free fluid, cecal and ascending colonic wall thickening, and pericholecystic fluid most likely secondary to fluid resuscitation and third spacing.
5. Right adrenal adenoma.
6. Venous and arterial right femoral lines in adequate position.

   ingestion, but we do not have a very good history in general for this
   patient so it seems prudent to keep a broad differential(her methanol
   was negative and ethylene glycol is pending). It is also possible she
   had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. Today, her AG has largely resolved.

","The patient is a 54-year-old female who presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain. She experienced an aystolic arrest in the emergency department and was aystolic for approximately 40 minutes. Prior to the arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate levels, profound high anion gap acidosis, and complaints of abdominal pain. She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her examination this morning. The source of her decompensation is unclear at this point, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, likely due to hypoxic brain injury in the setting of asystolic arrest and recent ingestions. She shows slight improvement from yesterday. Cooling protocol will be continued, and serial exams will be followed, with the removal of sedation post cooling protocol. Hypoxic respiratory failure is present, as she was intubated initially during a code. She continues to improve, and supportive ventilation will be maintained to compensate for her profound metabolic acidosis. An attempt to switch to pressure support ventilation (PSV) today will be made.

The patient also has anemia, which is likely dilutional in nature and acute on chronic. A blood transfusion will be given to keep hematocrit (Hct) above 21%. Hypotension and tachycardia are present, with no obvious source at first glance. Concerns include an abdominal source, as evidenced by normal liver function tests ("

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Small bilateral pleural effusions with septal thickening compatible
   with
   volume overload. There is no consolidation or lung mass.
   2. Endotracheal tube is in adequate position. NG tube terminates in the
   mid
   thoracic portion of the dilated esophagus, and should be substantially
   advanced for optimal positioning.
   3. Limited evaluation of the abdominal organs in the lack of
   intravenous or
   oral contrast. There are extensive post-surgical changes, no evidence
   for
   acute intra-abdominal process, including no free air or abscess
   formation.
   4. Trace free fluid, cecal and ascending colonic wall thickening, and
   pericholecystic fluid most likely secondary to fluid resuscitation and
   third
   spacing. Additionally, the wall thickening in the ascending colon may
   reflect
   an element of portal hypertension.
   5. Right adrenal adenoma.
   6. Venous and arterial right femoral lines in adequate position.
   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source .
    >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions.  She seems
   to be slightly improved from yesterday. Will cont cooling and follow
   serial exams and remove sedation post cooling protocol.
    - serial exams
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, consider EEG
   - Cooling protocol.
   > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code. She
    conts to improve (her chest CT is largely unremarkable)
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis, now appears
   as if she is doing better, will try to switch to PS today.
   > Anemia: likely dilutional in nature and acute on chronic. Will
   transfuse to keep Hct > 21 received 1 U 6/1with appropriate.
   >Hypotension/Tachycardia: no obvious source at first glance although
   concerns include: abdominal souce (normal LFT, panreatic zymes but
   elevated lactate and distended colon air gas pattern with no obvious
   transition site ) in the setting of her hx of abdominal sources (hx of
   abdominal surgery). This AM appears under better control
   - Cont to support with IVF
   - Check KUB today
   - cont Abx (Vanco, Cirpo, flagyl)
   - cont to trend the lactate
   - f/u with surgery
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. She also appears
   to have a mildly elevated osmolar gap. There is no hx of  unusual
   ingestion, but we do not have a very good history in general for this
   patient so it seems prudent to keep a broad differential(her methanol
   was negative and ethylene glycol is pending). It is also possible she
   had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. Today, her AG has largely resolved.
   -   Cont to gently hydrate
   - Follow lactate
   - Appreciate toxicology input
   - Thiamine repletion
   - Change fluid resus to LR (the HCO3 is a titrateable acid load)
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above. If
   she progresses into ATN may need dialysis support.   Her Cr seems to
   have stabilized.
   > Access: will need to change femoral CVC to PICC or triple lumen IJ

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain. She experienced a cardiac arrest in the emergency department and was without pulse for approximately 40 minutes. Pre-arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate, profound high anion gap (AG) acidosis, and complaints of abdominal pain. She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her exam this morning. The cause of her decompensation is unclear at this point, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, hypoxic respiratory failure, anemia, hypotension/tachycardia, and metabolic acidosis. She has diffuse cerebral edema, no obvious source of hypotension/tachycardia, and high AG acidosis. Her renal function is impaired, and she may require dialysis support. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 102.2°F (39°C)
- Heart rate: 103 bpm (with a range of 101-140 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 113/69 mmHg (with a range of 85-116/38-87 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (with a range of 13-32 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on endotracheal tube ventilation

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a
   >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions.  At this
   point it seems reasonable to initiate a cooling protocol.  Her lack of
   brain stem relfexes and what appears to be de-cerebrate posturing in
   the context of prolonged down time does not bode well for her
   neurologic receovery. Other addiional factors would be a possible
   meningitis although her history does not seem consistent with this and
   I would be hesitant to perform LP in the absence of repeat CT scanning.
   - serial exams
   - Neuro consult, consider EEG
   - Cooling protocol.
   > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code.
   Although her intial oxygenation was OK
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis
   > Anemia: likely dilutional in nature and acute on chronic. Will
   transfuse to keep Hct > 21.
   >Hypotension/Tachycardia: no obvious source at first glance although
   concerns include: abdominal souce (normal LFT, panreatic zymes but
   elevated lactate and distended colon air gas pattern with no obvious
   transition site ) in the setting of her hx of abdominal sources
   - Cont to support with IVF and vasopressors as needed (NE)
   - unable to check true mixed venous sat given only femoral line
   >Leukocytosis: with >20% bandemia in an asplenic host. The only source
   thus far is abdominal (with distended gas pattern and elevated
   lactate.  Current abx reg includes Vanco, Cipro, Flagyl.  Post
   admission she developed fever (rectal) to 39C.   Now with dropping WBC
   (which may also be consistent with sepsis)
   - CT chest, abd and pelvis
   - Broad spectrum Abx
   - F/u with surgery post imaging of abd
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. She also appears
   to have a mildly elevated osmolar gap. There is no hx of  unusual
   ingestion, buyt we do not have a very good history in general for this
   patient so it seems prudent to keep a broad differential.  Her ketosis
   and lactic acidosis coud also be contributing to her osmolar gap to a
   limited degree.  Another possibility is thiamine deficiency with
   exposure to dextrose in the absence of adequate thiamine leading to an
   anaerobic conversion and lactic acidosis, we will replete thiamine now.
   - Follow lactate
   - F/u ethylene gycol and methanol
   - Discuss case with toxicology service
   - Thiamine repletion
   - Change fluid resus to LR (the HCO3 is a titrateable acid load)
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above. If
   she progresses into ATN may need dialysis support.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain, followed by a cardiac arrest in the emergency department. She was resuscitated but remained aystolic for approximately 40 minutes. The patient's notable findings include an elevated lactate level, profound high anion gap (AG) acidosis, altered mental status, and concerns for hypoxic brain injury.

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation to support respiratory failure. She is also receiving vasopressors for hypotension and has been transfused to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) above 21 due to anemia.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with bands, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. There is also a mildly elevated osmolar gap, which could indicate an unusual ingestion or thiamine deficiency.

The assessment and plan include initiating a cooling protocol due to the patient's lack of brainstem reflexes and decerebrate posturing, suggesting potential hypoxic brain injury. Neurological consult and EEG have been ordered, along with serial exams.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and potential complications may include sepsis, meningitis, further deterioration in renal function, worsening of respiratory failure, and the need for dialysis support.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction and requires aggressive management in the ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and previous splenectomy. She presented initially with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by a 26-minute asystolic arrest in the emergency department. The patient has multiple laboratory abnormalities including significant bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate.

The patient's current condition includes sepsis with an unclear etiology. She is being treated with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. Diarrhea has not been observed yet, but studies for Clostridium difficile are being sent. Empirically, oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole have been started. Repeat blood cultures, chest X-ray, and sputum culture have been ordered.

The patient also has status post arrest, with the most likely etiologies being acidosis or potential toxin ingestion. A cooling protocol has been completed, and an additional day of EEG is planned to follow up on neurologic recommendations.

The patient continues to have anion gap metabolic acidosis, although lactic acidosis is now decreasing. Bicarbonate is being given as needed, and ethylene glycol testing is negative. Dextrose in lactated Ringer's solution at 100 cc/hr is being administered.

The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure is being managed with pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 5/5 and FiO2"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis. The patient's medical history includes allergies to iodine and shellfish, as well as a recent surgery. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and has had an orogastric tube advanced into the stomach. Central lines have been placed, and the patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressures set at PSV 5/5. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. The patient's labs reveal anemia, elevated lactate levels, renal failure, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's neurological assessment is not available. The patient is diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, anemia, hypoxemia, and altered mental status. The patient is receiving ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic treatments for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ Dysfunction: The patient is currently diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. However, due to the presence of renal failure and altered mental status, there is a risk of additional organ dysfunction developing, such as respiratory, hepatic, or cardiovascular dysfunction.
2. Infection Spread: Sepsis can lead to the spread of infection throughout the body. There is a risk of developing new infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, status post splenectomy, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She initially presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by a 26-minute asystolic arrest. The patient has significant laboratory abnormalities, including bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate. She is currently in the ICU for sepsis with an unclear etiology. The patient has been treated with antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole) for a potential abdominal process. Other ongoing assessments and plans include status post arrest, anion gap metabolic acidosis, tachycardia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia, ethanol abuse, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and polysubstance abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis, such as organ dysfunction or failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress to severe respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation support.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, which can lead to AKI. This may result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, uremia, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, she is at risk for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can manifest as tremors, agitation, seizures, and delirium tremens.
5. Thiamine Deficiency: Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to thiamine deficiency, resulting in neurological complications like Wernicke's encephalopathy or beriberi.
6. Infection: The patient is immunocompromised due to splenectomy, making her susceptible to infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections.
7. Organ Dysfunction: Sepsis and other underlying conditions can lead to organ dysfunction, such as hepatic failure, cardiovascular collapse, or gastrointestinal complications.

These are potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and previous splenectomy. She initially presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by a 26-minute asystolic arrest. The patient has multiple laboratory abnormalities including significant bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is immunocompromised due to splenectomy, and there is concern for a catastrophic abdominal event given gas distended bowel loops and recent complaints of abdominal pain. The initial chest x-ray and urinalysis did not show any signs of infection, but further investigations are needed to rule out sepsis.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline hematocrit has dropped from 32 to 21, likely due to dilution. This may indicate pre-renal azotemia. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and IV fluid hydration with D5LR x 1 L today should be continued to maintain adequate renal perfusion.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis with significant lactic acidosis, ketones, and a high osmolar gap. This could be due to dehydration, renal failure, or profound thiamine deficiency. Further evaluation for underlying causes is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source
   with her WBC continuning to increase
   >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions, she has
   brain stem function, but  now decerebrating. Overall poor prognosis.
    - serial exams
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, EEG
    > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code.
   She  conts to improve (her chest CT is largely unremarkable)
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis,
   - Tolerating PS well at this point
   > Anemia: likely dilutional in nature and acute on chronic. Will
   transfuse to keep Hct > 21 received 1 U 6/1with appropriate.
   >Hypotension/Tachycardia: no obvious source at first glance although
   concerns include: abdominal souce (normal LFT, panreatic zymes but
   elevated lactate and distended colon air gas pattern with no obvious
   transition site ) in the setting of her hx of abdominal sources (hx of
   abdominal surgery).  These issues have improved substantially over the
   last 24 hrs. Contiune to worry that the abdomen is a source given the
   thickened cecum although there are limited options for management.
   Seems reasonable to trial covering c. dif.
   - Cont to support with IVF
   - Add PO Vanco to empiric c. dif
   - cont Abx (Vanco, Cirpo, flagyl)
   - cont to trend the lactate
   - f/u with surgery
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. No evidence of
   toxic ingestion (meth and ethylene glycol neg) . It is also possible
   she had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. Today, her AG has improved but it is still about
   15
   - Cont to gently hydrate with LR
   - Follow lactate
   - Thiamine repletion
   - Change fluid resus to LR (the HCO3 is a titrateable acid load)
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above, she
   seems to have stabilized her renal function at this point.
   > Access: try to get radial arterial line (and remove femoral art
   line).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with hypoglycemia, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath. She experienced an aystolic arrest in the emergency department and was aystolic for approximately 40 minutes. Pre-arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate levels, profound high anion gap acidosis, and abdominal pain. She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her exam this morning. There is no clear source for her decompensation at this point, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source with her white blood cell count continuing to increase.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status: Significant concern for hypoxic brain injury in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions. She has brainstem function but is now decerebrating. Overall poor prognosis.
- Serial exams
- Appreciate Neuro consult, EEG

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Initially intubated in the setting of a code. She continues to improve (her chest CT is largely unremarkable).
- Continue supportive ventilation with the goal to compensate from a ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis.
- Tolerating pressure support well at this point.

3. Anemia: Likely dilutional in nature and acute on chronic. Will transfuse to keep hematocrit (Hct) > 21 received 1 unit yesterday.

There is no clear source for her decompensation, but the abdomen appears to be the most likely source. The patient's white blood cell count continues to increase.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic brain injury: The patient's altered mental status and decerebrating posture suggest a significant concern for hypoxic brain injury due to the asystolic arrest and recent ingestions.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on ventilatory support to compensate for her profound metabolic acidosis. Continuous monitoring and support are required.
3. Anemia: The patient is likely experiencing dilutional anemia, which is acute on chronic. Transfusion is planned to keep hematocrit (Hct) above 21%.
4. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be due to an abdominal source, possibly c. difficile infection. Antibiotic coverage for c. difficile has been added to the patient's treatment plan.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source .
   >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions.  She seems
   to be slightly improved from yesterday. Will cont cooling and follow
   serial exams and remove sedation post cooling protocol.
    - serial exams
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, consider EEG
   - Cooling protocol.
    > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code.
   She  conts to improve (her chest CT is largely unremarkable)
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis, now appears
   as if she is doing better, will try to switch to PS today.
   > Anemia: likely dilutional in nature and acute on chronic. Will
   transfuse to keep Hct > 21 received 1 U 6/1with appropriate.
   >Hypotension/Tachycardia: no obvious source at first glance although
   concerns include: abdominal souce (normal LFT, panreatic zymes but
   elevated lactate and distended colon air gas pattern with no obvious
   transition site ) in the setting of her hx of abdominal sources (hx of
   abdominal surgery). This AM appears under better control
   - Cont to support with IVF
   - Check KUB today
   - cont Abx (Vanco, Cirpo, flagyl)
   - cont to trend the lactate
   - f/u with surgery
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. She also appears
   to have a mildly elevated osmolar gap. There is no hx of  unusual
   ingestion, but we do not have a very good history in general for this
   patient so it seems prudent to keep a broad differential(her methanol
   was negative and ethylene glycol is pending). It is also possible she
   had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. Today, her AG has largely resolved.
   -   Cont to gently hydrate
   - Follow lactate
   - Appreciate toxicology input
   - Thiamine repletion
   - Change fluid resus to LR (the HCO3 is a titrateable acid load)
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above. If
   she progresses into ATN may need dialysis support.   Her Cr seems to
   have stabilized.
   > Access: will need to change femoral CVC to PICC or triple lumen IJ

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain, and experienced an aystolic arrest in the emergency department. She was resuscitated but remained aystolic for approximately 40 minutes. Her most notable findings before the arrest were elevated lactate, profound high anion gap (AG) acidosis, and abdominal pain. She has diffuse cerebral edema and limited improvement in her exam. The source of her decompensation is unclear, but the abdomen appears to be the most likely source. She has altered mental status, hypoxic respiratory failure, anemia, hypotension/tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Brain Injury: The patient's altered mental status is a significant concern for hypoxic brain injury due to the asystolic arrest and recent ingestions. Continuous cooling and monitoring of serial exams are recommended.
2. Ventilatory Failure: The patient initially required intubation in the setting of a code. Continuous supportive ventilation is necessary to compensate for her profound metabolic acidosis.
3. Anemia: The patient likely has dilutional anemia, which is acute on chronic. Blood transfusion is required to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) greater than 21.
4. Hypotension/Tachycardia: There is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and previous splenectomy. She presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by a 26-minute asystolic arrest in the emergency department. The patient has multiple laboratory abnormalities including significant bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation on pressure support mode. Her vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 bpm and mildly elevated blood pressure of 138/81 mmHg. She is febrile with a temperature of 37.9 C (100.2 F). The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 99% with the use of supplemental oxygen. She is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to concerns about an acute intra-abdominal process. She has received blood transfusions and is being treated empirically with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for possible sepsis of unclear etiology. Additional tests and consultations have been ordered to further evaluate her condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's rising white blood cell count, fever, and laboratory abnormalities suggest ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not effectively managed.
2. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an ongoing lactic acidosis, although the lactate levels are decreasing."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions. The chief complaint is not specified in the note. 

The patient underwent surgery, but there is no evidence of an acute intra-abdominal process. The neurology department's preliminary read of the EEG shows minimal cortical activity. The patient received a blood transfusion of 1 unit PRBC and was started on empiric PO Vancomycin. However, D-Lactate could not be added, and it is planned to contact a clinical pathology resident for further assistance.

The patient has allergies to iodine, shellfish, and unknown allergens. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Levofloxacin on 04/15 at 08:51 AM, Vancomycin on 04/16 at 07:42 AM, Ciprofloxacin on 04/17 at 08:00 PM, and Metronidazole on 04/18 at 02:00 AM.

The patient is receiving various medications including Pantoprazole (Protonix) on 04/17 at 09:28 AM and Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis) on 04/17 at 06:06 PM.

The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged except for the noted review of systems. The review of systems is also unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The vital signs and flow sheet data indicate that the patient's temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate is 117 bpm with a range of 109-118 bpm, blood pressure is 138/81 mmHg with a range of 97/52-138/82 mmHg, respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute with a range of 16-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The fluid balance shows a total input of 4,168 mL with 680 mL given through the PO route, and a total output of 1,640 mL with 500 mL through the urine. The patient received a total of 3,553 mL of IV fluids and 375 mL of blood products. The NG output was 400 mL.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 395 mL (311-651 mL), peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 74. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH: 7.23, PaCO2: 50.8 mmHg, PaO2: 103 mmHg, and HCO3-: 23 mEq"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, status post splenectomy, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She initially presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by a 26-minute asystolic arrest and multiple laboratory abnormalities. The patient is currently in the ICU with ongoing health issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has unclear etiology sepsis, as indicated by rising white blood cell count and bandemia. Low-grade fevers are also present. The patient continues to be treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. Blood cultures and sputum cultures are being followed up.

2. Brain Dysfunction: After the arrest, the patient demonstrates brainstem function only with pupillary reflexes and corneal reflexes. An EEG read is pending, and neurology recommendations are being sought.

3. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is trending down. Lactate levels are being repeated, and thiamine levels are being monitored due to concerns about alcohol withdrawal.

4. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with FiO2 set at 40%. She is doing well with these settings, and they will continue to monitor her neurologic status to determine if extubation is possible.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source
   with her WBC continuning to increase
    >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions, she has
   brain stem function, but  now decerebrating. Overall poor prognosis.
    - serial exams
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, EEG
 is suggestive of
near
 vegetative
   state-very ominous and portends extremely poor chance of  recovery of
   any significant CNS function.
    > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code.
   She  conts to improve (her chest CT is largely unremarkable)
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis,
   - Tolerating PS well at this point
   > Anemia: likely dilutional in nature and acute on chronic. Will
   transfuse to keep Hct > 21 received 1 U 6/1with appropriate.
   >Hypotension/Tachycardia: no obvious source at first glance although
   concerns include: abdominal souce (normal LFT, panreatic zymes but
   elevated lactate and distended colon air gas pattern with no obvious
   transition site ) in the setting of her hx of abdominal sources (hx of
   abdominal surgery).  These issues have improved substantially over the
   last 24 hrs. Contiune to worry that the abdomen is a source given the
   thickened cecum although there are limited options for management.
   Seems reasonable to trial covering c. dif.
   - Cont to support with IVF
   - Add PO Vanco to empiric c. dif
   - cont Abx (Vanco, Cirpo, flagyl)
   - cont to trend the lactate
   - f/u with surgery
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. No evidence of
   toxic ingestion (meth and ethylene glycol neg) . It is also possible
   she had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. Today, her AG has improved but it is still about
   15
   - Cont to gently hydrate with LR
   - Follow lactate
   - Thiamine repletion
   - Change fluid resus to LR (the HCO3 is a titrateable acid load)
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above, she
   seems to have stabilized her renal function at this point.
   > Access: try to get radial arterial line (and remove femoral art
   line).

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain. She experienced an asystolic arrest in the emergency department and was asystolic for approximately 40 minutes. Prior to the arrest, her notable findings included an elevated lactate level, profound high anion gap (AG) acidosis, and complaint of abdominal pain.

The patient has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her exam this morning. The cause of her decompensation is not clear at this point, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source with her white blood cell count continuing to increase.

The patient's altered mental status is a significant concern for hypoxic brain injury in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions. She has brainstem function but is now decerebrating. Her overall prognosis is poor.

The patient's respiratory failure required intubation initially during a code. She continues to improve, and her chest CT is largely unremarkable. Supportive ventilation will be continued with the goal of compensating for her profound metabolic acidosis.

The patient has anemia, which is likely dilutional in nature and acute on chronic. She will be transfused to keep her hematocrit (Hct) above 21% and has already received one unit. There are no obvious sources of hypotension and tachycardia, although concerns include an abdominal"

   would be difficult to exclude.
   3. Small non-occlusive filling defect in the right external iliac vein
   with a
   linear orientation, which likely represents a recannulized chronic
   thrombus.
   4. Diffuse body wall anasarca, small bilateral pleural effusion, and

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source
   with her WBC continuning to increase
    >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions, she has
   brain stem function, but  now decerebrating. Overall poor prognosis.
    - serial exams
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, EEG
 is suggestive of
near
 vegetative
   state-very ominous and portends extremely poor chance of  recovery of
   any significant CNS function.
    > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code. She
   is currently stable (her chest CT is largely unremarkable)
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis,
   - Tolerating PS well at this point
   > Anemia: likely dilutional in nature and acute on chronic. Will
   transfuse to keep Hct > 21 received 1 U 6/1with appropriate.
   >Hypotension/Tachycardia: no obvious source at first glance although
   concerns include: abdominal souce (normal LFT, panreatic zymes but
   elevated lactate and distended colon air gas pattern with no obvious
   transition site ) in the setting of her hx of abdominal sources (hx of
   abdominal surgery).  These issues have improved substantially over the
   last 24 hrs. Contiune to worry that the abdomen is a source given the
   thickened cecum although there are limited options for management.
   Seems reasonable to trial covering c. dif.   Her CXR this AM shows cont
   dilation of the bowel.
   - Cont to support with IVF
   - Add PO Vanco to empiric c. dif
   - cont Abx (Vanco, Cirpo, flagyl)
   - cont to trend the lactate
   - appreciate surgery input
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. No evidence of
   toxic ingestion (meth and ethylene glycol neg) . It is also possible
   she had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. This issue is now stable.
   - Cont to gently hydrate with LR
   - Follow lactate
   - Thiamine repletion
   - Change fluid resus to LR (the HCO3 is a titrateable acid load)
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above, she
   seems to have stabilized her renal function at this point.
   > Access: try to get radial arterial line (and remove femoral art
   line).

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain. She experienced an aystolic arrest in the emergency department and was aystolic for approximately 40 minutes. Pre-arrest, her notable findings included an elevated lactate, profound high anion gap (AG) acidosis, and complaint of abdominal pain. The patient has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her exam this morning. There is no clear source for her decompensation at this point, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source, considering her increasing white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a significant concern for hypoxic brain injury in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions. She has brainstem function but is now decerebrating. Overall, poor prognosis is expected.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated due to a code. She is currently stable, and her chest CT is largely unremarkable. Supportive ventilation will continue to compensate for her profound metabolic acidosis.
3. Anemia: The patient likely has dilutional anemia that is acute on chronic. She will be transfused to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) above 21 and has already received one unit.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and previous splenectomy. She was admitted with altered mental status, dyspnea, and had an asystolic arrest lasting 26 minutes. She has been experiencing multiple lab abnormalities including bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate. Her current condition includes sepsis of unclear etiology, status post arrest/neurologic status, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia, and ethanol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is of unclear etiology, but her improving white blood cell count and resolution of bandemia suggest that the infection is being managed. However, continuous monitoring of cultures and antibiotic therapy will be necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Neurologic Status: The patient's neurologic status post arrest is concerning. There is no evidence of cortical function without sedation, and further neurologic exams, EEG monitoring, and potential paralysis if baseline artifact persists may be required. Continuous communication with the family about the poor prognosis is also important.

3. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis has resolved, and her lactate levels are normal. However, follow-up on thiamine levels should be done, and she should continue to be monitored for signs of ETOH withdrawal.

4. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, status post splenectomy, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by an asystolic arrest for 26 minutes. The patient has multiple laboratory abnormalities, including significant bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate. She is currently experiencing low-grade fevers and shows signs of sepsis. The etiology of the infection is unclear, but there is ascending colon wall thickening seen on CT scan. Blood cultures and sputum cultures are being followed up.

The patient's neurological status remains poor, with no cortical function observed and only brainstem reflexes present. An EEG has been ordered to confirm the absence of brain activity. The family has been informed about the grim prognosis.

The patient also has anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is trending down, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with supplemental oxygen. Acute renal failure is present, with stable creatinine levels around 1.4. Anemia is relatively stable, and the patient has a history of alcohol abuse, with concerns for alcohol withdrawal. Thiamine supplementation has been initiated.

The patient's urine is positive for cocaine, indicating polysubstance abuse. She is being closely monitored in the ICU, and various interventions are being implemented to manage her conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source
   with her WBC elevated.
   >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions, she has
   brain stem function, but  now decerebrating. Overall poor prognosis.
    - serial exams
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, EEG
 is suggestive of
near
 vegetative
   state-very ominous and portends extremely poor chance of  recovery of
   any significant CNS function (although poor quality study). Will plan
   on repeat EEG today (which will likely require paralysis)
   - defer LP for now.
    > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code. She
   is currently stable (her chest CT is largely unremarkable)
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis,
   - Tolerating PS well at this point, repeat ABG
   - advance ETT tube
   - will need to change to vol control vent when paralyzed
   >Hypotension/Tachycardia: no obvious source at first glance although
   concerns include: abdominal souce (normal LFT, panreatic zymes but
   elevated lactate and distended colon air gas pattern with no obvious
   transition site ) in the setting of her hx of abdominal sources (hx of
   abdominal surgery).  These issues have improved substantially over the
   last 24 hrs. Contiune to worry that the abdomen is a source given the
   thickened cecum although there are limited options for management.
   Seems reasonable to trial covering c. dif.   Her CXR this AM shows cont
   dilation of the bowel.
   - Cont to support with IVF
   -  PO Vanco empiric for  c. dif
   - cont Abx (Vanco, Cipro, flagyl)
   - cont to trend the lactate
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. No evidence of
   toxic ingestion (meth and ethylene glycol neg) . It is also possible
   she had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. This issue is now stable.
   - Cont to gently hydrate with LR
   - Follow lactate
   - Thiamine repletion
   - Change fluid resus to LR (the HCO3 is a titrateable acid load)
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above, she
   seems to have stabilized her renal function at this point.
   > Access: try to get radial arterial line (and remove femoral art
   line), unsuccessful on [**4-18**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with hypoglycemia and complaints of abdominal pain and shortness of breath. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest in the emergency department and was without a pulse for approximately 40 minutes. Prior to the arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate, profound high anion gap (AG) acidosis, and abdominal pain. She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her examination. 

The patient's current assessment includes several potential medical complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: There is a significant concern for hypoxic brain injury in the setting of asystolic arrest and recent ingestions. The patient has brainstem function but is now decerebrating. Overall, poor prognosis is expected.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated initially due to respiratory failure during the code. She is currently stable, and supportive ventilation is being provided to compensate for her profound metabolic acidosis.
3. Hypotension/Tachycardia: There is no obvious source for these issues, although concerns include an abdominal source, such as sepsis or intra-abdominal bleeding. The patient's history of abdominal surgeries increases the likelihood of an abdominal source.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has high AG acidosis, likely due to lactate, ketones, and an unmeasured acid load in the setting"

   CXR [**4-19**]: ETT high, bilateral consolidation at the bases
   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source
   with her WBC elevated.
   >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions, she has
   brain stem function, but  now decerebrating. Overall poor prognosis.
    - serial exams
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, EEG
 is suggestive of
near
 vegetative
   state-very ominous and portends extremely poor chance of  recovery of
   any significant CNS function (although poor quality study). Will plan
   on repeat EEG today (which will likely require paralysis)
   - defer LP for now.
    > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code. She
   is currently stable (her chest CT is largely unremarkable)
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis,
   - Tolerating PS well at this point, repeat ABG
   - advance ETT tube
   - will need to change to vol control vent when paralyzed
   >Hypotension/Tachycardia: no obvious source at first glance although
   concerns include: abdominal souce (normal LFT, panreatic zymes but
   elevated lactate and distended colon air gas pattern with no obvious
   transition site ) in the setting of her hx of abdominal sources (hx of
   abdominal surgery).  These issues have improved substantially over the
   last 24 hrs. Contiune to worry that the abdomen is a source given the
   thickened cecum although there are limited options for management.
   Seems reasonable to trial covering c. dif.   Her CXR this AM shows cont
   dilation of the bowel.
   - Cont to support with IVF
   -  PO Vanco empiric for  c. dif
   - cont Abx (Vanco, Cipro, flagyl)
   - cont to trend the lactate
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. No evidence of
   toxic ingestion (meth and ethylene glycol neg) . It is also possible
   she had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. This issue is now stable.
   - Cont to gently hydrate with LR
   - Follow lactate
   - Thiamine repletion
   - Change fluid resus to LR (the HCO3 is a titrateable acid load)
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above, she
   seems to have stabilized her renal function at this point.
   > Access: try to get radial arterial line (and remove femoral art
   line), unsuccessful on [**4-18**]

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain, followed by an asystolic arrest in the emergency department. She remained asystolic for approximately 40 minutes before being resuscitated. Pre-arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate, profound high anion gap (AG) acidosis, and complaints of abdominal pain.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is described as having diffuse cerebral edema with limited improvement in her examination this morning. There is no clear source for her decompensation at this time, but the abdomen appears to be the most likely source, given the elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, which is concerning for hypoxic brain injury in the setting of asystolic arrest and recent ingestions.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, as she is intubated initially during a code and currently tolerating pressure support (PS) well. She will continue to be supported with controlled ventilation to compensate for her profound metabolic acidosis. A repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) will be obtained, and the endotracheal tube (ETT) will be advanced when paralyzed.

The patient's hypotension and tachycardia have improved over the past 24 hours, but there is still concern for an abdominal source, especially considering her history of abdominal surgeries."

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and previous splenectomy. She presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by a 26-minute asystolic arrest. The patient has multiple laboratory abnormalities, including bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 40% and shows improvement in her condition. The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis has resolved, and her renal function has improved. She also has anemia but her hematocrit levels are relatively stable. The patient's hypertension and tachycardia are being managed with labetalol IV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with laboratory abnormalities indicative of sepsis, including bandemia and metabolic acidosis. Although the bandemia has resolved, the source of infection is still unclear. Therefore, it is important to continue monitoring for signs of sepsis and treat empirically until the source is identified.
2. Neurologic Status: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, and there is concern about potential cortical dysfunction. Further evaluation of the patient's neurologic status is necessary, including a final EEG read while the patient is paralyzed. This will help determine if the patient has cerebral hypoxic-myoxic encephalopathy (CMO).
3. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially had anion gap metabolic acidosis, but it"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, who underwent a splenectomy and multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with altered mental status, dyspnea, and subsequent asystolic arrest lasting 26 minutes. She has multiple laboratory abnormalities including bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PSV mode, FiO2 40%, and doing well. Her condition is complicated by sepsis with unclear etiology, status post arrest/neurologic status, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia, ethanol abuse, hypertension/tachycardia, and hypothermia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's bandemia and metabolic acidosis suggest a possible infection. The source of infection is unclear at this point. Monitoring cultures and administering appropriate antibiotics are essential to prevent further complications.

2. Neurologic Impairment: The patient's neurologic status is a concern as she shows no evidence of cortical function off sedation. A final EEG read while paralyzed will help determine the interpretation of EEG and implications for the patient's future neurologic state.

3. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Although the patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis has resolved, it is crucial to monitor her condition for any signs of recurrence. Maintaining appropriate fluid management and electrolyte balance can help prevent further"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, status post splenectomy, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by a 26-minute asystolic arrest and multiple laboratory abnormalities, including significant bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis of unclear etiology. Although her white blood cell count is improving, and bandemia has resolved, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and source control.
2. Neurologic Status: The patient had an asystolic arrest and subsequent neurologic compromise. Further evaluation of her neurologic status is needed, including discussion of the possibility of cerebral multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (CMO) after final EEG results are obtained.
3. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient previously had anion gap metabolic acidosis, but it has since resolved with normalization of lactate levels. However, thiamine levels should still be followed to assess for potential deficiencies.
4. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with FiO2 40% and is doing well. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has improved, but continued follow-up of creatinine levels is essential to monitor"

   not requested to establish brain death, and so cannot be interpreted in
   that manner.
   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source
   with her WBC elevated.
   >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury

   brain stem function, but  now decerebrating. Overall poor prognosis,

   negative thus far, currently on Vanco, (PO, IV), Cipro, flagyl, with
   all clx (although do not have c. dif). Given overall poor prognosis not
   unreasonable to hold, but would favor stopping PO vanco today.
   > HTN/tachycardia: unclear if cerebral dysregulation, withdrawl?
   Responding well to labetalol.
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. No evidence of
   toxic ingestion (meth and ethylene glycol neg) . It is also possible
   she had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. This issue is now stable.
   - Cont to gently hydrate with LR

   seems to have stabilized her renal function at this point.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain, followed by an asystolic arrest in the emergency department. She was resuscitated but remains in critical condition. She has diffuse cerebral edema, altered mental status, and an extremely abnormal EEG suggestive of severe encephalopathy. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her condition is unstable, with multiple organ dysfunctions including leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and hypertension/tachycardia. The patient's prognosis is extremely poor, with limited chances of recovery of any significant CNS function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Brain Injury: The patient's prolonged asystolic arrest and recent ingestions may have caused hypoxic brain injury, leading to altered mental status and decerebration.
2. Ventilatory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and support are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a high anion gap metabolic acidosis due to a mixture of lactate, ketones, and unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. Close monitoring and correction of acid-base balance are essential.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely to worsen post-asystolic event. Aggressive fluid management and hem"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain. She experienced a cardiac arrest in the emergency department and was pulseless for approximately 40 minutes. Prior to the arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate, profound high anion gap acidosis, and abdominal pain. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has diffuse cerebral edema and limited improvement in her examination. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated potassium, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine indicating renal failure. Other lab values indicate abnormalities in liver function tests, electrolytes, and metabolic parameters.

The patient's condition is described as extremely poor, with concerns for hypoxic brain injury due to the prolonged period of asystole and recent ingestions. The EEG is extremely abnormal, showing low voltage and suppressed background consistent with severe encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiology. The patient's prognosis is described as very ominous, with a near vegetative state predicted, indicating a very poor chance of recovery of any significant central nervous system function.

The patient's current plan includes supportive care, including continued ventilation, hydration, and medication adjustments. The patient is also on prophylactic antibiotics, deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source
   with her WBC elevated.
   >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions, she has
   brain stem function, but  now decerebrating. Overall poor prognosis.
   - F/u EEG read from [**4-19**]
   - serial exams
   - Appreciate Neuro consult, EEG
 is suggestive of
near
 vegetative
   state-very ominous and portends extremely poor chance of  recovery of
   any significant CNS function (although poor quality study). Will plan
   on repeat EEG today (which will likely require paralysis)
   - defer LP for now.
     > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code.
   She is currently stable (her chest CT is largely unremarkable)
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis,
   - Tolerating PS well at this point, repeat ABG
   - will need to change to vol control vent when paralyzed
   >Hypotension/Tachycardia: no obvious source at first glance although
   concerns include: abdominal souce (normal LFT, panreatic zymes but
   elevated lactate and distended colon air gas pattern with no obvious
   transition site ) in the setting of her hx of abdominal sources (hx of
   abdominal surgery).  These issues have improved substantially over the
   last 24 hrs. Contiune to worry that the abdomen is a source given the
   thickened cecum although there are limited options for management.
   Seems reasonable to trial covering c. dif.   Her CXR this AM shows cont
   dilation of the bowel.
   - Cont to support with IVF
   -  PO Vanco empiric for  c. dif
   - cont Abx (Vanco, Cipro, flagyl)
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. No evidence of
   toxic ingestion (meth and ethylene glycol neg) . It is also possible
   she had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. This issue is now stable.
   - Cont to gently hydrate with LR
   - Thiamine repletion
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above, she
   seems to have stabilized her renal function at this point.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Hypoxic brain injury: The patient's altered mental status and decerebrating posture indicate a significant concern for hypoxic brain injury due to the asystolic arrest and recent ingestions. This has a poor prognosis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and currently stable with supportive ventilation. There may be a need to change to volume control ventilation when paralyzed for an EEG. The chest CT is largely unremarkable, but ongoing monitoring is required.

3. Hypotension/tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia could be due to an abdominal source, possibly related to previous abdominal surgeries. This requires ongoing support with IV fluids and consideration for covering Clostridium difficile infection.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has high anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to a mixture of lactate, ketones, and unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. Ongoing hydration with lactated Ringer's solution and thiamine repletion are necessary.

5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may worsen following the 40-minute asystolic event. Hemodynamic support is crucial.

6. Infection: The patient is at risk for various infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, and deep vein"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, status post splenectomy, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She initially presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by a 26-minute asystolic arrest and multiple laboratory abnormalities. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications, including sepsis, acute renal failure, anemia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is unclear in etiology. Although her white blood cell count is improving and bandemia has resolved, she still has fevers. The healthcare team should continue to monitor her closely and pursue cultures to identify the source of infection.

2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest with prolonged asystole. This event may have contributed to her current neurological status and potential cortical dysfunction.

3. Neurological status: The patient's EEG demonstrates a grim prognosis for meaningful recovery. Her family has been informed of this possibility, and ongoing discussions regarding the possibility of cerebral multifocal infarcts (CMO) are being held.

4. Oliguria: The patient recently developed oliguria, which is characterized by decreased urine output. This could be due to poor forward flow in the setting of bradycardia and possible myocardial dysfunction after arrest. Monitoring the patient's urine output and creatinine levels is essential.

5. Acute renal failure:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, status post splenectomy, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She initially presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by a 26-minute asystolic arrest and multiple laboratory abnormalities. The patient's prognosis is poor due to an EEG showing grave neurological damage. Her vital signs are currently stable, but there are concerns about impending herniation. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in hypoxemic respiratory failure. She also exhibits signs of sepsis with an unclear etiology, as well as oliguria and acute renal failure. There is evidence of anion gap metabolic acidosis, which has resolved, and the patient has been monitored for ethanol abuse and withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impending herniation: The patient's neurologic status is deteriorating, and there is a concern for impending herniation. This requires immediate attention and possible intervention, such as a head CT scan.
2. Sepsis: The patient is presenting with signs of sepsis, including bandemia and metabolic acidosis. It is important to continue monitoring her vital signs and lab results, and ongoing discussions with the family regarding the possibility of discontinuing life support measures (CMO) should be considered.
3. Oliguria: The patient's urine output has decreased, indicating possible renal dysfunction. Further investigation and monitoring of renal function are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source
   with her WBC elevated.
   >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions, she has
   brain stem function, but  now decerebrating. Overall poor prognosis,
   repeat EEG extremely abnormal with low voltage and worsening exam and
   autonomic dysfunction portends a grim prognosis. Concern now she is
   close to herniating, ? utility of repeat CT scan.
   - serial exams
   - Appreciate Neuro
   - defer LP for now.
   > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code. She
   is currently stable (her chest CT is largely unremarkable)
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis,
   - Tolerating PS well at this point,
    >Leukocytosis: unclear source, thought to be abdomen with all clx
   negative thus far, currently on Vanco, (PO, IV), Cipro, flagyl, with
   all clx (although do not have c. dif). Given overall poor prognosis not
   unreasonable to hold, but would favor stopping PO vanco today.
   > HTN/tachycardia: unclear if cerebral dysregulation vs increasing
   cerebral edema and autonomic dysfunction
   Will d/w neurology, for now trial labetalol and hydralazine.
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. No evidence of
   toxic ingestion (meth and ethylene glycol neg) . It is also possible
   she had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. This issue is now stable.
   - Cont to gently hydrate with LR
   - Thiamine repletion
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above, she
   seems to have stabilized her renal function at this point. Worsening

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain. She experienced an aystolic arrest in the emergency department and remained aystolic for approximately 40 minutes. Prior to the arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate, profound high anion gap acidosis, and complaint of abdominal pain. She also had diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her examination. There is no clear source for her decompensation at this point, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source with an elevated white blood cell count. The patient has altered mental status, which is a significant concern for hypoxic brain injury in the setting of asystolic arrest and recent ingestions. She has brainstem function but is now decerebrating. Overall, her prognosis is poor, and there is concern that she may be close to herniating. The utility of a repeat CT scan is uncertain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic brain injury: The patient's altered mental status and decerebrating state indicate a potential hypoxic brain injury due to the asystolic arrest and recent ingestions.
2. Abdominal source of infection or perforation: The elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible abdominal source of infection or perforation, which could have led to her decompensation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with hypoglycemia and complaints of abdominal pain/shortness of breath. She experienced an aystolic arrest in the ED and remained aystolic for approximately 40 minutes. Pre-arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate, profound high AG acidosis, and abdominal pain. She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her exam this morning. There is no clear source for her decompensation at this point, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source with her elevated WBC count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has significant concern for hypoxic brain injury due to the asystolic arrest and recent ingestions. She exhibits brainstem function but is now decerebrating. Her prognosis is poor, and there is a concern about herniation. Repeating the CT scan may not be useful.

2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated due to respiratory failure during the code. She is currently stable, and her chest CT is largely unremarkable. Supportive ventilation will be continued to compensate for her profound metabolic acidosis.

3. Leukocytosis: The cause of leukocytosis is unclear, but it may be related to the abdomen. The patient is currently on vancomycin (PO/IV), ciprofloxacin, and metron"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with hypoglycemia and complaints of abdominal pain and shortness of breath. The patient had an asystolic arrest in the emergency department and was without pulse for approximately 40 minutes. Pre-arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate, profound high anion gap (AG) acidosis, and complaints of abdominal pain. She now has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her exam this morning. There is no clear source for her decompensation at this point, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source with her elevated white blood cell count (WBC).

The patient has altered mental status, significant concern for hypoxic brain injury in the setting of asystolic arrest and recent ingestions. She has brainstem function but is now decerebrating. Her prognosis is poor, and the repeat electroencephalogram (EEG) is extremely abnormal with low voltage, suggesting near vegetative state with extremely poor chance of recovery of any significant central nervous system (CNS) function.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with hypoglycemia and complaints of abdominal pain and shortness of breath. She experienced an aystolic arrest in the emergency department and was without a pulse for approximately 40 minutes. Prior to the arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate, profound high anion gap acidosis, and complaints of abdominal pain. She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her exam this morning. The cause of her decompensation is unclear, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source with her elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is a significant concern for hypoxic brain injury in the setting of asystolic arrest and recent ingestions. She has brain stem function but is now decerebrating. Overall poor prognosis, repeat EEG extremely abnormal with low voltage and worsening exam and autonomic dysfunction portend a grim prognosis. There is concern that she is close to herniating, and the utility of a repeat CT scan is questioned.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated in the setting of a code. She is currently stable, with a largely unremarkable chest CT. Supportive ventilation will be continued to compensate for her profound metabolic acidosis.
3. Leukocytosis: The cause of the patient's leukocytosis is unclear"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, status post splenectomy, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She initially presented with altered mental status and dyspnea, followed by a prolonged asystolic arrest for 26 minutes. The patient exhibits multiple laboratory abnormalities, including significant bandemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate levels. Her prognosis is poor due to repeat EEG findings.

The patient's current condition includes encephalopathy, likely related to anoxic brain injury from the prolonged PEA arrest. There is no evidence of cortical activity, but signs of intact brainstem function are present. The family has discussed comfort measures only (CMO), and the patient is now CMO. A palliative care consult has been made for family reasons.

The patient is on a morphine IV drip for pain management and a scopolamine patch for nausea. She has a multi-lumen line in place for ICU care. Prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) have been initiated. The patient's code status is CMO, and she is being called out to the floor if a private bed is available."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of bradycardia and hypertension, concerned for imminent herniation. The patient has been experiencing episodes of bradycardia and hypertension, and there is concern for potential herniation. The patient's urine sodium levels indicate prerenal azotemia, and a renal ultrasound showed no signs of hydronephrosis. The patient's temperature is within normal range, and they are receiving morphine sulfate for pain management. The patient has allergies to iodine, shellfish, and unknown allergens. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, labetalol, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted episodes of bradycardia and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient:

1. Imminent herniation: The patient's episodes of bradycardia and hypertension are concerning for potential herniation. This condition requires immediate medical attention as it can lead to brain damage or death if not treated promptly.

2. Prerenal azotemia: The patient's urine sodium levels indicate prerenal azotemia, which means there may be decreased blood flow to the kidneys. This can lead to acute kidney injury if not addressed.

3. Infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo female with hx of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with
   hypoglycemia and a complaint of abdominal pain / shortness of breath
   who had an aystolic arrest in the ED and was aystolic for approximately
   40 minutes. Pre-arrest her most notable findings were an elevated
   lactate, a profound high AG acidosis and a complaint of abdominal
   pain.  She has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her
   exam this AM. There is not a clear source as to her decompensation at
   this point although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source
   with her WBC elevated.
   >Altered Mental status: signifincant concern for hypoxic brain injury
   in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions, she has
   brain stem function, but  now decerebrating. Overall poor prognosis,
   repeat EEG extremely abnormal with low voltage and worsening exam and
   autonomic dysfunction portends a grim prognosis. Concern now she is
   close to herniating, ? utility of repeat CT scan.
   - serial exams
   - Appreciate Neuro
   - defer LP for now.
   > Hypox resp failure: intubated intially in the setting of a code. She
   is currently stable (her chest CT is largely unremarkable)
   - Cont supportive ventilation with goal to compensate from a
   ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis,
   - Tolerating PS well at this point,
    >Leukocytosis: unclear source, thought to be abdomen with all clx
   negative thus far, currently on Vanco, (PO, IV), Cipro, flagyl, with
   all clx (although do not have c. dif). Given overall poor prognosis not
   unreasonable to hold, but would favor stopping PO vanco today.
   > HTN/tachycardia: unclear if cerebral dysregulation vs increasing
   cerebral edema and autonomic dysfunction
   Will d/w neurology, for now trial labetalol and hydralazine.
   > Metabolic acidosis:  high AG a mixture of lactate, ketones and
   unmeasured acid load in the setting of renal failure. No evidence of
   toxic ingestion (meth and ethylene glycol neg) . It is also possible
   she had a low thiamine and had a low blood sugar which she received
   dextrose in ED from may have precipitated an anaerobic state from
   thiamine deificiency. This issue is now stable.
   - Cont to gently hydrate with LR
   - Thiamine repletion
   > Renal failure: acute renal failure which is likely to be worse post
   her 40 min asystolic event. Will support hemodynamically as above, she
   seems to have stabilized her renal function at this point. Worsening

","The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with hypoglycemia and abdominal pain/shortness of breath. She experienced an aystolic arrest in the emergency department and was aystolic for approximately 40 minutes. Pre-arrest, her notable findings included an elevated lactate, a profound high AG acidosis, and complaint of abdominal pain. She now has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her exam this morning. There is no clear source identified for her decompensation at this point, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source with her WBC elevated.

The patient's altered mental status is a significant concern for hypoxic brain injury in the setting of asystolic arrest plus recent ingestions. She has brainstem function but is now decerebrating. Her overall prognosis is poor, and repeat EEG is extremely abnormal with low voltage and worsening exam and autonomic dysfunction, which portends a grim prognosis. There is concern that she may be close to herniating, and it is questioned whether a repeat CT scan would be useful.

The patient is also experiencing hypox respiratory failure, for which she was initially intubated during a code. She is currently stable, and her chest CT is largely unremarkable. Supportive ventilation will be continued with the goal of compensating from a ventilatory standpoint for her profound metabolic acidosis. She is tolerating pressure support well at this point.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries who presented with hypoglycemia and complaints of abdominal pain and shortness of breath. She experienced an aystolic arrest in the emergency department and was asystolic for approximately 40 minutes. Pre-arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate, profound high anion gap acidosis, and complaint of abdominal pain. Currently, she has diffuse cerebral edema but limited improvement in her exam this morning. There is no clear source of her decompensation at this point, although the abdomen appears to be the most likely source with her elevated white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient presented with hypoglycemia, which can lead to various complications such as seizures, altered mental status, and cardiovascular collapse.
2. Diffuse cerebral edema: The patient's cerebral edema may result in increased intracranial pressure, causing symptoms like headache, nausea, vomiting, and neurological deficits.
3. Abdominal pain and elevated WBC count: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated white blood cell count suggest possible abdominal infection or inflammation, which can progress to severe complications like sepsis or organ perforation.
4. Profound high anion gap acidosis: The patient's high anion gap acidosis indicates metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by conditions like lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of multiple abdominal surgeries. She presented with hypoglycemia and complaints of abdominal pain and shortness of breath. The patient experienced an asystolic arrest in the emergency department and remained asystolic for approximately 40 minutes. Prior to the arrest, her notable findings included elevated lactate, profound high anion gap acidosis, and abdominal pain. Currently, the patient has diffuse cerebral edema with limited improvement in her examination. The cause of her decompensation is unclear, but the abdomen appears to be the most likely source, with an elevated white blood cell count indicating a possible infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility of an infection in the abdomen or another part of the body. This could lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support indicates the need for mechanical ventilation. This may be due to respiratory muscle weakness or inadequate gas exchange. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilation settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Organ Dysfunction: The presence of diffuse cerebral edema suggests potential brain injury and impaired neurological function. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's mental status and neurologic exam to detect any further deterioration.

4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's history of an"
