   Assessment and Plan
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   48M with h/o recurrent etoh pancreatitis transferred here for ERCP,
   found to have CBD stricture, now s/p stent, and remains intubated due
   to agitation from ETOH withdrawal.
   .
   # Intubation/Respiratory failure:  Pt remains intubated due to
   agitation from ETOH withdrawal.  Evidence of increased secretion this
   morning, increased bilateral opactities on CXR.  Concern for aspiration
   pneumonitis vs. pneumonia.
   - will consider extubation if secretions improve
   - will start  empiric coverage for HAP and aspiration PNA with vanc,
   cefepime, cipro
   - maintain on propofol to assess mental status periodically
   - daily SBT
   .
   # AMS:  This is likely ETOH withdrawal, timing is consistent.  Pt
   increasingly tachycardic, agitated, and tremuluous on the floor prior
   to ERCP, though no fevers or labile blood pressures.  Can also consider
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Last known drink was [**2119-12-15**].
   - maintain on propofol gtt while intubated to assess mental status
   periodically
   - CIWA with diazepam 10 mg IV Q3H PRN
   - MVI/F/T
   - Social work when extubated
   .
   # Acute ETOH pancreatitis:  Lipase improving with IVFs.  Check
   triglycerides while on propofol.
   - trend LFTs and lipase, improving post-procedure
   .
   # Elevated LFTs:  Pt found to have CBD stricture, now s/p stent.  TB
   should improve in the next couple of days.  If no improvement, consider
   worsening ETOH hepatitis.  Likely also has underlying cirrhosis given
   ETOH history, spider angiomas on exam.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of recurrent alcohol use who was admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure due to a common bile duct stricture and received a stent. However, the patient remains intubated due to agitation from alcohol withdrawal. There are concerns for aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's mental status is being monitored with propofol, and he is receiving treatment for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. His lipase levels are improving with intravenous fluids, but he also has elevated liver enzymes and a history suggestive of underlying cirrhosis. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's agitation and increased secretions put him at risk for aspiration, which could lead to pneumonia.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and immobility, he is at an increased risk for developing HAP.
3. Delirium Tremens: Alcohol withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as delirium tremens, characterized by sudden and severe mental or neurological changes.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and elevated liver enzymes, there is a risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which affects brain function.
5. Pancreatitis Complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with alcohol withdrawal. The patient required invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress and was placed on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 50%. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate between 60-81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/62 mmHg to 114/87 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, and soft non-tender abdomen. No lower extremity edema or muscle wasting is noted. Neurological assessment could not be performed due to sedation.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating possible infection or inflammation. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Liver function tests show elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, which may suggest liver injury or dysfunction. Kidney function appears to be normal based on the provided creatinine levels. Amylase and lipase levels are significantly elevated, indicating acute pancreatitis. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing acute pancreatitis. They are sedated and int"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yom recurrent EtOH pancreatitis, s/p ERCP with CBD stricture --> s/p
   stent, now with peresistent respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persisitent, multifactorial.  Suspect
   predominately pneumonitis, with evolving RLL pneumonia.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Repeat SBT.  Advance ETT.
   RLL INFILTRATE -- evidence for effusion, likely related to
   subdiaphragmatic process and possible pneumonia.  Would iniate
   antimicrobials for aspiration pneumonia.
   AGGITATION -- attributed in part to EtOH withdrawal, medications and
   intubation.  Monitor.  Continue CIWA.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to EtOH withdrawal, intubation, abd
   pain.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- attributed to EtOH, chronic, recurrent.
   ELEVATED LFTs -- now s/p ERCP.  Monitor
   FLUILDS -- replete.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of recurrent EtOH (alcohol) pancreatitis. He underwent an ERCP procedure with CBD stricture and subsequently received a stent. Currently, the patient is experiencing persistent respiratory failure, which is suspected to be primarily due to pneumonitis and evolving right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and repeat a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The patient also has an RLL infiltrate, which is likely related to a subdiaphragmatic process and possible pneumonia. Antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia should be initiated.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing agitation, attributed to EtOH withdrawal, medications, and intubation. His mental status is altered due to EtOH withdrawal, intubation, and abdominal pain. The patient has acute pancreatitis attributed to chronic and recurrent EtOH use. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are observed after the recent ERCP procedure. Fluids are noted to be replete.

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires nutrition support, glycemic control, and monitoring of lines. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with elevation of the head of bed (HOB), mouth care, and daily wake-up calls.

Overall, the patient is critically"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yom recurrent EtOH pancreatitis, s/p ERCP with CBD stricture --> s/p
   stent, now with peresistent respiratory failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persisitent, multifactorial.  Suspect
   predominately pneumonitis, with evolving RLL pneumonia.  Plan continue
   mechanical ventilation.  Repeat SBT.  Advance ETT.
   RLL INFILTRATE -- evidence for effusion, likely related to
   subdiaphragmatic process and possible pneumonia.  Would iniate
   antimicrobials.
   AGGITATION -- attributed in part to EtOH withdrawal, medications and
   intubation.  Monitor.  Continue CIWA.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed to EtOH withdrawal, intubation, abd
   pain.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- attributed to EtOH, chronic, recurrent.
   ELEVATED LFTs -- now s/p ERCP.  Monitor
   FLUILDS -- replete.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of recurrent EtOH pancreatitis who is currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure. The patient underwent an ERCP with CBD stricture and subsequent stent placement. He now presents with evolving right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia and evidence of effusion, likely related to a subdiaphragmatic process and possible pneumonia. The patient also shows signs of agitation, altered mental status, acute pancreatitis, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient's fluid status is replete.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is multifactorial and may be due to pneumonitis and evolving RLL pneumonia. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of RLL infiltrate suggests pneumonia, which can be caused by aspiration, infection from the pancreatitis, or secondary infection due to immobility and intubation. Pneumonia can progress to severe infection, sepsis, and septic shock.
3. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of recurrent EtOH pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis can lead to complications such as necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), potentially causing organ dysfunction.
4. Agitation and Delirium: The patient exhibits agitation, which may be"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of recurrent ethanol (ETOH) pancreatitis who was transferred for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to common bile duct (CBD) stricture. He remains intubated due to agitation from ETOH withdrawal.

1. Intubation/Respiratory failure: The patient has evidence of increased secretions this morning, along with increased bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. There is concern for aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia. The plan is to consider extubation if secretions improve, continue antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin for two days. The chest X-ray will be reassessed tomorrow, and if improved, it suggests chemical pneumonitis, and antibiotics can be discontinued. The patient will maintain on propofol to assess mental status periodically and undergo daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).

2. Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS): The patient is likely experiencing ETOH withdrawal, which is consistent with the timing. He is increasingly tachycardic, agitated, and tremulous on the floor prior to ERCP. Other potential causes of altered mental status include hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient will be maintained on propofol to assess mental status periodically, undergo a daily spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and have input/output monitoring.
2. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AMS): The patient likely has ETOH withdrawal, as indicated by increased tachycardia, agitation, and tremors prior to ERCP. Other potential causes such as hepatic encephalopathy should also be considered, given the patient's history of alcohol use and the timing of symptoms. The patient"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, secondary to fluid overload and pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has significant increases in purulent secretions via endotracheal tube, suggesting a high risk for developing VAP. Antibiotics have been initiated, but the patient's response to treatment will need to be closely monitored.

2. Aspiration pneumonitis: There is concern for aspiration due to witnessed aspiration and the presence of thick yellow secretions. This can lead to further lung injury and worsening of respiratory function.

3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol use may put them at risk for alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of withdrawal is important.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient's lipase levels are significantly decreased, indicating acute pancreatitis. This can be managed by maintaining the patient NPO (nothing by mouth) and considering the placement of a postpyloric tube for nutrition.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and critical illness increase the risk for DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, have been initiated.

6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for stress-related gastrointestinal"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of recurrent ethanol (ETOH) pancreatitis who was transferred to the ICU for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient had a common bile duct (CBD) stricture, which was stented. The patient remains intubated due to agitation from ETOH withdrawal.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Intubation/Respiratory failure: The patient continues to have purulent secretions and increased bilateral opacities on chest X-ray, which are concerning for pneumonia (PNA) on the right. The patient will continue to be treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Antibiotics will be continued, and a daily sedation vacation (SBT) will be performed to assess readiness for extubation.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS): The patient's symptoms are consistent with ETOH withdrawal, and he may also have hepatic encephalopathy. The patient will continue to receive fentanyl/midazolam, which should cover withdrawal symptoms and allow the patient to be out of sedation.
3. Acute ETOH pancreatitis: The patient's lipase levels are improving with intravenous fluids (IVFs). The patient's trend in liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase levels is positive post-procedure. IVF boluses will be continued to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and urine"

   Assessment and Plan
   48M with h/o recurrent etoh pancreatitis transferred here for ERCP,
   found to have CBD stricture, now s/p stent, and remains intubated due
   to agitation from ETOH withdrawal.
   .
   # Intubation/Respiratory failure:  Continued purulent secretions,
   increased bilateral opactities on CXR consistent with pleural effusion
   and consolidation on right, and consolidation vs. atelectasis on left.
   WBC increasing from low baseline, possibly suggestive of worsening
   infection. Sputum cx growing S. pneumo, so there is concern for
   parapneumonic effusion vs. empyema. Prognosis affected by alcohol
   history and resultant immunosuppression.
   - cover S. pneumo with CTX, continue vancomycin until more culture data
   available
   - D/C cefepime, cipro given known S. pneumo
   - CT to evaluate pleural effusion (loculations)
   - attempt bedside thoracentesis
   - pleural effusion most likely related to infection, but will maintain
   TBB even to slightly positive today
   - daily SBT
   - f/u blood cx
   - add on diff
   .
   # AMS: Initially c/w ETOH withdrawal, now more likely related to
   sedation.  Can also consider hepatic encephalopathy.  Last known drink
   was [**2119-12-15**].
   - continue fent/midaz, which should cover withdrawal and patient out of
   window for severe reaction
   - consider weaning sedation after workup complete (mon)
   - MVI/F/T
   - Social work when extubated
   .
   # Acute ETOH pancreatitis:  Lipase improving.  Pt found to have CBD
   stricture, now s/p stent.  TB improving daily. Likely also has
   underlying cirrhosis given ETOH history, spider angiomas on exam.
   - trend LFTs and lipase, way down post-procedure
   - cont IVF boluses for MAP>65 and UOP>30cc/hr

   complicated parapneumonic effusion given rise in WBC, question of
   increasing effusion on chest film.  Plan to send for noncontrast CT of
   the chest to evaluate further.  Possible diagnostic thorocentesis later
   today.  Continue fentanyl/versed.  Continue ventilatory support.
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES):  On

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 97/58 to 117/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 12. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 16 cmH2O.

The patient has been suctioned for thick, tan lower airway secretions. The physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the right base and rhonchi bilaterally. The patient also has right lower extremity edema of 1+ and left lower extremity edema of 1+. 

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 13.8 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, and elevated troponin-T levels of 0.02. Imaging shows a chest X-ray taken on [**2119-12-21**] 11:25 PM, and microbiology indicates sparse growth of strep pneumoniae in the sputum sample.

The assessment and plan include pneumonia caused by pneumococcus, for which antibiotics will be tailored based on sensitivity. There is concern about a complicated parapneumonic effusion, as indicated by the rise in white blood cell count and potential increasing effusion on the chest film. A noncontrast CT of the chest will be sent to evaluate further, and a diagnostic thoracentesis may be performed later today. Ventilatory support will continue, along with fentanyl and versed infusions.

The patient is also diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal, for which versed drip will be continued. Acute pancreatitis is present, and plans include placement of a postpyloric tube and initiation of tube feeds. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement will optimize access.

In ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and line management are addressed. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The need for restraints is reviewed, and the patient's code status is full code. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU, and the total time spent with the patient is 45 minutes."

   - cover S. pneumo with CTX, continue vancomycin until more culture data
   available
   - D/C cefepime, cipro given known S. pneumo
   - CT to evaluate pleural effusion (loculations)

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of recurrent alcohol use and pancreatitis. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure and has undergone several interventions, including thoracentesis, PICC line placement, and post-pyloric feeding tube placement. The patient is intubated and sedated, with ongoing respiratory support.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has purulent secretions, increased bilateral opacities on CXR consistent with pleural effusion and consolidation on the right side, and consolidation vs. atelectasis on the left side. Sputum culture is growing S. pneumoniae, raising concern for parapneumonic effusion or empyema.

2. Alcohol withdrawal: Initially suspected to be due to ETOH withdrawal, now more likely related to sedation. Consider hepatic encephalopathy as well. Last known drink was on [**2119-12-15**].

3. Acute pancreatitis: Lipase improving. Patient found to have CBD stricture, now stented. TB improving daily. Likely also has underlying cirrhosis given ETOH history, spider angiomas on exam.

4. Pleural effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion that is most likely related to infection, but will maintain TBB even if slightly positive today. CT to evaluate pleural effusion loculations is planned.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of recurrent alcohol use who was transferred to the ICU for an ERCP procedure. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation due to sedation and agitation. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and has a pleural effusion that was tapped yesterday, which is not concerning for empyema. He also has acute pancreatitis and a common bile duct stricture that has been stented. The patient's liver enzymes and lipase levels are improving daily. He likely has underlying cirrhosis given his alcohol history and spider angiomas on examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient has a primary obstacle to extubation due to sedation and streptococcal pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the pneumonia worsens or if the patient is not successfully weaned off sedation.
2. Alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures): The patient has a history of alcohol use and is currently sedated and intubated. If sedation is decreased, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens.
3. Acute pancreatitis: Although the patient's lipase levels are improving, there is still a risk of complications related to pancreatitis, such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of recurrent alcohol use, who was transferred to the ICU for an ERCP procedure. He was found to have a common bile duct (CBD) stricture and underwent stent placement. The patient remains intubated due to agitation from alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's chief complaint is hypoxic respiratory failure. Over the past 24 hours, the patient underwent thoracentesis, PICC line placement, conversion of antibiotics, and evaluation of the right chest with a CT scan. The patient also had a post-pyloric feeding tube placement scheduled for the following day.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were cefepime, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for sedation and pain management. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 109/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -43 mL, with total intake and output being 1,297 mL and 1,340 mL, respectively.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL. Blood cultures have grown Streptococcus pneumoniae, leading to concerns for a parapneumonic effusion versus empyema. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
1. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient has purulent secretions, increased bilateral opacities on chest X-ray consistent with pleural effusion and consolidation on the right side, and consolidation or atelectasis on the left side. The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, possibly suggesting worsening infection. Sputum culture growing S. pneumoniae raises concerns for parapneumonic effusion versus empyema. Prognosis is affected by alcohol history and resultant immunosuppression.
- Cover S. pneumoniae with ceftriaxone, continue vancomycin until more culture data available.
- Discontinue cefepime and cipro due to known S. pneumoniae resistance.
- CT scan to evaluate pleural effusion (loculations).
- Attempt bedside thoracentesis.
- Pleural effusion most likely related to infection, but maintain thoracic tube placement even if slightly positive today.
- Daily sedation vacation testing (SBT).
- Follow-up blood cultures.
- Add-on differential.

","The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of pneumonia, aspiration, alcohol withdrawal, pancreatitis, and acute kidney injury. 

During the 24-hour period, the patient underwent thoracentesis and had a pleural fluid analysis done. The patient also had a PICC line placed and received multiple antibiotics for better Streptococcus pneumoniae coverage. A CT chest was ordered to evaluate the right chest, and a post-pyloric feeding tube placement was planned for the next day.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and intubated.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 43 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving fluids intravenously at a rate of 1,297 mL, with an output of 1,340 mL including 500 mL of urine. 

The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance is 34"

   # Intubation/Respiratory failure:
   Patient improving and passed SBP.
   - Extubation today, seems to be doing very well so far.
   - Aggressive chest PT
   - Incentive spirometry
   - Continue diuresis with 10mg IV furosemide to optimize for extubation
   # RUE Edema: Concerning for DVT in PICC line.
   - RUE U/S

   - F/u S. pneumo sensitivities and narrow abx coverage per sensitivities
   # Pleural effusion
   Exudative though with pH 7.35 so not concerning for empyema, no
   indication for chest tube. Likely parapneumonic effusion.
   - Repeat CXR in [**12-27**] days to ensure resolution of effusion, sooner if
   any clinical change
   # Acute ETOH pancreatitis:  Lipase improving.  Pt found to have CBD
   stricture, now s/p stent.  Enzymes improving daily. Likely also has
   underlying cirrhosis given ETOH history, spider angiomas on exam.
   -continue to trend LFTs and lipase
   -no IVF today as will attempt to diurese
   -Pending a swallow evaluation, will consider advancing diet likely
   tomorrow
   -Hold on tube feeds
   # AMS: Initially c/w ETOH withdrawal, now more likely related to
   sedation.  Can also consider hepatic encephalopathy.  Last known drink
   was [**2119-12-15**]. Mental status much improved currently, pt responding to
   questions appropriately and pt seems oriented to self and place.

   # Bilary obstruction  Improving s/p stent placement
   -Monitor for sx and abdominal exam
   # Transaminitis/elevate INR
   Could be part of obstructive picture and improving s/p stent; however

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of recurrent alcohol use who was transferred to the ICU for an ERCP procedure. He presented with pancreatitis and alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient underwent biliary stenting and remains intubated due to sedation and agitation. He has shown improvement and passed the spontaneous breathing trial (SBP). The plan is to extubate him today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, but he is improving and passed the SBP. Extubation is planned today.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has streptococcus growing in his sputum, indicating pneumonia. He will be covered with ceftriaxone and vancomycin until more culture data is available.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an exudative pleural effusion, which is likely parapneumonic. It does not require chest tube placement. Repeat chest X-ray will be done in 7 days to ensure resolution.
4. Acute ETOH Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, likely related to alcohol abuse. His lipase levels are improving, and he has undergone stenting for a CBD stricture.
5. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient initially presented with signs of alcohol withdrawal, but his mental status has improved, and he is now more likely sedated.

   48M with h/o recurrent etoh pancreatitis transferred here for ERCP,
   found to have CBD stricture, now s/p stent, and remains intubated due
   to sedation and agitation when sedation decreased.
   # Intubation/Respiratory failure:
   Patient improving and passed SBP.
   - Extubation today, seems to be doing very well so far.
   - Aggressive chest PT
   - Incentive spirometry
   - Continue diuresis with 10mg IV furosemide to optimize for extubation
   # RUE Edema: Concerning for DVT in PICC line.
   - RUE U/S
   # Pneumonia, streptococcus growing in sputum
   - cover S. pneumo with CTX, continue vancomycin until more culture data
   available
   - F/u S. pneumo sensitivities and narrow abx coverage per sensitivities
   # Pleural effusion
   Exudative though with pH 7.35 so not concerning for empyema, no
   indication for chest tube. Likely parapneumonic effusion.
   - Repeat CXR in [**12-27**] days to ensure resolution of effusion, sooner if
   any clinical change
   # Acute ETOH pancreatitis:  Lipase improving.  Pt found to have CBD
   stricture, now s/p stent.  Enzymes improving daily. Likely also has
   underlying cirrhosis given ETOH history, spider angiomas on exam.
   -continue to trend LFTs and lipase
   -no IVF today as will attempt to diurese
   -Pending a swallow evaluation, will consider advancing diet likely
   tomorrow
   -Hold on tube feeds
   # AMS: Initially c/w ETOH withdrawal, now more likely related to
   sedation.  Can also consider hepatic encephalopathy.  Last known drink
   was [**2119-12-15**]. Mental status much improved currently, pt responding to
   questions appropriately and pt seems oriented to self and place.
   -Monitor
   # Bilary obstruction  Improving s/p stent placement
   -Monitor for sx and abdominal exam
   # Transaminitis/elevate INR
   Could be part of obstructive picture and improving s/p stent; however
   should consider w/u for alcoholic hepatitis/cirrhosis. Does not have
   abdominal imaging here. INR also elevated but could be [**12-26**] nutritional
   deficits.
   -Monitor for signs of bleeding
   # Alcoholism
   - MVI/F/T
   - Social work today
   # FEN: no IVF, diuresing; hold off enteral feeds for now as may be able

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 48M EtOH pancreatitis, CBD stent, etoh
   withdrawal, pneumonia. Thoracentesis c/w parapneumonic effusion, not
   empyema. Diuresed well post lasix.  Extubated this am.
   Exam notable for AF  BP 107/53  HR 60 RR 13 sat 96% RA  Alert. Follows
   simple commands. Coarse BS B. RRR s1s2 faint SM. Soft +BS. NT, 3+
   edema. RUE > LUE edema. Labs notable for WBC 10K, HCT 40, K+ 4.3,
   Cr 0.6.
   Agree with plan to manage pneumococcal pneumonia with CTX/vanco pending
    sputum sensitivities. He is now extubated, doing well. Encourage IC,
   aggressive chest PT, continue nebs.  For pancreatitis, will monitor abd
   exam while following labs. Has stent for CBD stricture.  Will check RUE
   US given risk for PICC-associated clot. Will assess swallow as more
   alert.  If fails, or if pancreatic enzymes increase post- diet, would
   place post-pyloric DHT and initiate TFS for nutrition.
   Continue MVI/thiamine folate. Remainder of plan as outlined above. ICU:
   sq hep, PPI, assess swallow when more alert.
   Patient is critically ill

","The patient's medical history includes pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, and pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated due to sedation and agitation. They have a history of recurrent alcohol-related pancreatitis and were transferred for an ERCP, which revealed a common bile duct stricture. The patient underwent stenting and remains intubated.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 100/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a medical history.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. There are also elevated levels of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, amylase, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase, calcium, and magnesium.

The patient's plan includes extubation, aggressive chest physical therapy, incentive spirometry, and diuresis with furosemide to optimize for extubation. The patient's right upper extremity edema is concerning for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and an ultrasound of the right upper extremity is ordered. The patient's pneumonia is being covered with ceftriaxone, and vancomycin will be continued until more culture data is available."

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of recurrent ethanol (ETOH) use, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. He also has acute pancreatitis, a pleural effusion, alcohol withdrawal, cholestasis, and coagulopathy. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and had a common bile duct (CBD) stricture with subsequent stent placement. He remains intubated due to sedation and agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary obstacle to extubation is likely sedation, along with the presence of streptococcal pneumonia. Pleural effusion was tapped yesterday and is not concerning for empyema.
2. Pneumonia: Streptococcus is growing in the sputum, so coverage for S. pneumoniae should be provided.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an exudative pleural effusion with a pH of 7.35, which is not concerning for empyema. It is likely a parapneumonic effusion.
4. Acute ETOH Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, and his lipase levels are improving. He was found to have a CBD stricture, which has been stented.
5. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient initially presented with signs consistent with alcohol withdrawal, but now"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for ERCP due to recurrent episodes of alcoholic pancreatitis. He underwent biliary stenting and remains intubated due to sedation and agitation when sedation is decreased. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right upper extremity, pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, acute pancreatitis, pleural effusion, alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens), cholestasis, coagulopathy, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was initially intubated due to sedation and agitation, indicating severe respiratory distress. It is crucial to monitor his respiratory status and continue aggressive chest physiotherapy and incentive spirometry to prevent further complications.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a complete occlusion of the right cephalic vein with thrombus. Anticoagulation therapy should be initiated promptly to prevent the progression of the clot and potential embolization.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be provided based on the sensitivity results to treat the infection effectively.
4. Pleural effusion: The patient has an exudative pleural effusion likely secondary to pneumonia. Monitoring the effusion's resolution with repeat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, who was admitted to the ICU for recurrent episodes of ethanol pancreatitis. He underwent an ERCP procedure and was found to have a common bile duct (CBD) stricture, which was stented. The patient remains intubated due to sedation and agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has shown improvement since extubation. However, there is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient develops further complications or if extubation fails.
2. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has complete occlusion of the right cephalic vein with thrombus, indicating a potential DVT. This could lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately.
3. Pneumonia: Streptococcus pneumoniae is growing in the patient's sputum, indicating a possible pneumonia infection. This requires appropriate antibiotic coverage.
4. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an exudative pleural effusion, which may be parapneumonic in nature. Monitoring for resolution and considering further interventions if necessary.
5. Acute Ethanol Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis likely related to alcohol abuse. Enzyme levels are improving, but there is a risk of complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
6. Cholestasis: The patient"

   jugular and
   right subclavian veins are patent with no evidence of deep venous
   thrombosis.

   48M with h/o recurrent etoh pancreatitis transferred here for ERCP,
   found to have CBD stricture, now s/p stent, and remains intubated due
   to sedation and agitation when sedation decreased.
   # Intubation/Respiratory failure:
   Pt s/p extubation and doing quite well from a respiratory standpoint.
   - Continue Aggressive chest PT
   - Continue Incentive spirometry
   - PT consult and get patient OOB to chair and beyond
   - Hold on lasix as pt seems to be autodiuresing.
   # RUE DVT: Complete occlusion, significant edema, and association with
   PICC warrants anticoagulation.
   -DC heparin gtt
   -START lovenox 90mg SC Q12H
   -R PICC pulled
   -New L PICC in place
   # Pneumonia, streptococcus growing in sputum
   - cover S. pneumo with CTX, continue vancomycin until more culture data
   available
   - F/u S. pneumo sensitivities and narrow abx coverage per sensitivities
   - Called lab today, they mentioned speciation will be ready by tomorrow
   [**2119-12-28**]
   # Pleural effusion
   Exudative though with pH 7.35 so not concerning for empyema, no
   indication for chest tube. Likely parapneumonic effusion.
   - Repeat CXR in [**12-27**] days to ensure resolution of effusion, sooner if
   any clinical change
   # Acute ETOH pancreatitis:  Lipase worsening acutely. Likely also has
   underlying cirrhosis given ETOH history, spider angiomas on exam.
   -continue to trend LFTs and lipasew
   -Make NPO for now
   -no IVF, continue to autodiurese
   -Will consider advancing diet likely tomorrow
   -Hold on tube feeds
   # AMS: Mental status worse this morning. Consider hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Last known drink was [**2119-12-15**] therefore unlikely to be
   acutely withdrawing. Consider multifactorial etiology with prolonged
   ICU stay, acute infection.
   -Monitor mental status
   -Check ammonia
   -RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for cirrhosis
   # Bilary obstruction  Improving s/p stent placement
   -Monitor for sx and abdominal exam
   # Transaminitis/elevate INR
   Could be part of obstructive picture and improving s/p stent; however
   should consider w/u for alcoholic hepatitis/cirrhosis. Does not have
   abdominal imaging here. INR also elevated but could be [**12-26**] nutritional
   deficits. LFTs improving overall.
   -Monitor for signs of bleeding
   # Alcoholism
   - MVI/F/T
   - Social work recs
   # FEN: no IVF, autodiuresing; hold off enteral feeds for now, replete

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. He was transferred to the ICU for an ERCP procedure due to a common bile duct (CBD) stricture, and subsequently underwent stent placement. The patient remains intubated due to sedation and agitation when sedation is decreased.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated but has been extubated and is doing well from a respiratory standpoint. The plan is to continue aggressive chest physiotherapy, incentive spirometry, and gradually progress the patient out of bed.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): A complete occlusion of the right cephalic vein with thrombus has been identified, along with significant edema. Anticoagulation therapy has been initiated to prevent further clot formation, and the right PICC line has been removed.

3. Pneumonia: Streptococcus pneumoniae is growing in the sputum culture, so coverage with ceftriaxone and vancomycin has been continued until more culture data is available. Antibiotic sensitivity results will be used to narrow the antibiotic coverage.

4. Pleural effusion: An exudative effusion has been identified, but it is not concerning for empyema as the pH is within normal range. No chest tube is indicated, and the plan is to"
