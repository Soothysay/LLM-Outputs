   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaudice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # HYPOTENSION
   - Consider midodrine?
   # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - Consider eval for hypercoaguable states, ? malignancy
   - f/u final read of CT-PA and CXR
   # Dyspnea: pt w/ baseline SOB, on O2 at home, unknown amount. Now w/
   increasing SOB, possibly [**2-7**] to PE, but differential includes CHF, MI,
   PNA, COPD exacerbation, restrictive ascites.
   - Pt satting well, breathing comfortably, continue to monitor
   - check BNP
   - consider ECHO for signs of R-heart failure, ? secondary to PE
   - home meds for COPD/ASTHMA
   - pt w/ HTN, on lasix, w/o hx of known CHF, eval for diastolic heart
   failure w/ECHO as above; continue home dose for now and consider
   diuresis pending further work-up
   - cycle CEs and repeat EKG
   # Diarrhea/Vomiting/Jaundice: diarrhea w/o abd pain, fever, chills,
   less likely to be infection though could still be c-diff, viral gastro,
   or other. Jaundice, elevated ALKP, suggest obstructive process, but US
   showed no biliary dilation. AST/ALT ration also fits acute alcoholic
   hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture.
   -check c-diff
   -f/u final read of u/s
   - f/u final read of CT-scan
   - consider ERCP or HIDA scan
   - consider ABX if develops fevers, or new info from CTs.
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   # Tachycardia: has afib at baseline, though not sure when he is in or
   out of it. Most likely fast rate from missing his home doses of
   medications. Sepsis/Pain could worsen tachycardia,but pt is
   comfortable, no pain, no fever, no leukocytosis.
   - restart home meds (Dilt, Sotalol)
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds
   # HTN - Well controlled on home meds. Will continue home meds, and
   either treat nausea for POs or adjust to IV as needed for appropriate
   BP control.
   # Code status - DNR/DNI per patient records, needs to be confirmed w/
   patient

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with symptoms including diarrhea, jaundice, worsening shortness of breath, and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) as well as right-sided colitis.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, PE, dyspnea, and jaundice. The assessment plan includes considering midodrine for hypotension, evaluating for hypercoagulable states, and further investigation into the cause of the PE. For dyspnea, the patient's oxygen saturation is currently at 89%, and they are comfortable without distress. Monitoring is recommended along with checking B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, performing an echocardiogram (ECHO) for signs of right heart failure secondary to PE, and evaluating for diastolic heart failure.

Regarding the diarrhea, vomiting, and jaundice, the cause is unclear, but possible causes include infection (such as Clostridium difficile), viral gastroenteritis, or an obstructive process. Further evaluation with a final read of the ultrasound and CT scan, as well as considering an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan, is advised.

   # Hypotension/Low urine output
 borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - Sepsis remains a likely cause of hypotension, especially given GPC in
   clusters on blood culture.  Will follow speciation
   - Vanco 1gm q12.
   - Spin urine sediment, urine lytes and eos.
   - Intra-abdominal pressure, lactate
   - if studies c/w HRS, would start octreotide, midodrine, 25% albumin
   tx.
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - f/u final read of CT-scan
   - discuss if further workup required per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds

    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings
   could also represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic

The patient's current medical issues include hypotension/low urine output, suspected borderline hepatorenal syndrome, sepsis, PE, dyspnea, atrial fibrillation/tachycardia, COPD/asthma, and fecal/urinary/gastrointestinal (FEN/GI) issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hypotension and low urine output, progression of sepsis, development of new PEs or worsening of existing PE, exacerbation of COPD/asthma, further deterioration of liver function, and potential complications related to the patient's colitis.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly blood pressure and heart rate, as well as his urine output and electrolyte levels. Timely administration of antibiotics for sepsis and appropriate management of the patient's respiratory status are crucial. Close monitoring of liver function and consideration of interventions such as octreotide and midodrine may be necessary if hepatorenal syndrome is confirmed. Regular reassessment of the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaudice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypotension/Low urine output
 borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - Sepsis remains a likely cause of hypotension, especially given GPC in
   clusters on blood culture.  Will follow speciation
   - Vanco 1gm q12.
   - Spin urine sediment, urine lytes and eos.
   - Intra-abdominal pressure, lactate
   - if studies c/w HRS, would start octreotide, midodrine, 25% albumin
   tx.
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - f/u final read of CT-scan
   - discuss if further workup required per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings
   could also represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - f/u final read of CT-PA and CXR
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mosly due to chronic COPD
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Tachycardia: has afib at baseline, though not sure when he is in or
   out of it. Most likely fast rate from missing his home doses of
   medications. Sepsis/Pain could worsen tachycardia,but pt is
   comfortable, no pain, no fever, no leukocytosis.
   - restart home meds (Dilt, Sotalol)
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds
   # HTN - Well controlled on home meds. Will continue home meds, and
   either treat nausea for POs or adjust to IV as needed for appropriate
   BP control.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with symptoms of diarrhea, jaundice, worsening shortness of breath (SOB), and was found to have pulmonary embolism (PE) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), as well as right-sided colitis. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing hypotension and low urine output, suggestive of borderline hepatorenal syndrome. The rising creatinine levels and pressures indicate poorly responsive fluid resuscitation. 

Sepsis is considered a likely cause of hypotension, especially given the presence of gram-positive cocci (GPC) in clusters on the blood culture. Antibiotics have been started, and further investigations are planned to determine the source of infection. 

The patient's diarrhea and jaundice may be related to acute alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis, given the abnormal liver enzymes and poor synthetic function. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis. 

The patient has a history of PE, which is consistent with worsening baseline respiratory status and dyspnea on exertion. However, due to the elevated INR, it is unlikely that there are new PE formations, and no clots were seen on the lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI). 

The patient's tachycardia is attributed to missing his home doses of medications and may be exacerbated by se"

   # Hypotension
  Sepsis remains a possible cause of hypotension,
   however coag-neg staph in blood culture is likely contaminant.
   Afebrile with normal WBC.  Lungs are a possible source of infection.
   Ascietes were clear.  Not HRS but similar physiology.  Cortisol
   appropriate.  Lactate normal.
   - Repeat Chest CT.  Sputum culture.  Would treat evidence of PNA with
   Unasyn and Vanc.
   - Stop Vanco 1gm for now as no evidence/source of infection
   - Spin urine sediment, urine lytes and eos.
   - Stop octreotide but continue midodrine, 25% albumin tx.
   - Will discuss further liver w/u with GI
   .
   # ARF
 rising creatinine with muddy brown casts on sediment consistent
   with ATN, likely from hypotension/borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and COPD. He presented with symptoms of diarrhea, jaundice, worsening shortness of breath, and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient also has right-sided colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which could be due to sepsis or other causes. Further evaluation and treatment are required to determine the underlying cause.

2. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient has rising creatinine levels and muddy brown casts on urine sediment, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely caused by hypotension and borderline hepatorenal syndrome. It is important to continue keeping the blood pressures up and monitor creatinine levels.

3. Diarrhea/Jaundice: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and jaundice may be related to liver dysfunction. Normal abdominal imaging and AST/ALT ratio suggest possible acute alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Further evaluation by hepatology is recommended.

4. PE: The patient has a history of worsening respiratory status, dyspnea on exertion, and shortness of breath. While the CT scan showed no new PE, there is a possibility of old PE or septic emboli. The patient is already anticoagulated, so specific therapy may not be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with symptoms of diarrhea, jaundice, worsening shortness of breath, and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) along with right-sided colitis. The patient is currently in the ICU for stabilization. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Low urine output: The patient is experiencing hypotension and low urine output, which could be due to sepsis or borderline hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The rising creatinine levels and poorly responsive pressures indicate a possible kidney dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: The presence of Gram-positive cocci in clusters on the blood culture suggests a bacterial infection, leading to sepsis. Vancomycin has been started to treat the infection.
3. Jaundice/Diarrhea: The patient's jaundice and diarrhea could be related to liver dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, such as acute alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Hepatotoxic medications should be avoided, and a follow-up CT scan is recommended.
4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's worsening respiratory status, dyspnea on exertion, and shortness of breath may indicate a PE. However, with an INR of 3, it is unlikely that new clots"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaundice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypoxia
 Currently with normal saturation on room air.  Effusion on
   CT suggestive of volume overload.
   - Currently no evidence of pneumonia.  Hold on antibiotics
   - goal to keep pressures elevated and avoid excess IVF (goal even to
   slightly negative)
   - would not tap as unlikely to be infected
   # Possible UTI: 39 WBC on sediment, but likely related ATN.  Culture
   negative, Afebrile, no white count, no evidence of UTI on exam.
   - D/C macrobid
   - follow cultures
   # Hypotension
  Likely a combination of dehydration from diarrhea and
   decreased forward flow from liver dysfunction.  Sepsis remains a
   possible cause of hypotension, however coag-neg staph in blood culture
   is likely contaminant.  Afebrile with normal WBC.  Lungs generally
   clear by CT.  Ascietes were clear.  Not HRS but similar physiology.
   Cortisol appropriate.  Lactate normal.
   - Hold on antibiotics as no evidence of infection
   - Continue midodrine, 25% albumin tx.
   - follow lactate
   - IV thiamine
   .
   # ARF
 rising creatinine with muddy brown casts on sediment consistent
   with ATN, likely from hypotension/borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - continue to keep pressures up.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds as necessary
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - further workup per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  Clots not significiant enough to
   explain hypotension.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings could also
   represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - Will start heparin for INR < 2.
   - Outpatient follow up for suspicious lung lesion on CT
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mostly due to chronic
   COPD.  Echo without evidence of CHF.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Afib/tachycardia: stable.
   - hold Dilt, Sotalol
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with symptoms including diarrhea, jaundice, worsening shortness of breath (SOB), and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). 

The patient's current medical complications include hypoxia, possible urinary tract infection (UTI), hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), diarrhea/jaundice, PE, dyspnea, atrial fibrillation/tachycardia, and COPD/asthma. 

Hypoxia: The patient is currently not experiencing hypoxia as his oxygen saturation is normal on room air. The CT chest suggests volume overload, but there is no evidence of pneumonia. Antibiotics have been held.

Possible UTI: The patient has a low white blood cell count in the urine sediment, but there are no other signs of a urinary tract infection. Cultures have been ordered and macrobid has been discontinued.

Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of dehydration from diarrhea and decreased forward flow from liver dysfunction. Sepsis is still a possible cause of hypotension, but coag-neg staph in blood culture is likely a contaminant. Antibiotics have been held, midodrine and 25"

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and COPD. He presented with symptoms of diarrhea, jaundice, worsening shortness of breath, and was found to have pulmonary embolism (PE) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) along with right-sided colitis.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxia, hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), jaundice, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of bilirubin, liver enzymes, and creatinine. Imaging studies reveal moderate bilateral pleural effusion, bibasilar alveolar opacities, atelectasis, bronchiectasis, and fatty liver.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is currently stable with normal oxygen saturation on room air. No evidence of pneumonia, so antibiotics are held. Goal is to keep pressures elevated and avoid excess intravenous fluids.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the note mentions several significant events that occurred within a 24-hour period. The patient desaturated to the 50s and became hypotensive with a blood pressure in the 70s while sleeping. This prompted the placement of the patient on CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure). Despite this intervention, the patient continued to desaturate to the 70s and remained hypotensive. In response, the head of the bed was raised to a 30-degree angle, which resulted in improved oxygen saturation levels and blood pressure readings in the 90s to 110s. 

The patient also underwent a cortisol stimulation test, which yielded normal results. No known drug allergies were reported. The last dose of antibiotics administered was vancomycin on [**2156-9-30**] at 08:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
- Heart rate: 75 bpm (with a range of 67-87 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 103/63 mmHg (with a range of 72-111 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (with a range of 13-28 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on BiPAP mask

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaudice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypotension
  Sepsis remains a possible cause of hypotension,
   however coag-neg staph in blood culture is likely contaminant.
   Afebrile with normal WBC.  Lungs are a possible source of infection.
   Ascietes were clear.  Not HRS but similar physiology.  Cortisol
   appropriate.  Lactate normal.
   - Repeat Chest CT.  Sputum culture.  Would treat evidence of PNA with
   Unasyn and Vanc.
   - Stop Vanco 1gm for now as no evidence/source of infection
   - Spin urine sediment, urine lytes and eos.
   - Stop octreotide but continue midodrine, 25% albumin tx.
   - Will discuss further liver w/u with GI
   .
   # ARF
 rising creatinine with muddy brown casts on sediment consistent
   with ATN, likely from hypotension/borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - continue to keep pressures up.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds as necessary
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - f/u final read of CT-scan
   - discuss if further workup required per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings
   could also represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.  Holding coumadin now
   - Will start heparin for INR < 2.
   - f/u final read of CT-PA and CXR
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mostly due to chronic
   COPD.  Echo without evidence of CHF.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Afib/tachycardia: stable.
   - hold Dilt, Sotalol
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds
   # FEN/GI:  Lytes PRN, Will replete albumin as above.
   # PPX: therapeutic INR, diarrhea

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with symptoms of diarrhea, jaundice, worsening shortness of breath (SOB), and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) along with right-sided colitis. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), diarrhea/jaundice, PE, dyspnea, atrial fibrillation/tachycardia, and COPD/asthma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and abnormal LFTs raise concerns for sepsis, although the presence of coag-neg staph in blood culture is likely a contaminant.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has rising creatinine levels with muddy brown casts on sediment, consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely due to hypotension/borderline hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has evidence of worsening baseline respiratory status, dyspnea on exertion, and SOB. However, the INR of 3 makes it unlikely to have formed new PE, possibly an old PE or mixing artifact. No clots were seen"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaundice, worsening

   # Renal failure: 39 WBC, many muddy brown casts on sediment, but likely
   related ATN.  Culture negative, Afebrile, no white count, no evidence
   of UTI on exam. Stable for the past day. Baseline 0.9.
   -          follow daily creatinine
   -          would avoid aggressive diuresis in the setting of ? unstable
   renal function
   # Hypotension
  Likely [**2-7**] to dehydration in setting of severe
   diarrhea along with decompensation of liver disease. Improved since
   admission but  still somewhat tenuous.
   - Hold off on diuresis
   - Hold on antibiotics as no evidence of infection
   - Continue midodrine
   .
   # Jaundice/Liver disease: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also
   fits acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic
   picture, especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice. Appears
   eu to somewhat hypervolemic today with peripheral edema on exam and CXR
   with effusion. CT abdomen notable for area of increased density in
   liver.
   - further workup per hepatology to include outpatient MRI to further
   characterize abnormal area within liver.
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   - clinical exams to eval fluid status
   .
   #. Diarrhea: Persists but improving, likely viral etiology.
   -          replete fluids prn
   -          monitor
   -          follow up any remaining stool studies
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  Clots not significiant enough to
   explain hypotension.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings could also
   represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- He presented with symptoms including diarrhea, jaundice, worsening shortness of breath (SOB), and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE), abnormal liver function tests (LFTs), right-sided colitis, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- The patient's renal function is stable, with a creatinine level of 1.6.
- He is experiencing hypotension, which is likely due to dehydration in the setting of severe diarrhea and decompensation of liver disease.
- The patient has jaundice and liver disease, with an abnormal area in the liver noted on CT abdomen. Further workup is needed to characterize this abnormality.
- He has persistent diarrhea, which is improving and likely of viral etiology.
- The patient has a PE, which is consistent with his worsening respiratory status and dyspnea on exertion. However, it is unlikely to have formed new PE, possibly an old PE or mixing artifact. No significant clots were found on lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS).
- The patient's atrial fibrillation/tachycardia is stable, and he is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic range on coumad"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo M w hx of afib and COPD, w 1 week diarrhea, jaundice, worsening
   SOB, and found to have PE and abnormal LFTs and right-sided colitis.
   # Hypoxia
 Currently with normal saturation on room air.  Effusion on
   CT suggestive of volume overload.
   - Currently no evidence of pneumonia.  Hold on antibiotics
   - goal to keep pressures elevated and avoid excess IVF (goal even to
   slightly negative)
   - would not tap as unlikely to be infected
   # Possible UTI: 39 WBC on sediment, but likely related ATN.  Culture
   negative, Afebrile, no white count, no evidence of UTI on exam.
   - D/C macrobid
   - follow cultures
   # Hypotension
  Likely a combination of dehydration from diarrhea and
   decreased forward flow from liver dysfunction.  Sepsis remains a
   possible cause of hypotension, however coag-neg staph in blood culture
   is likely contaminant.  Afebrile with normal WBC.  Lungs generally
   clear by CT.  Ascietes were clear.  Not HRS but similar physiology.
   Cortisol appropriate.  Lactate normal.
   - Hold on antibiotics as no evidence of infection
   - Continue midodrine, 25% albumin tx.
   - follow lactate
   - IV thiamine
   .
   # ARF
 rising creatinine with muddy brown casts on sediment consistent
   with ATN, likely from hypotension/borderline hepatorenal syndrome.  Has
   rising cr and pressures that are poorly responsive to IVF.  Patient was
   previously hypertensive so current MAPs are far lower than what the
   kidneys are accustomed to.
   - continue to keep pressures up.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose meds as necessary
   .
   Diarrhea /Jaundice: Normal abdominal imaging. AST/ALT ratio also fits
   acute alcoholic hepatitis, but is low, so could be cirrhotic picture,
   especially given poor synthetic function and jaundice.
   - further workup per hepatiology
   - holding hepatotoxic meds
   .
    # PE: Consistent w/ worsening of baseline resp status, dyspnea on
   exertion and SOB, however, with INR of 3, is unlikely to have formed
   new PE, ? old PE, ?mixing artifact.  Clots not significiant enough to
   explain hypotension.  No clots on LENIs.  Lung findings could also
   represent septic emboli.
   - No specific therapy as pt is already anticoagulated to a therapeutic
   range on coumadin.
   - Will start heparin for INR < 2.
   - Outpatient follow up for suspicious lung lesion on CT
   .
   # Dyspnea: This is mild to resolved, suspect mostly due to chronic
   COPD.  Echo without evidence of CHF.
   - Continue nebulizers PRN
   .
   # Afib/tachycardia: stable.
   - hold Dilt, Sotalol
   - reassess tomorrow and monitor on tele
   # COPD/asthma- pt with worsening SOB, but no acute exacerbation, and
   not in any distress. Small amount of wheezing on exam
   - continue home meds
   # FEN/GI:  Lytes PRN, Will replete albumin as above.
   # PPX: therapeutic INR, diarrhea
   # Code status
 Full code
   # Dispo: MICU pending stabilization

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU with symptoms including diarrhea, jaundice, worsening shortness of breath (SOB), and found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) along with right-sided colitis.

The patient is currently experiencing hypoxia, with normal saturation on room air, but there is evidence of volume overload as shown by effusion on CT. Antibiotics have been held due to lack of evidence of pneumonia. The goal is to keep pressures elevated and avoid excess intravenous fluids (IVF).

There is also a concern for possible urinary tract infection (UTI) with 39 white blood cells (WBC) in the sediment, but it is likely related to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Cultures have been negative, and the patient is afebrile with no white count or evidence of UTI on examination. Macrobid has been discontinued.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which is likely due to a combination of dehydration from diarrhea and decreased forward flow from liver dysfunction. Sepsis remains a possible cause of hypotension, but coag-negative staph in the blood culture is likely a contaminant. The patient"
