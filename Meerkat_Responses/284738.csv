","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) presenting with recurrent blood in rectum per anal (BRBPR) and a hematocrit level of 36%. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have experienced a large arterial bleed from a traumatic sheath pull during mesenteric angiography. The patient required 8 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 3 units of platelets. They were also started on pressure in the emergency department (ED) CT scanner for suspected spinal cord pressure injury. The patient has multiple medical allergies, including codeine, nausea/vomiting, penicillins, and sulfa. They are currently receiving infusions of lorazepam, midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole. The patient has a history of chronic pain, recent GIB, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ischemic heart disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, glaucoma, and celiac disease. The patient's family meeting was held, and their code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI). They are currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) presenting with recurrence of bloody brown pink rectal bleeding (BRBPR) today, and Hct of 36. The patient underwent two mesenteric angiographies on [3-20] and sheath pull, which resulted in dropped pressures to SBP 70s with an enlarging distended abdomen and increased abdominal pain. A CT abdomen revealed a large right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma. The patient also has a history of chronic cough, chronic facial neuralgia, hypothyroidism, glaucoma in the left eye, celiac disease, and is off Aggrenox for 5 days. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 142/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently being monitored with Hct Q2-4H, transfused for HCT drop > 3pts, and has a trauma line and PIV access. Surgery, GI, and IR recommendations have been provided. The patient has a DNR code confirmed with the patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to significant blood loss and ongoing bleeding.
2. Tamponade caused by the large retroperitoneal hematoma.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), presenting with recurrence of bloody brown urine (BRBPR), successful angiography without identified source, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/53 mmHg to 177/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on multiple medications including Aggrenox, Klonopin, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and lorazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB and is currently experiencing BRBPR. This could lead to hypotension and shock if not managed properly.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can worsen if proper respiratory support and clearance of secretions are not provided.
3. Tamponade: The patient's distended abdomen and increased abdominal pain suggest the possibility of cardiac tamponade. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and echocardiogram evaluation are necessary.
4. Lower Extremity Ischemia: The presence of absent pulses in both lower extremities raises concerns for peripheral arterial disease or acute limb ischemia. Urgent vascular consultation and imaging are required.
5. Chronic Pain Management: The patient's chronic facial neural"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding, who presented with recurrent blood pressure instability and a large retroperitoneal bleed. She underwent angiography without identifying the source of bleeding and experienced a large retroperitoneal bleed upon sheath pull. The patient also had aspiration pneumonia and leukocytosis improved after administration of Levofloxacin and Vancomycin. She required dopamine due to hypotension and an enlarging, distended abdomen. A CT abdomen showed a large retroperitoneal bleed. The patient is now showing signs of tamponade. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by productive cough, hypoxia, and positive cultures for Pseudomonas.
2. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient had a large retroperitoneal bleed that required medical intervention. This can lead to hypotension and further complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding, which could recur and result in significant blood loss.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring intervention with dopamine and monitoring of hemoglobin concentration. Persistent hypotension can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Tamponade: The patient is showing signs of tamponade, which is a serious condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), presenting with recurrent blood-tinged brown phlegm, a large right lower pelvic bleed following sheath pull, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential medical complications due to her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, which is a lung infection caused by inhaling foreign material into the lungs. It is characterized by cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. The patient's continued hypoxia and productive cough indicate worsening of the pneumonia. Treatment includes antibiotics, such as levofloxacin, and supportive care like deep breathing exercises and incentive spirometry.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB and currently shows signs of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by hematochezia (blood in stool), brady/hypotension, and tachycardia. The source of the bleed has not been identified despite angiography. Close monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is necessary, and transfusion may be required if the patient's hemoglobin drops below 30. Surgical intervention, such as right hemicolectomy, could be considered if the patient becomes unstable.

3. Tamponade: The patient experienced tamponade due to the large right lower pelvic bleed. Tamponade occurs when fluid or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) who presented with recurrent bloody brown-colored sputum (BRBPR), aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and a large right lower pole (RP) bleed after sheath pull during angiography. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, chronic pain, lower gastrointestinal bleed, and chronic cough. She also has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, chronic facial neuralgia, hypothyroidism, glaucoma, and celiac disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/49 to 164/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is currently at 29% and has been stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and the presence of BRBPR suggest ongoing lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring Hct every 6 hours and transfusing for Hct < 30 are recommended to maintain hemodynamic stability.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonia, which is confirmed by the presence of productive cough and leukocytosis. Cultures with Pseudomonas have been obtained, and the patient is already"
