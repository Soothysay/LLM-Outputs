","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient is currently in the ICU due to severe sepsis and troponin elevation.

The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to increase his hemoglobin concentration from 18.9% to 23.1%. The urine output (UOP) has been trending down, indicating possible acute on chronic renal failure. The creatinine level is also elevated at 2.5 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of diabetes, but is not currently on any diabetes medications. His glucose level is currently at 215 mg/dL. 

The patient's extremities show signs of erythema and warmth, particularly in the right toe, indicating potential localized infection. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed due to swelling in both arms.

The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 35 K/uL. He is being monitored for any bleeding complications.

The patient's cardiac status is significant for ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous endocarditis. His troponin levels are elevated, suggesting ongoing myocardial injury. An echocardiogram (ECHO) has been ordered to assess his cardiac function.

The patient's liver function tests show elevated bilir"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. He presents with severe sepsis, likely secondary to a toe infection. The patient has multiple comorbidities including anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute on chronic renal failure, and diabetes. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood product transfusion, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's severe sepsis may progress to septic shock if not adequately managed. Additionally, there is a concern for other sources of infection such as pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, urinary tract infection, or endocarditis.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and structural heart abnormalities, which increases the risk of cardiac complications like myocardial infarction or heart failure.

3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen due to poor renal perfusion secondary to sepsis and volume depletion. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate fluid management are crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with severe sepsis, chronic renal failure, cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease. He has been receiving ICU care since admission and is currently on multiple medications and infusions. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he is experiencing low blood pressure and high heart rate. The patient has received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to increase his hematocrit level from 18.9% to 23.1%. He has negative upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) despite having asymmetric right upper limb swelling. Blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged except for the noted events. His fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1,499 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving respiratory support with 100% oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and his oxygen saturation (SpO2) remains at 100%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a slightly alkalotic pH, normal partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and adequate oxygen saturation. Physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment of peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic status. Laboratory results show elevated leukocyte count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased blood glucose, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's assessment includes severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, a history"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient was admitted with severe sepsis, likely due to a toe infection, but other sources such as pneumonia, Clostridium difficile, urinary tract infection, and endocarditis are also being evaluated. The patient has troponin elevation, indicating a possible myocardial infarction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/48-115/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving fluids and blood transfusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing severe sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not appropriately managed.
2. Myocardial infarction: The patient has troponin elevation, indicating a possible heart attack. This could worsen the patient's cardiomyopathy and lead to cardiac complications.
3. Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of endocarditis and structurally abnormal valves, there is a risk of endocarditis recurrence.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is severe sepsis. The patient has received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to a low hematocrit level. The ultrasound examination of the lower extremities (UENIs) was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but the patient had asymmetric right upper limb swelling. Blood cultures showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.2 degrees Celsius, current temperature (Tcurrent) of 35.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 110/48 to 115/60 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring parameters include a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) of 98%, and a fluid balance of 1,499 mL input and 72 mL output over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 6.0 g/dL, glucose level of 215 mg/dL, sodium level of 131 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, chloride level of 100 mEq/L, total bilirubin level of 2.5 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL, and troponin T level of 0.33.

The patient has a medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The patient is currently experiencing severe sepsis, likely secondary to a toe infection. There are also concerns for other potential sources of infection such as pneumonia (PNA), Clostridium difficile (C. Diff), urinary tract infection (UTI), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and endocarditis due to structurally abnormal valves.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic physiology. Stress dose steroids have been ordered, and the central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) should be monitored. Levophed would be the preferred pressor if needed, and outpatient blood pressure medications and Lasix have been held.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis but is currently stable without any signs of ascites or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are being managed with transfusions and erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs).

   #Sepsis: Likely [**2-21**] to toe infection, but prudent to eval for other
   sources such as PNA, C. Diff, Urine, SBP, and endocarditis given
   structurally abnormal valves.  APACHE of 26.  Rule out influenza given
   fever and dry cough.  On [**3-8**] grew 2/2 blood cxs with gram+ cocci in
   pairs and clusters.
   - Cover broadly for MRSA and gram negatives/anaerobes given diabetic
   patient with vanco/zosyn, will tailor ABX when final speciation and
   sensitivities are available
   - CVP goal of 8-12mmHg as per protocol but would favor higher CVP's
   given h/o CHF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. He presents with severe sepsis and troponin elevation. He has received 3 units of packed red blood cells due to anemia. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal cardiac enzymes. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/48-115/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases, asymmetric right greater than left arm swelling, erythematous and warm first toe on the right leg, and cool extremities. Neurologic examination is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis likely secondary to toe infection, but other sources such as pneumonia, Clostridium difficile, urinary tract infection, and endocarditis should also be evaluated. Broad coverage for MRSA and gram-negative/anaerobic organisms is recommended.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 90s, indicating hypotension likely due to septic physiology. Stress dose steroids and central venous pressure monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old male with a medical history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. He presented with cellulitis, severe sepsis, and demand ischemia. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected MRSA infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is showing improvement. However, there are several potential medical complications that could arise, including:

1. Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection, likely due to the cellulitis and severe sepsis. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or development of new infections.

2. Endocarditis: Despite the absence of vegetations on TTE, the patient's history of endocarditis and structurally abnormal valves raise the possibility of endocarditis. A TEE may be needed to rule out endocarditis.

3. Osteomyelitis: The patient's deep wound cultures may show growth of Staph aureus, which raises the possibility of osteomyelitis, especially in the presence of diabetes and peripheral vascular disease. Further evaluation with CT R foot may be necessary.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, likely due to poor forward perfusion and sepsis physiology. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate fluid management are crucial.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient presented with cellulitis, severe sepsis, and demand ischemia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/42-159/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and decreased platelet count. The creatinine level is within normal range, but there are elevated levels of lactate, troponin T, CK-MB, and LDH. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, chronic renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient also has structural heart abnormalities and previous endocarditis.

The patient's treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected MRSA infection, stress-dose steroids, and planned surgical intervention for wound debridement. The patient is also being monitored for potential complications such as pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infection, deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","The patient is a 93-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome presenting with cellulitis, severe sepsis, and demand ischemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for MRSA coverage. The patient has completed Enhanced Goal Directed Therapy (EGDT) and is expected to undergo immediate surgery for debridement of the toe infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of endocarditis and is currently being treated for severe sepsis and toe infection. There is a risk of further infections, especially considering his immunocompromised state due to myelodysplastic syndrome.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and is on a pacer. There is a risk of worsening cardiac function, arrhythmias, or demand ischemia due to the patient's overall condition.

3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute on chronic renal failure, which could be exacerbated by sepsis physiology and poor forward perfusion. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.

4. Bleeding: The patient has anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, making him at high risk for bleeding, particularly with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of cardiomyopathy, chronic renal failure, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and anemia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. He has been experiencing fever of unknown origin and requires immediate attention. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a pacemaker inserted due to inconsistent pacer functioning. He is also receiving IV Lasix, prednisone, and other medications as part of his ICU care. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has diminished breath sounds at the bases and cool extremities. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and troponin levels, along with other abnormalities in kidney and liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's condition indicates severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. It is essential to monitor and manage the infection aggressively to prevent further deterioration of organ function.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's diminished breath sounds at the bases suggest possible pneumonia or atelectasis. Frequent auscultation, chest X-rays, and sputum cultures should be performed to identify and treat any respiratory infections promptly.
3. Peripheral vascular complications: The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and critical limb ischemia puts him at risk for further complications such as limb ischemia or gangrene. Close monitoring of the peripheral pulses and regular Doppler ultrasound"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 323**] y/o M w/ h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis,
   cryptogenic cirrhosis, and MDS p/w cellulitis, severe sepsis, and
   troponin elevation.
   .
   #Severe Sepsis: Likely [**2-21**] to toe infection, but prudent to eval for
   other sources such as PNA (unlikely given CXR), C. Diff, Urine (U/A
   negative), SBP (no ascites), and endocarditis given structurally
   abnormal valves.  APACHE of 26.  Rule out influenza given fever and dry
   cough.  On [**3-8**] grew 2/2 blood cxs with gram+ cocci in pairs and
   clusters.
   - Cover broadly for MRSA and gram negatives/anaerobes given diabetic
   patient with vanco/zosyn, will tailor ABX when final speciation and
   sensitivities are available
   - appreciate ID recs (? of osteo and optimal ABX tx)
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBC today given HCT 26 and SvO2 50-60%
   - CVP goal of 14-16 mmHg given h/o CHF
   - MAP goal > 65
   - Prednisone 60mg PO
   - f/u podiatry rec's -> unlikely to debride
   - f/u cxs
   - ECHO today
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Stable, no h/o ascites.  Would not suspect SBP at this
   time.
   - follow clinically
   .
   # Anemia/Myelodysplastic syndrome: Baseline Hct is 22-25, transfusion
   dependent.  Transfused 3 units PRBC [**3-8**].  Is high risk for bleed given
   h/o GAVE
   - follow-hct
   - Will need to redose aranesp at some point (gets q2weeks)
   - continue PPI
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: At or near baseline is 40-60.
   - Continue to trend platelets
   .
   # MI: Has h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy, and pacer.  Trop bump likely
   demand ischemia from anemia and sepsis physiology.  Received 3 units
   PRBCs [**3-8**].
   - r/o with 3 sets CEs
   - Consider repeat Echo for bacteremia
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Likely poor forward perfusion.
   - volume resuscitate to CVP goal
   - follow-UOP
   - Trend Cr
   - Send lytes if needed
   .
   # GAVE/Watermelon stomach
   - continue PPI
   - Trend HCT
   .
   # Diabetes: Not on diabetes medications as outpatient.  Will follow
   finger sticks, and diabetic diet when able.
   - RISS
   .
   # RUE: Swollen, had negative USE of RUE in [**2144**], appears chronic.
   UENIs negative [**2146-3-8**].
   .
   # Pain: not requiring home lidocaine patch
   # FEN: Blood products, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # Access: R-IJ, PIV
   .
   # Code: Full, will discuss further with patient and family in future.
   .
   # Communication: Patient and daughter
   .
   # Disposition: pending resolution of above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 92-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, endocarditis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. He presented with cellulitis, severe sepsis, and troponin elevation. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2146-3-8**] and has had several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. The source of infection is believed to be a toe infection, but other sources such as pneumonia, Clostridium difficile, urinary tract infection, and endocarditis need to be evaluated.
2. Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS): The patient has a history of MDS, which is a group of disorders caused by poorly formed or dysfunctional blood cells. This can lead to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and increased risk of bleeding.
3. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, which means his heart muscle has been damaged due to reduced blood flow. This can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias.
4. Endocarditis: The patient has a history of endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. This can lead to further complications such as septic emboli and heart failure.
