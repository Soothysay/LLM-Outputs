","The patient is a 28-year-old female with systemic mastocytosis who presented to the ICU for a mastocytosis flare. She has been experiencing symptoms consistent with past flares, including chest pain. The cause of her current worsening episode is unclear, but her underlying mastocytosis is likely a contributing factor. The patient initially improved with benadryl and zofran, but her condition has since worsened. She is currently on multiple H1 blockers and reluctant to decrease these medications as she takes them at home.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 123 beats per minute, which is tachycardic. Her blood pressure is 129/88 mmHg, respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. She is in sinus rhythm.

On physical examination, the patient is alert and awake. She has erythema over her skin, which initially improved after receiving benadryl but has since reappeared. There are no focal neurologic findings.

The patient's laboratory results and radiology images are not provided in the progress note. She is currently receiving several medications, including solumedrol, diphenhydramine, ranitidine, hydroxyzine, doxepin, gastrocrom, singulaire, zyrtec, and reserve epinephrine for angioedema/anaphylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

She was initially treated with Benadryl, Solumedrol, Pepcid, and Tylenol in the Emergency Department and later admitted to the medicine service. Due to worsening symptoms, she was consulted from allergy and started on ASA desensitization, but her symptoms worsened again. She was then given Solumedrol, Phenergan, and Ativan in the ICU. The patient's allergies include aspirin, iodine, NSAIDs, and opioid analgesics. She received ongoing infusions of Solumedrol, Benadryl, hydroxyzine, Singulair, Pepcid, and Phenergan overnight. 

The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/76 mmHg to 154/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia and received a total of 753 mL of intravenous fluids over 24 hours. 

During the physical examination, the patient appeared well-nourished but pale. Her eyes were within normal limits, and her cardiovascular examination revealed normal first and second heart sounds with peripheral pulse present."

The patient is a 28-year-old female with systemic mastocytosis. She has been experiencing symptoms consistent with past mastocytosis flares, which are likely related to her aspirin challenge. The patient is currently on multiple antihistamines and antiemetics.

3. Coffee ground emesis: The patient has mild coffee ground emesis and slightly guaiac positive stools. This could be due to known gastritis and potential gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring hematocrit, continuing H2 blocker, and considering an endoscopic evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract may be necessary.

","The patient is a 28-year-old female with systemic mastocytosis and symptoms consistent with past flares. She has been experiencing recurrent flushing, which she attributes to an aspirin challenge. She is currently on multiple antihistamines and antiemetics, but refused to take low-dose aspirin due to continued flushing. The patient is tolerating oral intake. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 124/73 to 153/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin, NSAIDs, opioids, and iodine. She also has a history of nausea/vomiting, which may be related to gastritis. 

Her physical examination shows clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no skin abnormalities. 

Laboratory results and imaging are not provided in the note. 

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of systemic mastocytosis, tachycardia, fluid status, coffee ground emesis, abdominal pain/reflux, anxiety, electrolyte imbalance, access, prophylaxis, and code status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with systemic mastocytosis. She has been experiencing recurrent flushing and is currently on antihistamines and antiemetics. The patient was recommended to take low-dose aspirin, but she refused due to continued flushing. Her vital signs are stable, and she is tolerating oral intake. However, she has a history of allergies to aspirin, NSAIDs, opioids, and iodine. The patient also has symptoms consistent with past mastocytosis flares, likely related to her aspirin challenge. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Anaphylaxis: Given the patient's known allergies to aspirin, NSAIDs, opioids, and iodine, there is a risk of anaphylactic reaction if exposed to any of these allergens.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has mild coffee ground emesis and slightly guaiac positive stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be due to her known gastritis and potential tear from vomiting.
3. Fluid status imbalance: The patient may be relatively volume down from vasodilation, which could contribute to her tachycardia. Close monitoring of fluid balance is necessary.
4. Infection risk: The patient is in the ICU, where there is an increased risk of acquiring hospital-acquired infections. Proper infection control measures should be followed.
5. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with systemic mastocytosis currently admitted to the ICU. She is experiencing a flare of mastocytosis symptoms, including nausea and vomiting. Her vital signs are generally stable, with a heart rate within normal range and blood pressure within acceptable limits. However, she has been experiencing some flushing episodes despite being tapered off Soluble. Her peripheral pulses are absent on the right side and present on the left side. Neurological assessment has not been conducted yet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mastocytosis flare: The patient's current symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and flushing are attributed to a mastocytosis flare. She has been prescribed prednisone, antihistamines (Singular/H2B), and will follow up with an allergy specialist regarding aspirin allergy recommendations.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate was initially elevated, but it resolved with treatment for the mastocytosis. Another peripheral intravenous line should be placed, and the standing intravenous fluid should be discontinued.
3. Esophagitis: The patient is experiencing vomiting, which is likely related to her mastocytosis. She will continue with H2B and magic mouthwash, as well as antiemetics.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 4,219 mL and total output of 1,350 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with systemic mastocytosis experiencing a typical flare-up consisting of flushing, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain. She has been receiving desensitization treatment for aspirin (ASA) on the floor but seemed to worsen after receiving a 325 mg dose of ASA. The patient has allergies to ASA, iodine, NSAIDs, and opioid analgesics. She is currently being treated with solumedrol, H2B, benadryl, hydroxyzine, and singulair. Her vital signs are stable, with a slight elevation in heart rate. She has been receiving IV fluids and has had a total fluid intake of 4,219 mL and output of 1,350 mL. She is not receiving respiratory support. Her physical examination reveals normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings but absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Neurologic assessment is not complete due to patient refusal. Laboratory results show normal WBC count, Hct, and Plt levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mastocytosis flare: The patient's systemic mastocytosis is causing a flare-up, characterized by flushing, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain. Treatment adjustments may be necessary to manage these symptoms.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated. With proper management of the mastocytosis flare, this condition may resolve.

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with systemic mastocytosis experiencing a flare-up, characterized by flushing, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain. She has been receiving treatment in the ICU, including Solu-Medrol, H2 blockers, Benadryl, hydroxyzine, and Singulair. The patient's allergies include aspirin, nausea/vomiting, iodine, NSAIDs (which exacerbate her mastocytosis), and opioid analgesics (also causing nausea/vomiting). Her vital signs are generally stable, with some fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. She has received fluid infusions and is being closely monitored for any complications. The patient's condition remains under observation, and adjustments to her medication regimen are being made based on her symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anaphylaxis: Given the patient's known allergies, particularly to aspirin and NSAIDs, there is a risk of anaphylactic reaction if exposed to these allergens.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of systemic mastocytosis and current symptoms of flushing and abdominal pain may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Renal impairment: Aggressive fluid resuscitation and the use of diuretics could potentially lead to renal impairment if not closely monitored.
4. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and the use of invasive lines and devices increase the risk of developing healthcare-associated infections.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with systemic mastocytosis. She experienced symptoms consistent with past mastocytosis flares, which were likely triggered by an aspirin challenge. The patient is currently tolerating oral intake and is being treated with multiple antihistamines and antiemetics. Due to continued flushing and patient reluctance, low-dose aspirin was not given. Instead, steroids were increased to solumedrol 80 TID, and the patient remained in the ICU for close monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anaphylaxis: The patient's history of systemic mastocytosis and symptoms typical of past flares indicate a risk for anaphylactic reactions. Close monitoring and availability of epinephrine for angioedema/anaphylaxis are necessary.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of mild coffee ground emesis and slightly guaiac positive stool suggests the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring hematocrit levels, continuing H2 blocker therapy, and considering an outpatient esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) may be required.
3. Fluid status: The patient could be relatively volume depleted from vasodilation, which might contribute to tachycardia. Ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation is important.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated, which could be due to an underlying mastocytosis flare. Treatment"

","Summary:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with systemic mastocytosis who presented with symptoms consistent with past flares. She has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and has a known history of gastritis. The patient has been on multiple antihistamines and antiemetics, and was recommended to take low-dose aspirin yesterday due to her tolerance of lower doses and high prostaglandin levels. However, the low-dose aspirin was not given because of continued flushing and patient reluctance. The patient is currently tolerating oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anaphylaxis: Due to the patient's known allergies and previous reactions to certain medications such as aspirin, there is a risk of anaphylactic reaction if exposed to allergens.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing coffee ground emesis and mild gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be a result of her known gastritis or potential tear from vomiting. Continuous monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as ongoing assessment for signs of bleeding, is essential.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid status could be relatively volume depleted from vasodilation, which may contribute to tachycardia. It is important to closely monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust accordingly.
4. Infection: As the patient is in the ICU, there is an increased risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 28-year-old female with systemic mastocytosis experiencing a typical flare-up consisting of flushing, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and palpitations. The patient has a known allergy to aspirin and has been receiving desensitization treatment on the floor. However, she worsened after receiving a 325 mg dose of ASA. The patient is currently on a regimen of solumedrol, H2 blockers, benadryl, hydroxyzine, and singulair. She was admitted to the ICU due to another episode of flushing and remained there for further management. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, blood pressure of 153/81 mmHg, heart rate of 56 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the ongoing symptoms related to her systemic mastocytosis flare. 

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, normal cardiovascular examination, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both extremities. Neurologic examination was not assessed. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. 

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of systemic mastocytosis flare with continued use of solumedrol, H2 blockers,"
