   hemorrhage as a result of ischemia.  A contrast CT was not able to be
   done considering lack of IV access acutely.  Will consider MRI/MRA
   head/neck when the patient is more stable.  Repeat Non-contrast head CT
   did not show any interval change of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
   Neurology Stroke team is on board.
   - Pt received dilantin load of 20 mg/kg, ie 1600mg X1 yesterday,
   followed by Dilantin 100mg TID this AM for presumed seizure activity as
   the cause of his symptoms
   - Dilantin level pending
   - Will start continuous EEG monitoring today
   - Will continue home dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Will treat hyperglycemia with ISS
   - required intubation for airway protection
   - Neurology Stroke Consult Service on board
   - will place on seizure precautions
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 60**] have been secondary to stroke, however patient
   also is febrile.  As the patient has been inpatient for some time, he
   is at risk for hospital acquired infections.
   - Will send blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - CXR does not show evidence of consolidation
   - Start empiric antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia, with
   clindamycin
   .
   #  Hemo/Pneumothorax:  Iatrogenic from subclavian line placement.
   Chest tube in place putting out 300cc of serosanginous fluid, with
   intermittent air leak.  Will check with surgery regarding placement.
   Will get ABG/VBG correlation and adjust ventilatory settings based on
   those, the patient may require decreased tidal volumes and increased
   Fi02.

   # ETOH withdrawal:  Will monitor of CIWA protocol q1h with IV
   diazepam.  Will use ativan 2mg q1H PRN given patient unable to express
   symptoms.

   # Hypertension:  Blood pressures were elevated on admission, up to
   160
s prior to CVA, had episodes of hypotension following
   hemo-pneumothorax and propofol bolus.  Responded to short run of
   norepinephrine, currently on fluids to maintain adequate blood
   pressures.  Per Neurology, will attempt to maintain BP less than 160
   systolic with IV hydralazine if needed.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient had history of emphysema on CT Chest in [**5-18**].
   Likely from heavy smoking history.  Patient may have aspirated in his
   ictal state.   Will monitor respiratory status closely.  Patient
   intubated given acute agitation and need for central access.   Will
   wean ventilator settings as patient

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism. He was admitted to the MICU after being found seizing on his porch and treated for alcohol withdrawal. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's current conditions and potential complications include:

1. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of hemorrhage by non-contrast head CT, which could be primary or secondary hemorrhage as a result of ischemia. A contrast CT was not able to be done due to lack of IV access acutely. An MRI/MRA head/neck will be considered when the patient is more stable.

2. Hemo/Pneumothorax: The patient developed a hemothorax due to an iatrogenic complication from subclavian line placement. A chest tube has been placed, draining 300cc of serosanguinous fluid with intermittent air leak. The placement of the chest tube needs to be confirmed by surgery.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires invasive ventilation support due to acute respiratory failure. The ventilator settings may need adjustment based on the ABG/VBG correlation, considering the possibility of decreased tidal volumes and increased FiO2.

4. Renal Failure, Acute: The patient has elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating acute renal failure. Further evaluation and management of renal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism. He was admitted to the MICU after being found seizing on his porch and treated for alcohol withdrawal. However, upon transfer to the floor, he was found to be somnolent and diagnosed with an intracerebral hemorrhage.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hemothorax, CVA (stroke), respiratory failure, acute renal failure, abdominal compartment syndrome/intra-abdominal hypertension, and alcohol withdrawal. The assessment and plan include various interventions such as treating hyperglycemia, continuous EEG monitoring, starting empiric antibiotics if fever persists, monitoring for CIWA protocol for ETOH withdrawal, maintaining blood pressure below 160 systolic with IV hydralazine, closely monitoring respiratory status, repleting electrolytes as needed, and initiating IV fluids.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections due to prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures.
2. Stroke progression: The intracerebral hemorrhage needs close monitoring, and further imaging may be required to determine the cause and extent of the bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the MICU after being found unresponsive on the floor. He has a left parietal CVA with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and required invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient experienced complications such as hemo-pneumothorax, which required chest tube placement, and hypotension that necessitated the use of pressors. His mental status remained altered, necessitating the administration of lorazepam and propofol. The patient also has allergies to penicillins, aspirin, and unknown medications that cause rashes. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102.1°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/62 mmHg to 157/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 48 mL and output of 30 mL, resulting in a balance of 18 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. Other lab values include elevated potassium and magnesium levels. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current conditions include hypotension, hemothorax, cerebral vascular accident (stroke), acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, abdominal compartment syndrome/intra-abdominal hypertension, seizure, alcohol withdrawal, and delirium tremens. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of nosocomial infections such as VAP or catheter-related bloodstream infections, and potential complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism who was admitted to the MICU after being found seizing on his porch. He was treated for alcohol withdrawal in the hospital and later found to have an intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, hemothorax, CVA (stroke), respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and abdominal compartment syndrome/IAH (intra-abdominal hypertension). The patient is also experiencing alcohol withdrawal and has a history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and heavy smoking. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of hemorrhage in the brain, which could be primary or secondary to ischemia. This condition requires close monitoring and further imaging studies, such as MRI/MRA, when the patient is more stable.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's high white blood cell count may be due to the stroke, but it could also indicate a hospital-acquired infection. Cultures should be obtained, and empiric antibiotics may be considered after cultures are drawn.
3. Hemo/Pneumothorax: The patient has an iatrogenic hemothorax from subclavian line placement. A chest tube is in place, and the patient may require additional interventions to manage the fluid and air leak.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute stroke and a history of ethanol withdrawal and seizure. The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, hemothorax, respiratory failure, renal failure, and abdominal compartment syndrome/intra-abdominal hypertension. There is also a concern for alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens and seizures.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.6 F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/80 to 157/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with mechanical ventilation.

The physical examination reveals a disheveled general appearance, poor dentition, clear breath sounds, somnolent mental status with severe nystagmus and right neglect, and ecchymoses on the skin. Neurological examination shows severe nystagmus and right neglect.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities. Imaging studies show a repeat non-contrast head CT without interval change, significant left parietal bleed.

The assessment and plan include hypotension, hemothorax, CVA (stroke), respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and other medical issues. The patient is on various"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of acute stroke. They have been intubated and sedated overnight. The patient's vital signs show fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. They have a history of hypotension, hemorrhagic stroke, respiratory failure, renal failure, abdominal compartment syndrome, seizure, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and creatinine level. The patient has multiple medical complications and is currently receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a potential infection. This could be due to a hospital-acquired infection or an underlying condition contributing to the fever.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension may indicate poor blood flow and perfusion to vital organs. This could be a result of sepsis, hemorrhagic stroke, or other underlying conditions affecting cardiac function.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on mechanical ventilation suggest acute respiratory failure. This could be caused by pneumonia, aspiration, or exacerbation of underlying respiratory conditions.
4. Renal failure: The elevated creatinine level indicates impaired kidney function. Acute kidney injury or renal failure could be caused by decreased blood flow, toxins, or underlying medical conditions.
5. Stroke complications: The patient's hemorrh"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU due to an acute stroke. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to various factors such as sepsis or inadequate fluid resuscitation.

2. Hemothorax: The patient has a chest tube inserted for a suspected hemothorax, which is the accumulation of blood in the pleural cavity. This can be caused by trauma or other underlying conditions.

3. CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction), hemorrhagic: The patient has experienced a hemorrhagic stroke, which is characterized by bleeding within the brain. This can result in neurological deficits and increased intracranial pressure.

4. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is intubated for airway protection and requires mechanical ventilation. This suggests acute respiratory failure, possibly due to the stroke or another underlying cause.

5. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. This can be caused by several factors, including hypotension leading to decreased renal perfusion.

6. History of abdominal compartment syndrome/intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH, ACS): The patient has a history of abdominal compartment syndrome or intra-abdominal hypertension, which refers to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with hypotension, respiratory failure, renal failure, cerebral infarction, and a possible seizure event. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's physical examination reveals macroglossia with whitish plaques, left gaze preference with nystagmus, and decreased motor function in the right leg. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function. The patient has multiple lines and tubes inserted, including a midline catheter, and is receiving various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and the presence of whitish plaques on the tongue could indicate an infection, which may lead to sepsis.
2. Stroke: The left gaze preference with nystagmus and decreased motor function in the right leg suggest a possible stroke or cerebral infarction.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure could progress to ARDS, especially if there is an underlying infection or other contributing factors.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The abnormal kidney function indicated by elevated creatinine and urea levels could be due to the patient's acute renal failure.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility"

He was treated for alcohol withdrawal and later found to be somnolent with an intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient remains sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of hemorrhage by non-contrast head CT, suggesting ischemic conversion. This condition requires close monitoring and further management.
2. Pulmonary: The patient likely has pneumonia causing fevers, and he is on clindamycin for aspiration. There is also a persistent pneumothorax from subclavian placement, with a chest tube in place. The chest tube needs evaluation by thoracics today.
3. ETOH withdrawal: The patient may be experiencing alcohol withdrawal, and propofol has been used as an effective treatment. Sedation will be reassessed after stopping propofol.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures were elevated on admission, and he had episodes of hypotension following hemo-pneumothorax and propofol bolus. He responded to a short run of norepinephrine and is currently on fluids to maintain adequate blood pressures.
5. FEN (Fluid, Electrolyte, and Nutrition): The patient will need some form of nutrition,"

   and found to be somnolent today, found to have intracerebral
   hemorrhage.
   .
   #. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage:  Evidence of hemorrhage by non-contrast
   head CT, could be primary (AVM, amyloid angiopathy) or secondary
   hemorrhage as a result of ischemia.  A contrast CT was not able to be
   done considering lack of IV access acutely.  Will consider MRI/MRA
   head/neck when the patient is more stable.  Repeat Non-contrast head CT
   did not show any interval change of the intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
   Neurology Stroke team is on board.
   - Pt received dilantin load of 20 mg/kg, ie 1600mg X1 yesterday,
   followed by Dilantin 100mg TID this AM for presumed seizure activity as
   the cause of his symptoms
   - Dilantin level pending
   - Will start continuous EEG monitoring today
   - Will continue home dose of Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Will treat hyperglycemia with ISS
   - required intubation for airway protection
   - Neurology Stroke Consult Service on board
   - will place on seizure precautions
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 60**] have been secondary to stroke, however patient
   also is febrile.  As the patient has been inpatient for some time, he
   is at risk for hospital acquired infections.
   - Will send blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - CXR does not show evidence of consolidation
   - Start empiric antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia, with
   clindamycin
   .
   #  Hemo/Pneumothorax:  Iatrogenic from subclavian line placement.
   Chest tube in place putting out 300cc of serosanginous fluid, with
   intermittent air leak.  Will check with surgery regarding placement.
   Will get ABG/VBG correlation and adjust ventilatory settings based on
   those, the patient may require decreased tidal volumes and increased
   Fi02.
   .
   # ETOH withdrawal:  Will monitor of CIWA protocol q1h with IV
   diazepam.  Will use ativan 2mg q1H PRN given patient unable to express
   symptoms.
   .
   # Hypertension:  Blood pressures were elevated on admission, up to
   160
s prior to CVA, had episodes of hypotension following
   hemo-pneumothorax and propofol bolus.  Responded to short run of
   norepinephrine, currently on fluids to maintain adequate blood
   pressures.  Per Neurology, will attempt to maintain BP less than 160
   systolic with IV hydralazine if needed.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient had history of emphysema on CT Chest in [**5-18**].
   Likely from heavy smoking history.  Patient may have aspirated in his
   ictal state.   Will monitor respiratory status closely.  Patient
   intubated given acute agitation and need for central access.   Will
   wean ventilator settings as patient
s mental status tolerates.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism. He was admitted to the MICU after being found seizing on his porch and treated for alcohol withdrawal. The patient was then transferred to the floor but found to be somnolent today. He has intracerebral hemorrhage confirmed by non-contrast head CT. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of hemorrhage in the brain, which can be primary or secondary to ischemia. Further imaging studies, such as MRI/MRA head/neck, may be needed when the patient is more stable.

2. Leukocytosis and Hospital-Acquired Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be secondary to stroke, but he is also febrile. As he has been an inpatient for some time, he is at risk for hospital-acquired infections. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures will be sent, and empiric antibiotics have been started for possible aspiration pneumonia.

3. Hemo/Pneumothorax: The patient developed a hemo/pneumothorax iatrogenically from subclavian line placement. A chest tube has been placed, and the patient is producing serosanginous fluid with intermittent air leaks. The placement of the line needs to be checked with surgery.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male initially admitted with alcohol withdrawal and seizures. He has now developed acute respiratory failure and is intubated for airway protection. The patient also has a recent stroke (cerebral infarction) and hemorrhagic CVAs, as well as acute renal failure. There is a history of abdominal compartment syndrome/intraabdominal hypertension, and the patient experienced a seizure without status epilepticus.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and will be switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) as tolerated.
2. Hemopneumothorax: A chest tube is placed on suction, and a repeat chest X-ray will be done in the afternoon. Trauma surgery will follow.
3. Fevers: The differential diagnosis includes intracranial hemorrhage versus aspiration pneumonia. Clindamycin has been started, and pan culture has been obtained.
4. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is on propofol and ativan as needed.
5. Access: An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed.
6. Remaining issues will be addressed according to the housestaff notes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function needs close monitoring due to intubation and potential complications associated with mechanical ventilation.
2. Hemopneumothorax: The presence of a chest tube and ongoing air leak indicates a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of stroke and respiratory failure. He has a history of alcohol withdrawal and seizure. The patient is intubated for airway protection and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypotension, hemothorax, cerebral infarction (stroke), acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, abdominal compartment syndrome/intraabdominal hypertension, and alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Complications that may arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, and barotrauma.
2. Hemothorax: The patient requires a chest tube insertion to manage hemothorax. Complications that may arise include pneumothorax, infection, and bleeding.
3. Stroke: The patient has experienced a stroke, which can lead to various complications such as increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, seizures, and neurological deficits.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, putting him at risk for complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremic toxins.
5. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome/Intraabdominal Hypertension: This condition increases the risk of complications like organ dysfunction, impaired circulation, and abdominal wall herniation.
6. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is at"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was initially admitted for alcohol withdrawal and seizure. He is now in the ICU due to an acute cerebrovascular accident (stroke), respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hemopneumothorax, and suspected intra-abdominal hypertension. The patient has a history of ethanol withdrawal, seizure, and potential aspiration pneumonia. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, blood pressure of 142/63 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated for airway protection and on mechanical ventilation. He has a chest tube to suction for the hemothorax, and a midline catheter for access.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications with mechanical ventilation or if the underlying cause of respiratory failure is not addressed.
2. Hemopneumothorax: The air leak in the chest tube suggests ongoing pleural injury, which can lead to persistent pneumothorax or recurrent hemothorax. Close monitoring and further intervention may be required.
3. Fevers: The patient's fever could be indicative of an infection, such as aspiration pneumonia or a catheter-related bloodstream infection. Cultures have been obtained, but further investigation and appropriate antibiotic treatment may be necessary.
4. Ethanol Withdrawal:"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism who presented to the MICU after being found seizing on his porch. He was treated for alcohol withdrawal in the hospital, transferred to the floor, and found to be somnolent with evidence of an intracerebral hemorrhage. 

The patient has several ongoing medical complications, including hypotension (not in shock), hemothorax, CVA (stroke or cerebral infarction), respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS), renal failure (acute), abdominal compartment syndrome/ intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH, ACS), seizure activity without status epilepticus, and alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures).

The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and sedated with propofol. He is on multiple medications, including clindamycin for aspiration coverage, vancomycin for possible staph infection, dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and hydralazine to control blood pressure. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 140/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple medical conditions, including hypotension, hemothorax, CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction), respiratory failure, acute renal failure, abdominal compartment syndrome/intraabdominal hypertension (ACS/IAH), seizure, alcohol withdrawal, and others. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, increased blood pressure, and respiratory distress. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and low platelet count. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, IV fluids, and multiple medications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and tachycardia may indicate an infection. Sepsis is a potential complication in this case.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and low oxygen saturation levels suggest a risk for ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can occur as a complication of sepsis or other inflammatory responses.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. Acute renal failure can occur due to hypotension, sepsis, or other underlying conditions.
4. Delirium or Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and history of seizures may suggest the possibility of delirium or seizures as potential complications.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, stroke, and pneumothorax. The patient has experienced recurrent pneumothorax requiring a second chest tube insertion, self-extubation followed by successful reintubation, and fever. Allergies are reported to penicillins, aspirin, and an unknown rash. The patient is currently on various medications including propofol, dilantin, and clindamycin.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate between 71-95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/65 to 189/100 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates fluid balance with a total input of 2,841 mL and output of 1,095 mL. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count between 12.8-17.8 K/uL, hemoglobin levels between 27.4-41.6 g/dL, platelet count between 238-303 K/uL, creatinine levels between 0.8-1.8 mg/dL, glucose levels between 90-140 mg/dL, and other abnormal lab values including elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low calcium (Ca++), magnesium ("

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The ABG results show a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis.

2. Stroke: The patient has been diagnosed with a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), specifically a hemorrhagic stroke. This is evident from the neurological examination findings and the head CT report.

3. Pneumothorax: The patient has experienced recurrent pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement. The chest X-ray confirms the presence of a chest tube in place.

4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive despite being on vasopressors. The blood pressure readings show low systolic and diastolic pressures.

5. Hemothorax: The patient has a hemothorax, likely secondary to the recurrent pneumothorax and chest tube insertion.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function tests indicate an elevated serum creatinine level and decreased urine output. This suggests acute kidney injury.

7. Abdominal compartment syndrome/intra-abdominal hypertension: The patient has a history of abdominal compartment syndrome or intra-abdominal hypertension.

8. Seizure: The patient has had seizures, although the status epilepticus is denied.

9. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, stroke, and pneumothorax. The patient has a history of ethanol withdrawal and seizures, and he currently has acute cerebral infarction with hemorrhagic conversion.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to his recent stroke but now faces respiratory complications, including pneumothorax with persistent air leak and likely aspiration pneumonia.

2. Hemo-pneumothorax: The patient has a persistent air leak despite having two chest tubes inserted. The cause may be a bronchopleural fistula, possibly resulting from trauma.

3. Fevers: The patient has been running a fever of 101.2°F, raising suspicion for either infective endocarditis or aspiration pneumonia. Vancomycin has been added to the antibiotic regimen.

4. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient is being treated with propofol and ativan for ethanol withdrawal symptoms.

5. Access: An IR-guided midline access has been established for central venous access.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to persistent air leak and potential bronchopleural fistula. The patient is at risk for further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged intubation. There is also a"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several significant medical conditions. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, stroke (cerebral infarction), and pneumothorax. The patient has experienced recurrent pneumothorax requiring a second chest tube insertion. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate between 71-95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 130/65 to 189/100 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The physical examination reveals coarse bilateral crepitus in the chest, distended abdomen, and 1+ tibial edema. Neurological examination shows the patient opens their eyes to voice, squeezes hand on command, but does not move the right side or squeeze right hand.

The laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hb), high creatinine (Cr), low sodium (Na+), high potassium (K+), and elevated lactate levels. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows respiratory acidosis.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, hemothorax, stroke (hemorrhagic), respiratory failure, acute renal failure, abdominal compartment syndrome/intraabdominal hypertension, seizure, alcohol withdrawal, and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism, who was found seizing on his porch. He was admitted to the MICU and treated for alcohol withdrawal. He then experienced a change in mental status and was found to have an intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient required intubation for airway protection and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of hemorrhage in the brain, which may lead to further neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure or brain herniation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure due to hemo-pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement and possible aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia. This can lead to worsening hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and low urine output. This can progress to acute renal failure if not managed appropriately.
4. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and lead to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.
5. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcoholism and is at risk for withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures were"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism, admitted to the MICU after being found seizing on his porch. He was treated for alcohol withdrawal and subsequently transferred to the floor, where he was found to be somnolent with an intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient's current condition includes intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, potential ethanol withdrawal, hypertension, and acute renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has positive cultures from the sputum growing gram-positive cocci in clusters and chains as well as gram-positive rods, indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. This could lead to further respiratory complications and systemic infection.

2. Seizure activity: The patient's dilantin level is low at 3.2, indicating a need for redosing. If seizure activity recurs, it can result in additional neurological damage and increased risk of complications.

3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension following hemo-pneumothorax and propofol bolus. Persistent hypotension may compromise organ perfusion and contribute to renal failure or other systemic complications.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to the hemo-pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement and the possibility of aspiration or pneumonia. Continued respiratory support may be necessary, and we"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism who was found seizing on his porch. He was treated for alcohol withdrawal and later found to be somnolent with an intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient is currently intubated and sedated with propofol. He has evidence of a hemo-pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement, positive cultures indicating hospital-acquired pneumonia, and multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and possible stroke. The patient's condition is unstable with hypotension and requires close monitoring in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of hemorrhage by non-contrast head CT suggesting ischemic conversion. Further imaging and continuous EEG monitoring are needed to assess the extent and severity of the hemorrhage.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure due to hemo-pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement, likely aspiration, or hospital-acquired pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and supportive care with mechanical ventilation are necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is required. Diuretics or dialysis may be needed to manage fluid overload and correct electrolyte imbalances.

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism. He was admitted to the MICU after being found seizing on his porch. He was treated for alcohol withdrawal in the hospital but later found to be somnolent with an intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of hemorrhage on a non-contrast head CT, suggesting ischemic conversion. This may lead to further neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, brain herniation, and potential seizures.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure due to hemo-pneumothorax requiring a second chest tube placement, as well as likely aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia. This can result in worsening hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and potentially sepsis.

3. Ethanol Withdrawal: Although the patient's ethanol withdrawal has been resolved at this time, there is still a risk for potential withdrawal symptoms upon cessation of sedation. Symptoms may include tremors, agitation, seizures, and delirium tremens.

4. Hypertension: The patient had elevated blood pressures prior to the cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and experienced episodes of hypotension following hemo-pneumothorax and propofol bolus. It is important to manage blood pressure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism. He was admitted to the MICU after being found seizing on his porch. The patient was treated for alcohol withdrawal and later transferred to the floor, where he was found to be somnolent with an intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient's current condition includes an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, alcohol withdrawal, hypertension, and feeding intolerance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of hemorrhage in the brain, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deficits if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, including hemo-pneumothorax, aspiration, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. This can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis if not treated appropriately.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is at risk for complications related to alcohol withdrawal, such as seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability.
4. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressures may contribute to further end-organ damage and increase the risk of complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney injury.
5. Feeding Intolerance: The patient has feeding intolerance, which may lead to malnutrition and dehydration if not addressed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism who was admitted to the MICU after being found seizing on his porch. He was treated for alcohol withdrawal but developed somnolence and an intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient's condition has deteriorated, leading to respiratory failure due to a hemo-pneumothorax, aspiration, or hospital-acquired pneumonia. He self-extubated but tolerated a shovel mask well. The prognosis is poor, and the decision has been made to make the patient DNR/DNI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of hemorrhage by non-contrast head CT, which suggests ischemic conversion. There is a biparietal hemorrhagic infarction seen on MRI/MRA of the brain.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, including hemo-pneumothorax requiring a second chest tube placement, likely aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia with positive cultures from the sputum.
3. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient had resolved ethanol withdrawal but may require the use of ativan for acute agitation and antipsychotics if ativan is not helpful.
4. Hypertension: The patient had elevated blood pressures prior to the cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and responded to norepinephrine during episodes"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history and current condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has experienced unplanned extubation. There is a risk of respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.

2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently high, indicating possible hypertension. This could lead to complications such as heart failure or end-organ damage.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has elevated serum creatinine levels and reduced urine output, suggesting potential acute kidney injury or renal failure. This can be caused by factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs.

4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the presence of a central line increases the risk of bloodstream infections.

5. Thromboembolic Events: Immobility and the presence of central lines increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

6. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on antiepileptic medications. There is a risk of further neurological complications, including status epilepticus or recurrent seizures.

7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient may be at risk of stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding due to critical illness and prolonged"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism. He was admitted to the MICU after being found seizing on his porch and treated for alcohol withdrawal. The patient then experienced a decline in mental status and was found to have an intracerebral hemorrhage.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, which is multifactorial. This includes hemo-pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement, likely aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia.

2. ETOH withdrawal: Although the patient's ETOH withdrawal has resolved at this time, there is a risk for its recurrence, especially if sedation is stopped.

3. Hypertension: The patient had elevated blood pressures prior to the cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and experienced episodes of hypotension following hemo-pneumothorax and propofol bolus. The target BP is less than 160 mmHg to prevent further CVAs.

4. FEN (feeding): The patient requires continued IV fluids, repletion of electrolytes as needed, tube feeds, and a bowel regimen.

5. Prophylaxis: The patient is on pneumoboots for prophylaxis against pneumonia and seizure precautions.

6. Access: The patient has peripheral IV lines in the foot, right arm, and left leg, as"

   and found to be somnolent with intracerebral hemorrhage.
   #. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage:  Evidence of hemorrhage by non-contrast
   head CT suggests ischemic conversion,
   - Switch Dilantin to Fosphenytoin yesterday for line ease, in addition
   to Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - MRI/MRA w/ and w/out contrast of brain showed biparietal hemorrhagic
   infarction
   - Cont. ISS for hyperglycemia
   - Neurology Stroke Consult Service following
   - will continue seizure precautions
   - Likely hemorrhage due to venous congestion, continue Heparin gtt
   #.  Respiratory Failure:  Multifactorial, hemo-pneumothorax requiring
   second chest tube placement as well as likely aspiration or hospital
   acquired pneumonia given positive cultures from the sputum growing gram
   positive cocci in clusters and chains as well as gram positive rods.
   Pt self extubated overnight, tolerating shovel mask well.  Plan not to
   reintubate given prognosis of intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
   - Continue clindamycin and vancomycin, will get ID approval today
   - Continue shovel mask and O2 supplementation as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of untreated hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism. He was admitted to the MICU after being found seizing on his porch. The patient was treated for alcohol withdrawal and subsequently transferred to the floor, where he was found to be somnolent with an intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient's current conditions include an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, respiratory failure, ETOH withdrawal, hypertension, and potential feeding tube-associated enterocolitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient has evidence of hemorrhage on a non-contrast head CT, suggesting ischemic conversion. This condition can worsen and lead to increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, or even death if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure, including hemo-pneumothorax requiring a second chest tube placement and likely aspiration or hospital-acquired pneumonia. This can lead to further deterioration of respiratory function and potential sepsis if not managed promptly.
3. ETOH Withdrawal: Although the patient's withdrawal symptoms have resolved for now, there is still a risk of recurrence if the patient does not receive appropriate management. This can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium, and cardiovascular instability.
4. Hypertension: The patient had elevated blood pressures prior to the cerebro"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of Htn, Emphysema and alcoholism admitted
   initially for withdrawal seizures to later develop intracerebral
   hemorrhage from embolic stroke.  His respiratory and mental status
   continue to improve, but he is still confused, easily agitated and
   lacks a solution for nutrition at this time.
   #. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage:  No indication of progressing disease.
   - Fosphenytoin, Keppra 1g [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - Neurology Stroke Consult Service following
   - will continue seizure precautions
   - Lovenox 80mg SC BID started for anticoagulation
   #.  Respiratory Failure:  Patient tolerating nasal cannula.  Aspiration
   pneumonia improving on Clindamycin & vancomycin.  Hemopneumothorax
   secondary to line placement continues with chest tube draining ~100ccs
   today.
   -          Clindamycin 600mg IV Q8h & Vancomycin 1g Q12 8 day total
   course (until [**2181-1-21**])
   -          Continue NC and supplement with shovel mask as needed
   # ETOH withdrawal:  Resolved at this time. Will use ativan for acute
   agitation, will use antipsychotics if ativan is not helpful..
   # Hypertension:  Blood pressures were elevated on admission, up to
   160
s prior to CVA, had episodes of hypotension following
   hemo-pneumothorax and propofol bolus.  Responded to short run of
   norepinephrine, currently on fluids to maintain adequate blood
   pressures.
   -Target BP <160 per CVA, currently normotensive
   # FEN:  Continue IVF, replete electrolytes as needed.  Will attempt
   Doboff placement again today to restart tube feeds
   # Prophylaxis:  Lovenox, Seizure PPx
   # Access: Midline, peripheral IV only

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism. He was admitted initially for withdrawal seizures and later developed an intracerebral hemorrhage from an embolic stroke. His respiratory and mental status continue to improve, but he remains confused, easily agitated, and lacks a solution for nutrition at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: The patient has already experienced an intracerebral hemorrhage. There is no indication of progressing disease, but ongoing monitoring and management are necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had aspiration pneumonia, which is improving on Clindamycin and vancomycin. He also has a hemopneumothorax secondary to line placement, which continues with chest tube drainage. Ongoing respiratory support and careful monitoring are required.
3. ETOH withdrawal: The patient has resolved ETOH withdrawal at this time. However, the use of medications such as Ativan and antipsychotics may be needed for acute agitation.
4. Hypertension: The patient had elevated blood pressures prior to the CVA and episodes of hypotension following hemo-pneumothorax and propofol bolus. Blood pressures need to be closely monitored and managed to maintain adequate perfusion.
5. FEN (feeding): The patient requires nutritional support, and attempts will be made to restart tube feeds using a Dob"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a trauma patient in the ICU with multiple complications and ongoing medical management. The patient's chief complaint includes difficulty in placing a G-tube due to unsuccessful attempts, transition from heparin to enoxaparin (Lovenox), agitation requiring Haldol, Ativan, and Zyprexa at night, and the need for an IR peg due to GI's unavailability.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, aspirin, and an unknown rash. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin and Clindamycin. The patient is on various infusions including midazolam (Versed), enoxaparin (Lovenox), famotidine (Pepcid), fosphenytoin, lorazepam (Ativan), and haloperidol (Haldol).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 170/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an intake of 1,107 mL and output of 2,375 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1,268 mL. The patient's blood products show an output of 425 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension, emphysema, and alcoholism. He was initially admitted for withdrawal seizures and later developed an intracerebral hemorrhage from an embolic stroke. His respiratory and mental status have improved, but he remains confused, easily agitated, and lacks a solution for nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage: There are no indications of progressing disease at the moment. However, the patient may be at risk for further hemorrhagic events or complications related to the initial hemorrhage.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is tolerating a nasal cannula and is showing improvement in aspiration pneumonia with antibiotic treatment. However, there is a concern regarding the hemopneumothorax secondary to line placement, which requires ongoing management, including chest tube drainage and potential removal.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be monitored and managed to maintain target levels below 160 to prevent any further complications related to his cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
4. Feeding Tube (FEN): The placement of a Doboff tube was unsuccessful, leading to the placement of a nasogastric (NG) tube. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is scheduled for Monday. The confirmation of chest x-ray is still pending.
5. Prophylaxis: The patient requires ongoing prophylaxis for deep vein thromb"
