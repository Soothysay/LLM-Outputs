   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   - TTE today
   # Hypotension/shock: cardiogenic vs septic shock. wbc count elevated.
   no fever. ?h/o c diff +ve. no h/o fever or diarrhea. Lactate low. CXR
   consistent with pulm edema and/or PNA of LLL. Tried fluid boluses as
   thought cardiogenic shock may be preload dependent given RCA infarct
   but UOP did not increase and had to increase dopa so may consider this
   to be systolic failure and may need to diurese for better CO.
   - will attempt lasix drip to assist diuresis.
   - wean dopamine as tolerated
   - hold off on anti-HTNs
   - monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - Consider amio to keep in NSR for better forward flow with atrial
   kick.
   - Consider changing pacemaker settings to change to atrial pacing
   # ?C diff diarrhea: no symptoms. wbc count at osh was 15

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) for an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 

24-hour events include diffuse right-sided pulmonary vascular congestion and left lower lobe opacity/effusion/atelectasis seen on chest X-ray. The patient experienced atrial tachycardia, which was converted to normal sinus rhythm with direct current cardioversion (DCCV). She was given 5 mg of Lopressor to control the atrial tachycardia and continued on dopamine at 8 mcg/min without the ability to wean off. A fluid challenge was administered for hypotension and low urine output, resulting in continued decreased urine output. Lasix 40 mg IV was given this morning.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 92/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high-flow nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals ongoing fluid administration and significant urine output.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 20.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 28.9%, platelet count (Plt) at 173 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 2.0 mg/dL, troponin-T at 14.93 ng/mL, and elevated potassium levels (K+) at 5.1 mEq/L. Other lab values include normal glucose levels and elevated lactic acid levels.

Imaging shows enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion and extensive opacification at the left base, which could be due to atelectasis and pleural effusion or left lower lobe consolidation.

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of inferior STEMI, hypotension, potential Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hyperparathyroidism, and fluid/electrolyte management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, septic shock, C. diff diarrhea, and arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI. She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. On admission to the ICU, she demonstrated atrial tachycardia, hypotension, decreased urine output, and evidence of right-sided pulmonary vascular congestion with left lower lobe opacity/effusion/atelectasis on chest X-ray. She was started on heparin, dopamine, and metoprolol. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains hypotensive and continues to have decreased urine output. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, COPD, hyperparathyroidism, and fenofibrate use. Her current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, carvedilol, lisinopril, Combivent, Sensipar, and fenofibrate. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and decreased urine output may indicate cardiogenic shock due to acute decompensated heart failure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The decreased urine output raises concern for acute kidney injury, especially considering the patient's hypotension and potential cardiogenic shock.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The evidence of right-sided pulmonary vascular"

   but UOP did not increase and had to increase dopa so may consider this
   to be systolic failure and may need to diurese for better CO.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented to the hospital with an inferior STEMI. She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). Her cardiac enzymes peaked at 3000, and she was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. However, she developed hypotension and required increased doses of dopamine for hemodynamic support. Her white blood cell count is elevated, but there is no fever or evidence of Clostridium difficile infection. Chest X-ray shows pulmonary vascular congestion and opacification at the left base, which could be due to atelectasis, pleural effusion, or consolidation. The patient also has a dual-channel pacemaker device in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and low urine output suggest a possible cardiogenic shock secondary to her recent inferior STEMI. This is further supported by the findings of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and the need for aggressive fluid resuscitation and inotropic support.
2. Pneumonia: The opacification at the left base on chest X-ray raises the possibility of pneumonia. Close monitoring for clinical signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and worsening respiratory symptoms, is warranted.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's recent onset of atr"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). She now exhibits signs of hypotension and shock, possibly cardiogenic or septic, as evidenced by her elevated white blood cell count. Her vital signs show low blood pressure, decreased urine output, and low oxygen saturation. She also has bilateral pitting edema and wheezing on inspiration and expiration. The chest X-ray reveals pulmonary vascular congestion and extensive opacification at the left base, which could indicate atelectasis, pleural effusion, or left lower lobe consolidation. Her lab results show elevated cardiac enzymes, abnormal electrolyte levels, and low hemoglobin. The assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring, diuresis, weaning of dopamine, antiarrhythmic therapy, and consideration for amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm and improve forward flow. Potential medical complications include cardiogenic shock, septic shock, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). Currently, she is in the ICU due to hypotension and shock, likely cardiogenic or septic in nature. Her white blood cell count is elevated, but there is no fever. There is a possibility of Clostridium difficile infection, but no diarrhea or fever is present. Lactate levels are low, and chest X-ray shows pulmonary edema and/or possible pneumonia in the left lower lobe. The patient has been given fluid boluses, but her urine output did not increase, and she required an increase in dopamine dosage. This may suggest systolic failure, and diuresis may be necessary for better cardiac output. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed today to assess ejection fraction and wall motion abnormalities after the STEMI. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and she is currently in sinus rhythm. Other medical issues include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hyperparathyroidism, and familial hypertriglyceridemia."

   Imaging: TEE
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is
   seen in the body of the left or right atrium. No atrial septal defect
   is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%) with inferolateral hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets are moderately-to-severely
   thickened/deformed. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
   valve. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate
   (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. IABP seen in the
   descending aorta.
   IMPRESSION: Thickened mitral valve leaflets with moderate (+2) MR.
   Posterior mitral leaflet appeared teathered, likely secondary to
   ischemia. No mitral leaflet flail seen. Severely thickened aortic valve
   leaflets with moderate aortic stenosis. IABP seen in the descending
   aorta.
   TTE
   The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with moderate to severe hypokinesis of the basal to mid
   inferior and inferolateral segments. The other segments have
   hyperdynamic function. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is partial mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with inferior
   infarction/ischemia. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with poor
   leaflet apposition. This may be due to ischemic papillary muscle
   dysfunction or possible partial flail of the mitral leaflet. At least
   mild aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   #. MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a flail
   leaflet
   - Will attempt to get volume off with UF to decrease MR
   - Will continue IABP for better CO
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   #. Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   - TTE today
   # Hypotension/shock: cardiogenic vs septic shock. wbc count elevated.
   no fever. ?h/o c diff +ve. no h/o fever or diarrhea. Lactate low. CXR
   consistent with pulm edema and/or PNA of LLL. Tried fluid boluses as
   thought cardiogenic shock may be preload dependent given RCA infarct
   but UOP did not increase and had to increase dopa so may consider this
   to be systolic failure and may need to diurese for better CO.
   - Cte IABP until no longer necessary
   - hold off on anti-HTNs
   - Consider amio to keep in NSR for better forward flow with atrial
   kick.
   - Continue dopa
   - Stop lasix today
   # ARF: Likely seoncdary to two dye loads as well as poor CO
   - cls renal today for possibility of UF for volume overload
   - add urine eos for ?hypersensitivity reaction
   # ?C diff diarrhea: no symptoms.
   - d/c precautions today
   #. Afib: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension
   - continue IV heparin
   - BB for rate control
   # HTN: hold amlodipine, BB, ACE as pt hypotensive
   #. COPD: cont home combivent
   #. Hyperparathyroidism: cont sensipar

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. Post-PCI, the patient experienced hypotension and shock, which was initially thought to be cardiogenic due to the RCA infarct but later considered to be septic shock. The patient also has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) with ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction and moderate aortic stenosis. Other medical conditions include acute kidney injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyperparathyroidism, and Clostridium difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient initially presented with hypotension and shock, which was initially thought to be cardiogenic due to the RCA infarct. This condition can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs and can be life-threatening if not promptly managed.
2. Severe mitral regurgitation (MR): The patient has severe MR with ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction. This condition can result in volume overload, pulmonary edema, and heart failure.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is experiencing renal shutdown, which can lead to further deterioration of kidney function and potentially require renal replacement therapy.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of"

   The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with moderate to severe hypokinesis of the basal to mid
   inferior and inferolateral segments. The other segments have
   hyperdynamic function. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is partial mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with inferior
   infarction/ischemia. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with poor
   leaflet apposition. This may be due to ischemic papillary muscle
   dysfunction or possible partial flail of the mitral leaflet. At least
   mild aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a middle-aged female who presented with symptoms of a myocardial infarction. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation, likely caused by ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction. The patient also has severe aortic stenosis and low normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The patient underwent intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and is currently receiving supportive care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of myocardial infarction and low LVEF increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening if not promptly managed.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Severe mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis can lead to decreased cardiac output and potential cardiogenic shock, requiring close monitoring and hemodynamic support.
3. Prolonged ventilation: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate that she may require extended periods of ventilation. This increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other complications related to prolonged immobility.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged bed rest and immobilization in the ICU increase the risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). The patient has multiple medical complications and comorbidities, including hypotension, shock, congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hyperparathyroidism, and potential Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

From the summary of the note, the following potential medical complications can be identified:
1. Ischemic posterior papillary muscles leading to mitral regurgitation.
2. Severe aortic valve stenosis.
3. Inferior wall ischemia and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
4. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with poor leaflet apposition.
5. Mild aortic stenosis.
6. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7. Hypotension and possible cardiogenic shock.
8. Potential C. diff infection.
9. New-onset AFib.

It is important to monitor and manage these complications appropriately to optimize the patient's condition and prevent further complications."

   Imaging: TEE
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is
   seen in the body of the left or right atrium. No atrial septal defect
   is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%) with inferolateral hypokinesis.
   The aortic valve leaflets are moderately-to-severely
   thickened/deformed. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
   valve. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
   thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate
   (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. IABP seen in the
   descending aorta.
   IMPRESSION: Thickened mitral valve leaflets with moderate (+2) MR.
   Posterior mitral leaflet appeared teathered, likely secondary to
   ischemia. No mitral leaflet flail seen. Severely thickened aortic valve
   leaflets with moderate aortic stenosis. IABP seen in the descending
   aorta.
   TTE
   The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
   cavity size are normal. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with moderate to severe hypokinesis of the basal to mid
   inferior and inferolateral segments. The other segments have
   hyperdynamic function. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is partial mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with inferior
   infarction/ischemia. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with poor
   leaflet apposition. This may be due to ischemic papillary muscle
   dysfunction or possible partial flail of the mitral leaflet. At least
   mild aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to cardiogenic shock, which was initially thought to be preload-dependent but later considered systolic failure. She has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) likely secondary to ischemia of the posterior papillary muscle, as well as moderate aortic stenosis. Her left ventricular (LV) systolic function is low normal, with inferolateral hypokinesis. She also has mild tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation of hypotension and low urine output suggests cardiogenic shock. This is supported by the presence of an inferior STEMI and the need for IABP placement. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to maintain adequate cardiac output and organ perfusion.
2. Severe mitral regurgitation (MR): The patient's severe MR is likely due to ischemia of the posterior papillary muscle. This can lead to volume overload, pulmonary edema, and worsening heart failure. Monitoring for signs of congestive symptoms and managing fluid balance are important. Surgical intervention may be considered"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI.
- She underwent primary PCI to the mid-RCA and her CK levels peaked at 3000.
- The patient is currently intubated and on ventilatory support in the ICU.
- She has been diagnosed with hypotension/shock, possibly due to cardiogenic or septic shock, with elevated WBC count.
- There is a concern for possible Clostridium difficile infection, but no fever or diarrhea has been reported.
- The patient's lactate levels are low, and a chest X-ray shows signs consistent with pulmonary edema and/or pneumonia in the left lower lobe.
- The patient received fluid boluses but did not respond, leading to the consideration of systolic failure. She is now on a dopamine drip and lasix for diuresis.
- The patient's mitral valve leaflets are thickened with moderate mitral regurgitation, and there is severe aortic stenosis seen on TEE.
- She has regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with inferior infarction/ischemia.
- The patient is also being monitored for possible Clostridium difficile diarrhea, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.
- She has multiple lines, including a PA catheter and IABP line, and is receiving various medications and prophylactic treatments."

   - Will attempt to get volume off with UF to decrease MR
   - Will continue IABP for better CO
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   #. Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   - TTE today
   # Hypotension/shock: cardiogenic vs septic shock. wbc count elevated.
   no fever. ?h/o c diff +ve. no h/o fever or diarrhea. Lactate low. CXR
   consistent with pulm edema and/or PNA of LLL. Tried fluid boluses as
   thought cardiogenic shock may be preload dependent given RCA infarct
   but UOP did not increase and had to increase dopa so may consider this
   to be systolic failure and may need to diurese for better CO.
   - Cte IABP until no longer necessary
   - hold off on anti-HTNs
   - Consider amio to keep in NSR for better forward flow with atrial
   kick.
   - Continue dopa

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the ICU after experiencing an inferior STEMI and underwent primary PCI to the mid-RCA. She has since developed several medical complications, including severe mitral regurgitation (MR), acute renal failure (ARF), hypotension/shock, and possible Clostridium difficile infection.

Medical Complications:
1. Severe Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The patient has posterior papillary muscle ischemia and severe MR, but not a flail leaflet. The plan is to attempt to reduce the volume with ultrafiltration (UF) to decrease MR. Continuous intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support will be maintained for better cardiac output (CO). If the condition worsens, mitral valve replacement (MVR) may be necessary.
2. Inferior STEMI: The patient had a peak CK level of 3000 and has been started on aspirin 325 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg, and simvastatin 80 mg at home. Carvedilol and lisinopril have been held due to hypotension. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed today.
3. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension and shock, which may be cardiogenic or septic in origin. Her"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a chief complaint of renal failure and acute myocardial infarction. He was placed on invasive ventilation and underwent an ultrasound. A dialysis catheter was started on the same day. The patient's renal function deteriorated due to contrast-induced nephropathy, leading to the decision to initiate continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient's allergy is cefazolin, which caused a rash. Current medications include heparin sodium, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), dopamine, and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/34 mmHg to 118/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of 45/27 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 3.7 L/min, and cardiac index (CI) of 2.4 L/min/m2. Fluid balance indicates an input of 1,545 mL and output of 298 mL through blood products, with urine output of 45 mL. Respiratory support includes high flow nebulization, CPAP/PSV mode, Vt of 400 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR of 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 95%, PIP of 16 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 99%. ABG results show pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, HCO3 of 115 mEq/L, BE of -6, Ve of 6.5 L/min, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 121. Peripheral vascular examination was not assessed, while neurologic examination showed the patient responding appropriately but with unassessed movement, tone, and skin examination. Lab results include WBC count of 16.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.4%, platelet count of 140 K/uL, creatinine of 3.2 mg/dL, TCO2 of 22 mmHg, glucose of 98 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. The patient's condition requires close monitoring due to acute renal failure and myocardial infarction. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, line placement, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI. She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is on invasive ventilation. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's ARDS may worsen if she develops further lung injury or if her respiratory support is inadequate.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may progress if her cardiac function does not improve, leading to decreased tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. AKI: The patient's AKI may worsen if her renal function continues to deteriorate, potentially leading to the need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may persist or recur, potentially leading to further hemodynamic instability and an increased risk of thromboembolic events.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk of developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic measures should be implemented to prevent this complication.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) for an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
- The patient has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia but does not have a flail leaflet. The plan is to attempt to reduce the volume overload with ultrafiltration (UF) to decrease MR.
- The patient continues to be on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support for better cardiac output (CO).
- The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. There is no fever, but there is a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) positive result. No fever or diarrhea symptoms are present.
- The patient has hypotension and is in cardiogenic shock, likely due to the RCA infarct. Fluid boluses were given initially, but the urine output did not increase. Dopamine was increased, and diuresis may be considered to improve CO.
- The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy and poor CO. Renal ultrasound (US) showed no hydronephrosis, masses, or stones, but bilateral renal cysts were noted."

   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for

   # MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a flail
   leaflet
   - Will attempt to get volume off with UF to decrease MR
   - Will continue IABP for better CO; 1:2 pulsations
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia, thrombocytopenia: bleeding vs hemolysis in setting of IABP.
   Will check hemolysis panel, transfuse for HCT>30. Concern for HIT, will
   check PF4 AB.
   # Hypotension/shock: cardiogenic vs septic shock. wbc count elevated.
   no fever. ?h/o c diff +ve. no h/o fever or diarrhea. Lactate low. CXR
   consistent with pulm edema and/or PNA of LLL. Tried fluid boluses as
   thought cardiogenic shock may be preload dependent given RCA infarct
   but UOP did not increase and had to increase dopa so may consider this
   to be systolic failure and may need to diurese for better CO. Renal saw
   and recommended UF. Intermittent v pacing resulting in disynchroinous
   IABP pulsation. Doing better with 1:2 IABP. Wil rececheck ECG today, if
   suinus then 1:1 for imptoved ABP and therefore potentiating better UF.
   - Cte IABP
   - hold off on anti-HTNs
   - Consider amio to keep in NSR for better forward flow with atrial
   kick.
   - Continue dopa
   - Continue UF
   - will ask EP to look at pacer since seems to have some irregular
   pacing spikes on telemetry and did not interrogate ppm yesterday
   # ARF: Likely secondary to two dye loads as well as poor CO
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   - urine eos negative.
   #. Afib: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension
   - continue IV heparin
   - BB for rate control, will add amniodarone

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the ICU after experiencing an inferior STEMI and underwent primary PCI to the mid-RCA. The patient has multiple medical complications including severe mitral regurgitation, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and hyperparathyroidism. She is currently on various medications including heparin, dopamine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), pantoprazole, aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, and lisinopril. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 98/38 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. She has bilateral pitting edema and elevated jugular venous pressure. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's recent ECG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation with posterior papillary muscle ischemia. If left untreated, this can lead to heart failure and pulmonary edema.
2. Anemia and Throm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. The patient also has moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle ischemia but does not have a flail leaflet. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and low blood pressure, as well as abnormal heart rhythms including atrial fibrillation and pacing. She has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, septic shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her kidney function is impaired, possibly due to dye loads and poor cardiac output. 

The patient's medications include heparin, dopamine, pantoprazole, aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, and other medications for various conditions. She has been receiving intravenous fluids, intermittent blood pressure support, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and signs of poor perfusion indicate cardiogenic shock, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation suggest the possibility of ARDS, which can lead to acute respiratory failure and potentially death if not treated appropriately.
3. Kidney failure: The patient's impaired kidney function may progress to kidney failure if not addressed"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   # MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a flail
   leaflet
   - Will attempt to get volume off with UF to decrease MR
   - Will continue IABP for better CO; currently 1:2 pulsations
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia, thrombocytopenia: bleeding vs hemolysis in setting of IABP.
   Will check hemolysis panel, transfuse for HCT>30. Concern for HIT, will
   check PF4 AB.
   # Hypotension/shock: cardiogenic shock. Curtrently on UF with -1.5 lt
   yesterday. Intermittent v pacing resulting in disynchroinous IABP
   pulsation. Doing better with 1:2 IABP. Wil rececheck ECG today, if
   sinus then IABP at 1:1 for improved ABP and therefore potentiating
   better UF.
   - Cte IABP
   - hold off on anti-HTNs
   - Consider amio to keep in NSR for better forward flow with atrial
   kick.
   - Continue dopa
   - Continue UF
   - will ask EP to look at pacer since seems to have some irregular
   pacing spikes on telemetry and did not interrogate ppm yesterday
   # ARF: Likely secondary to two dye loads as well as poor CO
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   - urine eos negative.
   #. Afib: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension
   - continue IV heparin
   - BB for rate control, will add amniodarone
   # HTN: hold amlodipine, BB, ACE as pt hypotensive
   #. COPD: cont home combivent
   #. Hyperparathyroidism: cont sensipar

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease.
- She underwent primary PCI to the mid-right coronary artery for an inferior STEMI.
- The patient has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) but not a flail leaflet.
- She is experiencing cardiogenic shock due to inferior STEMI and apparent papillary muscle dysfunction with marked MR.
- The patient is on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, dopamine, and is being treated with various medications for her conditions.
- She has a negative fluid balance due to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
- The plan is to continue the negative fluid balance, IABP, and pressor support.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is 21%, and she will be transfused to maintain a HCT >30%.
- There is concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), so a platelet function test (PF4 AB) will be checked.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and her electrolytes are within normal limits.
- She has an elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count.
- The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation, and attempts have been made to control her heart rate with medications.
- Her renal function is impaired, likely secondary to two dye loads and poor cardiac output.
- The patient's code status is discussed, and she has expressed a desire for full code status but only if not on a ventilator for an extended period and not improving.
- The patient's disposition and further plans are outlined in the protected section of the note.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening cardiogenic shock: The patient is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock due to inferior STEMI and apparent papillary muscle dysfunction with marked MR. If her condition worsens, it may lead to further decline in her cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.

2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient is on multiple pressors and IABP support, which indicates significant hemodynamic instability. Any further deterioration in her condition could result in unstable blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs.

3. Renal failure: The patient has impaired renal function, and her creatinine levels are elevated. If her renal function continues to deteriorate, it may necessitate renal replacement therapy such as dialysis.

4. Bleeding complications: The patient has thrombocytopenia and is on anticoagulation therapy with heparin. There is concern for HIT, and she may require a platelet transfusion. Bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, should be monitored for.

5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease.
- She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery for an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
- The patient has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) but no flail leaflet.
- Her ejection fraction is low, and she is in cardiogenic shock with hypotension and pulmonary edema.
- She has acute kidney injury (AKI) likely due to two dye loads and poor cardiac output.
- The patient also has new-onset atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is on intermittent ventricular pacing.
- She has COPD and hyperparathyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low ejection fraction and hypotension indicate cardiogenic shock. This condition can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Severe Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The patient's severe MR can result in volume overload in the left atrium and ventricle, leading to pulmonary congestion and further deterioration of cardiac function.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's AKI is likely secondary to two dye loads and poor cardiac output. If not managed promptly, it can progress to chronic kidney disease and increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
4. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient's new-onset AFib increases the risk of thromboembolic events and may contribute to hemodynamic instability.
5. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema can worsen if the MR and cardiogenic shock are not adequately managed, leading to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient is at an increased risk of infections due to her prolonged hospitalization, invasive lines, and immunosuppressive state.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and the presence of multiple comorbidities increase the patient's risk of developing DVT and PE.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to optimize the patient's outcomes and prevent further deterioration."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). She also has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) due to ischemia of the posterior papillary muscle but does not have a flail leaflet. The patient's condition has been complicated by cardiogenic shock, possibly secondary to the inferior STEMI and severe MR. She has required intensive care unit (ICU) admission for close monitoring and management of her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and signs of poor perfusion indicate cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention.
2. Severe mitral regurgitation (MR): The patient's severe MR is likely contributing to her cardiogenic shock and could potentially worsen if not managed appropriately.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of wheezing and crackles in the lungs, along with elevated lactic acid levels, suggest the possibility of ARDS, which can be caused by various factors such as sepsis, pneumonia, or fluid overload.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels indicate potential kidney dysfunction, which may be related to her"

   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   # MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a flail
   leaflet
   - Will attempt to get volume off with UF to decrease MR
   - Will continue IABP for better CO; currently 1:2 pulsations
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia, thrombocytopenia: bleeding vs hemolysis in setting of IABP.
   Will check hemolysis panel, transfuse for HCT>30. Concern for HIT, will
   check PF4 AB.
   # Hypotension/shock: cardiogenic shock. Curtrently on UF with -1.5 lt
   yesterday. Intermittent v pacing resulting in disynchroinous IABP
   pulsation. Doing better with 1:2 IABP. Wil rececheck ECG today, if
   sinus then IABP at 1:1 for improved ABP and therefore potentiating
   better UF.
   - Cte IABP
   - hold off on anti-HTNs
   - Consider amio to keep in NSR for better forward flow with atrial
   kick.
   - Continue dopa
   - Continue UF
   - will ask EP to look at pacer since seems to have some irregular
   pacing spikes on telemetry and did not interrogate ppm yesterday
   # ARF: Likely secondary to two dye loads as well as poor CO
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   - urine eos negative.
   #. Afib: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension
   - continue IV heparin
   - BB for rate control, will add amniodarone

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). She also has moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia but does not have a flail leaflet.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, anemia, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), acute renal failure (ARF), and hypotension. She is receiving various treatments such as intravenous fluids (UF), intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), dopamine, and heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/38 mmHg to 109/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hypotension and low cardiac output indicate ongoing cardiogenic shock. This condition can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has evidence of anemia and thrombocytopenia, which can be attributed to bleeding or hemolysis associated with the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has developed new-onset AFib, which can result in reduced cardiac output and increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Rate control and rhythm management strategies should be considered.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, likely due to multiple factors including dye loads and poor cardiac output. Close monitoring and consideration of renal replacement therapy may be necessary.

5. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires careful management to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. Adjustments in fluid administration and vasoactive medications may be required.

6. Infection Risk: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).

7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness predispose the patient to develop DVT. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent clot formation.

8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Stress ulcer prophylaxis is essential to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in critically ill patients.

9. Glycemic Control: The patient's glycemic control should be monitored closely to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia,"

   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. Currenltly in cardiogenic shock; treated with dopamine,
   IABP, and UF. Overall -3.5 lt yesterday. PAd was improving through the
   day (as low as17) but rose this morning. The validity of this rise is
   questionable since CI improved during the same time frame, and if PAd
   was truly elevated this would cause decrease in CI.
   - Plan is to continue IABP to maintain pressure for UF. Once PAd at
   acceptable range ~10, then wean IABP.
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - Attempt to wean dopamine
   - If can wean dopamine, may be able to wean IABP
   - Plan for surgery at some point
   - Repeat Echo today
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   - continue CVVH for volume removal
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia: Hemolysis unlikely given normal hapto and t bili. On my read
   PBS only occasional schistos. Rectal
 for hemocult. S/P 2pRBCs with
   appropriate post transfusion response. Despite the lack of strongly
   positive hemolysis [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 3468**] caused by IABP is still strongly
   supported by history. Will continue to monitor. If cont to drop with
   scan for RP bleed.
   # TCP: most likely IABP induced. However HIT is very likely. Sent HIT
   and transitioned to argatroban. Plan is that if plt rise with this
   change, then most likely HIT and would cont argatroban; if platelets
   cont to drop and [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, receiving dopamine and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. She has a low cardiac output (CI) and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for volume removal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is already in cardiogenic shock, which requires immediate medical intervention to stabilize her condition. Continued monitoring and appropriate management, including weaning off dopamine and IABP, will be necessary.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an acute kidney injury likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy. Close monitoring of renal function and following up with renal recommendations are essential.
3. Hemolysis: Although hemolysis is unlikely given the normal levels of hapto and bilirubin, it should still be monitored. A repeat echocardiogram has been planned to assess for any worsening hemolysis.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. Currenltly in cardiogenic shock; treated with dopamine,
   IABP, and UF. Overall -3.5 lt yesterday. PAd was improving through the
   day (as low as17) but rose this morning. The validity of this rise is
   questionable since CI improved during the same time frame, and if PAd
   was truly elevated this would cause decrease in CI.
   - Plan is to continue IABP to maintain pressure for UF. Once PAd at
   acceptable range ~10, then wean IABP.
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia: Hemolysis unlikely given normal hapto and t bili. On my read
   PBS only occasional schistos. Rectal
 for hemocult. S/P 2pRBCs with
   appropriate post transfusion response. Despite the lack of strongly
   positive hemolysis [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 3468**] caused by IABP is still strongly
   supported by history. Will continue to monitor. If cont to drop with
   scan for RP bleed.
   # TCP: most likely IABP induced. However HIT is very likely. Sent HIT
   and transitioned to argatroban. Plan is that if plt rise with this
   change, then most likely HIT and would cont argatroban; if platelets
   cont to drop and [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], then IABP-cause and then would go back to
   heparin.
   # ARF: Contrast induced and poor forward flow. Improving on UF.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   - urine eos negative.
   #. Afib: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension
   - continue argatroban
   - BB for rate control, will add amniodarone

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD). She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) for inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock and is being treated with dopamine, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and ultrafiltrate (UF). 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), troponin T, and cardiac enzymes such as CK-MB. There are also abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase) and kidney function (creatinine). The platelet count is low at 69,000/mL, and there is evidence of hemolysis.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/38 to 137/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on face tent, and temperature within normal limits. The physical examination reveals jugular venous distention (JVD), an irregularly irregular heartbeat, and a systolic murmur best heard at the apex. There is also bilateral pitting edema and wheezing and crackles in the chest.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, CAD, and hyperpar"

   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   # MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a flail
   leaflet
   - Will attempt to get volume off with UF to decrease MR
   - Will continue IABP for better CO; currently 1:2 pulsations
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia, thrombocytopenia: bleeding vs hemolysis in setting of IABP.
   Will check hemolysis panel, transfuse for HCT>30. Concern for HIT, will
   check PF4 AB.
   # Hypotension/shock: cardiogenic shock. Curtrently on UF with -1.5 lt
   yesterday. Intermittent v pacing resulting in disynchroinous IABP
   pulsation. Doing better with 1:2 IABP. Wil rececheck ECG today, if
   sinus then IABP at 1:1 for improved ABP and therefore potentiating
   better UF.
   - Cte IABP
   - hold off on anti-HTNs
   - Consider amio to keep in NSR for better forward flow with atrial
   kick.
   - Continue dopa
   - Continue UF
   - will ask EP to look at pacer since seems to have some irregular
   pacing spikes on telemetry and did not interrogate ppm yesterday
   # ARF: Likely secondary to two dye loads as well as poor CO
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   - urine eos negative.
   #. Afib: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension
   - continue IV heparin
   - BB for rate control, will add amniodarone

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. She has been experiencing anemia, ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, and myocardial infarction. The patient is currently on several medications including calcium gluconate, dopamine, argatroban, and potassium chloride. Her vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/38 to 137/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter, and she has a central venous pressure of 26 mmHg. She is receiving respiratory support with a face tent and supplemental oxygen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate possible acute renal failure. This condition requires close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.

2. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels suggest a recent myocardial infarction. It is crucial to monitor her cardiac status and provide appropriate cardiac support.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged PTT/INR indicate a coagulopathy. The use of lepirudin and argatroban suggests a concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (H"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. Currenltly in cardiogenic shock; treated with dopamine,
   IABP, and UF. Overall -3.5 lt yesterday. PAd was improving through the
   day (as low as17) but rose this morning. The validity of this rise is
   questionable since CI improved during the same time frame, and if PAd
   was truly elevated this would cause decrease in CI.
   - Plan is to continue IABP to maintain pressure for UF. Once PAd at
   acceptable range ~10, then wean IABP.
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - Attempt to wean dopamine
   - If can wean dopamine, may be able to wean IABP
   - Plan for surgery at some point
   - Repeat Echo today
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   - continue CVVH for volume removal
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia: Hemolysis unlikely given normal hapto and t bili. On my read
   PBS only occasional schistos. Rectal
 for hemocult. S/P 2pRBCs with
   appropriate post transfusion response. Despite the lack of strongly
   positive hemolysis [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 3468**] caused by IABP is still strongly
   supported by history. Will continue to monitor. If cont to drop with
   scan for RP bleed.
   # TCP: most likely IABP induced. However HIT is very likely. Sent HIT
   and transitioned to argatroban. Plan is that if plt rise with this
   change, then most likely HIT and would cont argatroban; if platelets
   cont to drop and [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], then IABP-cause and then would go back to
   heparin.
   # ARF: Contrast induced and poor forward flow. Improving on UF.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   - urine eos negative.
   #. Afib: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension
   - continue argatroban
   - BB for rate control, will add amniodarone

   attempt to wean dopamine.  If tolerates this, then we may attempt
   initiation of dobutamine in an effort to begin weaning IABP.  Plan
   otherwise as outlined above.  ICU care due to cardiogenic shock and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. She is currently in cardiogenic shock and is being treated with dopamine, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and ultrafiltration (UF).

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is a severe condition characterized by inadequate circulation and perfusion of organs due to impaired cardiac function. The treatment plan includes continuing with dopamine and IABP to maintain blood pressure and flow. Once the patient's pulmonary artery pressure (PAd) reaches an acceptable range of around 10, the IABP may be weaned off.

2. Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The patient has severe MR but not a flail leaflet. There is posterior papillary muscle ischemia contributing to the MR. The plan is to continue intra-aortic balloon pumping until the PAd is at an acceptable level, then attempt to wean off IABP. Repeat echocardiography will be done today, and surgery for mitral valve repair or replacement (MVR) may be necessary if the patient's condition worsens.

3. Inferior STEMI: The patient had an inferior STEMI, which has been treated with primary PCI to the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with multiple medical complications. He has a history of allergies to cefazolin and previous antibiotic use. The patient is currently receiving several infusions, including calcium gluconate, dopamine, argatroban, and potassium chloride. He has been diagnosed with anemia, ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, and myocardial infarction. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is on respiratory support with a face tent and has a low oxygen saturation of 97%. His blood pressure is low at 106/38 mmHg, and his heart rate is within normal range at 80 bpm. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 44-46%. Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,549 mL and total output of 6,575 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,026 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition requires close monitoring in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate acute renal failure. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and buildup of waste products in the body.
2. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's symptoms and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest a myocardial infarction"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. Currenltly in cardiogenic shock; treated with dopamine,
   IABP, and UF. Overall -3.5 lt yesterday. PAd was improving through the
   day (as low as17) but rose this morning. The validity of this rise is
   questionable since CI improved during the same time frame, and if PAd
   was truly elevated this would cause decrease in CI.
   - Plan is to continue IABP to maintain pressure for UF. Once PAd at
   acceptable range ~10, then wean IABP.
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - Attempt to wean dopamine
   - If can wean dopamine, may be able to wean IABP
   - Plan for surgery at some point
   - Repeat Echo today
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   - continue CVVH for volume removal
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia: Hemolysis unlikely given normal hapto and t bili. On my read
   PBS only occasional schistos. Rectal
 for hemocult. S/P 2pRBCs with
   appropriate post transfusion response. Despite the lack of strongly
   positive hemolysis [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 3468**] caused by IABP is still strongly
   supported by history. Will continue to monitor. If cont to drop with
   scan for RP bleed.
   # TCP: most likely IABP induced. However HIT is very likely. Sent HIT
   and transitioned to argatroban. Plan is that if plt rise with this
   change, then most likely HIT and would cont argatroban; if platelets
   cont to drop and [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], then IABP-cause and then would go back to
   heparin.
   # ARF: Contrast induced and poor forward flow. Improving on UF.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   - urine eos negative.
   #. Afib: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension
   - continue argatroban
   - BB for rate control, will add amniodarone
   # COPD: cont home combivent
   # Hyperparathyroidism: cont sensipar

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequently underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). She has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is currently in cardiogenic shock, requiring treatment with dopamine, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and ultrafiltrate (UF). Her pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) have been improving but rose this morning, possibly due to a questionable rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (Pad). 

The plan is to continue IABP to maintain pressures for UF, wean dopamine once at an acceptable range, and potentially wean IABP as well. Amiodarone will be given to maintain atrial pacing, and an attempt will be made to wean off dopamine. Surgery, specifically mitral valve replacement (MVR), may be planned if necessary. The patient is also on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for volume removal. 

She had an inferior STEMI that was treated with primary PCI to the mid-RCA. The peak creatine kinase (CK) level was 3000. She is on aspirin, clopidogrel, and simvastatin, but carvedilol and lisinopril have been withheld due to hypotension.

The patient also has anemia, which is unlikely to be caused by hemolysis given normal haptoglobin and total bilirubin levels. However, there is a suspicion of interventional balloon pump (IABP)-induced thrombocytopenia (TCP), and she has been transitioned from heparin to argatroban due to a likely heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). If platelets continue to drop, alternative treatments may be considered.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF), which is likely contrast-induced and due to poor forward flow. Her urine eosinophils are negative, and further renal recommendations are being followed up on. Additionally, she has new-onset atrial fibrillation (Afib), for which she underwent direct current cardioversion (DCCV) for hypotension. She is continuing on argatroban and beta-blockers for rate control, with amiodarone being added.

The patient also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hyperparathyroidism, which require ongoing management. Her ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Overall, the patient's medical complications include cardiogenic shock, potential HIT, anemia, ARF, new-onset Afib, and COPD."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI. She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) and now has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia. The patient is in cardiogenic shock and is being treated with dopamine, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and ultrafiltration (UF). Despite short cessation of IABP during transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) yesterday, her pressures dropped precipitously.

The plan is to wean off IABP and continue with dopamine. Amiodarone has been added to maintain atrial pacing. Surgery is planned at some point, and the patient will continue to be monitored for worsening condition that may require mitral valve replacement (MVR). Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) will be continued for volume removal, and consideration will be given to dobutamine/milrinone if blood pressures allow it.

The patient also has anemia secondary to 2 packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions, hematoma near the IABP site, leukocytosis, possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and acute renal failure (ARF) due to contrast-induced nephrop"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery for inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 

The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock and is being treated with dopamine, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and ultrafiltration (UF). The patient has experienced a significant drop in blood pressure when the IABP was temporarily removed during a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) yesterday. 

The plan is to wean off the IABP and continue with dopamine therapy. Amiodarone has been added to maintain atrial pacing. The patient will require surgery at some point, possibly mitral valve replacement (MVR), depending on her condition. Continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) will be continued for volume removal, and consideration will be given to using dobutamine or milrinone if blood pressures allow. 

The patient also has anemia, leukocytosis, and possible heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Cultures and chest X-ray will be obtained, and the IABP will be pulled if possible today. The patient is also at risk for contrast-induced acute kidney injury (ARF) and has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). 

In addition, the patient has atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hyperparathyroidism, all of which require ongoing management. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control will be monitored, and she is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, involving multiple organ systems and requiring intensive care unit (ICU) management."

   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. Currently in cardiogenic shock; treated with dopamine,
   IABP, and UF. Overall -2 lt yesterday. With short cessation of IABP
   during TTE yesterday pressures dropped precipitously (to 60s).
   - Plan is to wean IABP today to 1:4

   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - continue CVVH for volume removal
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia: S/P total 3pRBCs with appropriate post transfusion response.
   Has hematoma near IABP site now.
   - Likely cause is hemolysis from IABP.
   - Out of concern for HIT started argatroban
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 7**], transfuse to Hct goal of 30 and Platelets of 10, or if
   spontaneous bleeding.
   - Pull IABP if able today after wean down
   # Leukocytosis:  trending down, unclear cause,
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Continue empiric vancomycin
   - CXR today as well.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Staying stable, most likely IABP induced. However
   HIT is very likely. Sent HIT and transitioned to argatroban.
   - Will pull IABP if able as above
   -recheck platelets later today and if <10 or spontaneous bleed will

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI. She underwent primary PCI to the mid-RCA and has been admitted to the ICU. She is currently in cardiogenic shock and is being treated with dopamine, IABP, and ultrafiltration. Her labs show evidence of acute kidney injury, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy, as well as elevated troponin levels. She has a hematoma near the IABP site and is being monitored for potential bleeding complications. The patient also has leukocytosis and a possible infection, for which cultures have been sent. She has been started on argatroban for suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Other medical conditions include anemia, COPD, and hyperparathyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, which can lead to hypotension, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not properly managed.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine and low urine output suggest AKI, which can be caused by contrast-induced nephropathy, hypotension, or sepsis.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient has a hematoma near the IABP site, and her platelet count is low. This raises concerns for bleeding complications, especially if"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. Currently in cardiogenic shock; treated with dopamine,
   IABP, and UF. Overall -2 lt yesterday. MVO2 improved and pressor
   requirement decreased from yesterday so clinically slightly better with
   dobutamine despite weaning IABP.
   - Plan is to wean IABP today as BPs tolerate while following EKGs to
   ensure no cardiac ischemia and increase dobutamine as possible to
   reduce afterload. Goal SBP 100.
   - continue dopa and dobutamine (wean dopa as tolerated).
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - continue CVVH for volume removal
   - repeating TTE today to look for worsening MR vs new mechanical
   complication of inferior STEMI
   - Will likely need A-line today as well
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia: S/P total 3pRBCs with appropriate post transfusion response.
   Has hematoma near IABP site now stable from yesterday and had very
   slightly positive guaiac in stool but not enough to explain anemia.
   - Likely cause is hemolysis from IABP.
   - Out of concern for HIT started argatroban. HIT antibodies pending.
   Will cls hematology for argatroban per protocol.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 7**], transfuse to Hct goal of 30 and Platelets of 10, or if
   spontaneous bleeding.
   - Pull IABP if able today after wean down
   # Leukocytosis:  trending down, unclear cause,
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Continue empiric vancomycin
   - f/u CXR today to ensure no evidence of pna
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Staying stable, most likely IABP induced. However
   HIT is very likely. Sent HIT and transitioned to argatroban.
   - Will pull IABP if able as above and give platelets prior as <50
   currently
   -recheck platelets later today and if <10 or spontaneous bleed will
   transfuse
   # ARF: Now much improved on UF. Might have been contrast nephropathy,
   still oliguric however so still requires CVVH
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   #. Rhythm: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension on admission and
   pace-maker induced tachycardia now resolved with increasing the PVARP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) that was complicated by posterior papillary muscle ischemia and mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, treated with dopamine, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and ultrafiltration (UF). She has shown improvement in myocardial oxygen demand (MVO2) and decreased pressor requirement, indicating some clinical improvement with dobutamine therapy. The plan is to wean the IABP and increase the dose of dobutamine as tolerated, aiming for a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 100 mmHg.

Other ongoing issues include anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF), and new-onset atrial fibrillation. The anemia is believed to be caused by hemolysis from the IABP, and the patient is being monitored for HIT antibodies due to the use of argatroban. The leukocytosis is trending down, but the cause is unclear. The thrombocytopenia is likely due to IABP-induced hem"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. Currenltly in cardiogenic shock; treated with dopamine,
   IABP, and UF. Overall -2 lt yesterday. With short cessation of IABP
   during TTE yesterday pressures dropped precipitously (to 60s).
   - Plan is to wean IABP and continue dopa.
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - Plan for surgery at some point
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   - continue CVVH for volume removal
   - Consider dobutamine/milrinone if BPs allow it
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia: S/P 2pRBCs with appropriate post transfusion response. Has
   hematoma near IABP site now.
   - Possibly bled from IABP although could have had small amount
   hemolysis as well from IABP.
   -Out of concern for HIT started argatroban
   - Will continue to monitor. If cont to drop with scan for RP bleed.
   - Pull IABP if able today
   # Leukocytosis: Will send cultures today although may be clouded
   because started vanc last pm.
   - CXR today as well.
   # TCP: most likely IABP induced. However HIT is very likely. Sent HIT
   and transitioned to argatroban. Pla was that if plt rise with this
   change, then most likely HIT and would cont argatroban; if platelets
   cont to drop and [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], then IABP-cause and then would go back to
   heparin.
   - Will pull IABP if able as above
   -recheck platelets later today and if <10 or spontaneous bleed will
   transfuse
   # ARF: Contrast induced and poor forward flow. Improving on UF.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   - urine eos negative.
   #. Afib: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension

","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) for an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock and is being treated with dopamine, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and ultrafiltrate (UF). Her condition worsened yesterday when the IABP was temporarily removed, leading to a significant drop in blood pressure. 

The plan is to wean off the IABP and continue with dopamine therapy. Amiodarone will be given to maintain atrial pacing. Surgery is planned at some point, and the possibility of mitral valve replacement (MVR) may be considered if the patient's condition worsens. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) will be continued for volume removal, and the use of dobutamine/milrinone may be considered if blood pressures allow it.

The patient also has a history of anemia, which was treated with 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). A hematoma near the IABP site has developed, possibly due to bleeding from the IABP or small amount of hemolysis. Argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has been started due to concerns of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia"

   IABP, and UF. Overall -2 lt yesterday. MVO2 improved and pressor
   requirement decreased from yesterday so clinically slightly better with
   dobutamine despite weaning IABP.
   - Plan is to wean IABP today as BPs tolerate while following EKGs to

   Has hematoma near IABP site now stable from yesterday and had very
   slightly positive guaiac in stool but not enough to explain anemia.
   - Likely cause is hemolysis from IABP.
   - Out of concern for HIT started argatroban. HIT antibodies pending.
   Will cls hematology for argatroban per protocol.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. Post-procedure, she developed papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock and is being treated with dopamine, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and ultrafiltrate (UF). Her mixed venous oxygen saturation has improved, and her pressor requirements have decreased. However, she is still experiencing hemodynamic instability, and her blood pressure is low. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by impaired cardiac output. It can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure if not managed promptly and effectively.

2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hemodynamic instability. This could be due to her cardiogenic shock or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to maintain adequate perfusion to vital organs.

3. Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The patient has developed moderate MR following her inferior STEMI. MR can result in volume overload in the left atrium and ventricle, leading to pulmonary congestion and symptoms such as shortness of breath and"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. Currenltly in cardiogenic shock; treated with dopamine,
   IABP, and UF. Overall -2 lt yesterday. With short cessation of IABP
   during TTE yesterday pressures dropped precipitously (to 60s).
   - Plan is to wean IABP and continue dopa.
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - Plan for surgery at some point
   - Will continue to monitor and if gets worse may need MVR
   - continue CVVH for volume removal
   - Consider dobutamine/milrinone if BPs allow it
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - hold carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia: S/P 2pRBCs with appropriate post transfusion response. Has
   hematoma near IABP site now.
   - Possibly bled from IABP although could have had small amount
   hemolysis as well from IABP.
   -Out of concern for HIT started argatroban
   - Will continue to monitor. If cont to drop with scan for RP bleed.
   - Pull IABP if able today
   # Leukocytosis: Will send cultures today although may be clouded
   because started vanc last pm.
   - CXR today as well.
   # TCP: most likely IABP induced. However HIT is very likely. Sent HIT
   and transitioned to argatroban. Pla was that if plt rise with this
   change, then most likely HIT and would cont argatroban; if platelets
   cont to drop and [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], then IABP-cause and then would go back to
   heparin.
   - Will pull IABP if able as above
   -recheck platelets later today and if <10 or spontaneous bleed will
   transfuse
   # ARF: Contrast induced and poor forward flow. Improving on UF.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   - urine eos negative.
   #. Afib: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension
   - continue argatroban
   - added amniodarone

","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery for an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She is currently in cardiogenic shock and is being treated with dopamine, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and ultrafiltrate (UF). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the events mentioned above. Her laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, but elevated levels of creatinine, troponin-T, CK-MB, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes. Her electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed. Firstly, she has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) with posterior papillary muscle ischemia but no flail leaflet. The plan is to wean the IABP and continue with dopamine. If her condition worsens, mitral valve replacement (MVR) may be necessary. She will also continue with continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. IABP was stopped yesterday. Dopa decreased to 3, with
   dobutamine stable at 6. and Overall -1.7 lt of UF yesterday. MVO2 as
   high as 73%. Overall showing signs of improvement, ECHO shows stable
   papillary mm.
   - continue weaning dopa and start weaning dobutamine
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going (changes pacer settings
   yesterday to minimalize ventricular pacing, and this helped improve PA
   pressures)
   - continue UF for volume removal (goal -1-2L today)
   - on vanc ppx for groin lines until lines removed.
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   # Anemia: Stable HCT at 27. Most likely IABP related. Will continue to
   monitor.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely IABP induced. HIT negative. Restarted
   heparin last night.
   # ARF: Creatinine much improved on UF. Still oliguric however so still
   requires CVVH. Expect etiology is contrast nephropathy from two caths
   and CT scan as well as hypotension in setting of cardiogeneic shock.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   # Rhythm: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension on admission and
   pace-maker induced tachycardia now resolved with increasing the PVARP.
   Currently with aflutter/fib rate controlled at 60-70 bpms with less
   pacemaker spikes

   - continue amio->can change dose after loading dose finished
   - Consider pace-termination of A lead to convert to sinus

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). She also had posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).

In the ICU, the patient was placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support but it was eventually stopped. She was given dopamine and dobutamine to support her blood pressure and cardiac function. The patient had significant fluid removal, with a total outflow of 6,406 mL since 12 AM.

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a heart rate between 61-98 beats per minute and blood pressure ranging from 100/44 mmHg to 135/49 mmHg. Oxygen saturation was maintained at 98% with the help of a nasal cannula. The patient had a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F) and respiratory rate between 9-25 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination revealed jugular venous distension (JVD) elevated, irregular heart rhythm, and a systolic murmur best heard at the apex. Wheezing and crackles were heard in the"

   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. IABP was stopped yesterday. Dopa decreased to 3, with
   dobutamine stable at 6. and Overall -1.7 lt of UF yesterday. MVO2 as
   high as 73%. Overall showing signs of improvement, ECHO shows stable
   papillary mm.
   - continue weaning dopa and cont dobutamine
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going (changes pacer settings
   yesterday to minimalize ventricular pacing, and this helped improve PA
   pressures)
   - continue CVVH for volume removal
   - on vanc ppx for groin lines, may need resiting of lines
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   # Anemia: Stable HCT at 27. Most likely IABP related. Will continue to
   monitor.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely IABP induced. HIT negative. Restarted
   heparin last night.
   # ARF: Now much improved on UF. Might have been contrast nephropathy,
   still oliguric however so still requires CVVH
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   # Rhythm: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension on admission and
   pace-maker induced tachycardia now resolved with increasing the PVARP.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI. She underwent primary PCI to the mid-RCA and was found to have posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock but showed signs of improvement. She required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, which was eventually stopped. The patient's condition has been complicated by anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF), and new-onset atrial fibrillation. She is currently on CVVH for volume removal and continues to be oliguric. The patient's medication regimen includes aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, amiodarone, dobutamine, and pantoprazole. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 100/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination reveals jugular venous distention, irregular heartbeat, a systolic murmur at the apex, wheezing and crackles in the chest, bilateral pitting edema, and no femoral bruits. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelets, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Upon admission, the patient was in atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, requiring chemical cardioversion. The patient's blood pressure was unstable and required vasopressor support. Initial cardiac catheterization revealed an occluded left circumflex artery, which was treated with stenting.

Over the next few days, the patient experienced multiple complications. The patient's renal function deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure (ARF). The patient also developed anemia, ineffective coping, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and liver enzymes. The patient's blood glucose levels were also consistently high.

The patient underwent several interventions, including hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and mechanical ventilation. The patient was also started on various medications such as dopamine, dobutamine, heparin, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure. This can be indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and the need for hemodialysis and CRRT.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which could be due to immobility or pressure ulcers. This is a potential complication that needs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. She has a history of multiple medical conditions, including anemia, ineffective coping, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, and myocardial infarction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 100/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is receiving multiple medications, including dobutamine, dopamine, heparin, and pantoprazole. The patient underwent an echocardiogram, which revealed severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, moderate mitral regurgitation, and a small pericardial effusion. The patient's blood work showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output indicate acute renal failure. This can lead to fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Myocardial infarction: The patient's history"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. IABP was stopped yesterday. Dopa decreased to 3, with
   dobutamine stable at 6. and Overall -1.7 lt of UF yesterday. MVO2 as
   high as 73%. Overall showing signs of improvement, ECHO shows stable
   papillary mm.
   - continue weaning dopa and start weaning dobutamine
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going (changes pacer settings
   yesterday to minimalize ventricular pacing, and this helped improve PA
   pressures)
   - continue UF for volume removal (goal -1-2L today)
   - on vanc ppx for groin lines until lines removed.
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   # Anemia: Stable HCT at 27. Most likely IABP related. Will continue to
   monitor.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely IABP induced. HIT negative. Restarted
   heparin last night.
   # ARF: Creatinine much improved on UF. Still oliguric however so still
   requires CVVH. Expect etiology is contrast nephropathy from two caths
   and CT scan as well as hypotension in setting of cardiogeneic shock.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   # Rhythm: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension on admission and
   pace-maker induced tachycardia now resolved with increasing the PVARP.
   Currently with aflutter/fib rate controlled at 60-70 bpms with less
   pacemaker spikes
   - Heparin ggt
   - continue amio->can change dose after loading dose finished
   - Consider pace-termination of A lead to convert to sinus
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: HH-ensure with every meal
   Glycemic Control:
   Lines: Will need to resite groin lines. Will pull swan. Will send to IR
   for picc and replace CVVH line.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI. She underwent primary PCI to the mid-RCA and showed signs of improvement in her condition. However, she developed posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), but not a flail leaflet. The patient required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, but it was stopped yesterday. She is currently on dopamine and dobutamine infusions and has been receiving continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 100/44 mmHg, heart rate of 61 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Her ECG shows atrial flutter with variable ventricular response. Her 2D echo reveals severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, severely depressed overall left ventricular systolic function (LVEF = 55%), mild to moderate aortic stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, and moderate mitral regurgitation.

The patient has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure, likely related to the IABP support. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. Currently in cardiogenic shock; treated with dopamine,
   IABP, and UF. Overall -2 lt yesterday. MVO2 improved and pressor
   requirement decreased from yesterday so clinically slightly better with
   dobutamine despite weaning IABP.
   - Plan is to wean IABP today as BPs tolerate while following EKGs to
   ensure no cardiac ischemia and increase dobutamine as possible to
   reduce afterload. Goal SBP 100.
   - continue dopa and dobutamine (wean dopa as tolerated).
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - continue CVVH for volume removal
   - repeating TTE today to look for worsening MR vs new mechanical
   complication of inferior STEMI
   - Will likely need A-line today as well
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA.
   - CK peaked at 3000
   - continue aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75
   - cont home simvastatin 80
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril given hypotension
   # Anemia: S/P total 3pRBCs with appropriate post transfusion response.
   Has hematoma near IABP site now stable from yesterday and had very
   slightly positive guaiac in stool but not enough to explain anemia.
   - Likely cause is hemolysis from IABP.
   - Out of concern for HIT started argatroban. HIT antibodies pending.
   Will cls hematology for argatroban per protocol.
   - Monitor [**Hospital1 7**], transfuse to Hct goal of 30 and Platelets of 10, or if
   spontaneous bleeding.
   - Pull IABP if able today after wean down
   # Leukocytosis:  trending down, unclear cause,
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Continue empiric vancomycin
   - f/u CXR today to ensure no evidence of pna
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Staying stable, most likely IABP induced. However
   HIT is very likely. Sent HIT and transitioned to argatroban.
   - Will pull IABP if able as above and give platelets prior as <50
   currently
   -recheck platelets later today and if <10 or spontaneous bleed will
   transfuse
   # ARF: Now much improved on UF. Might have been contrast nephropathy,
   still oliguric however so still requires CVVH
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   #. Rhythm: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension on admission and
   pace-maker induced tachycardia now resolved with increasing the PVARP.
   -monitor on tele
   - continue argatroban until hit antibiodies are back
   - cte amniodarone

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI. She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. Post-procedure, she developed posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation but did not have a flail leaflet. She is currently in cardiogenic shock and is being treated with dopamine, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and ultrafiltrate (UF). Her medical history also includes a hemorrhagic stroke, for which she underwent decompressive craniectomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock due to severe mitral regurgitation and posterior papillary muscle ischemia. She is being treated with dopamine and IABP to support her blood pressure and cardiac output.
2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, with frequent fluctuations. Close monitoring and adjustment of her medication regimen, including dopamine and dobutamine, are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely caused by hemolysis from the IABP. She has received a total of 3 pints of packed red blood cells (RBCs) with an appropriate post-transfusion response. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause of the anemia.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # Cardiogenic shock/MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR
   but not a flail leaflet. IABP was discontinued without difficulty.
   Dopamine was able to be weaned completely.  Dobutamine dose remaining
   the same at 6.   As the patient was off UF for some time yesterday in
   preparation for the HD line placement she was overall even.  Overall
   showing signs of improvement.
   - continue weaning dobutamine as tolerated; consider alternative
   afterload reduction method (isosorbide mononitrate since renal failure
   exculdes acei)
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - continue UF for volume removal (goal -1-2L today)
   - will stop vanc, since groin lines removed. Monitro fever curve.
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   # Normocytic anemia:  Hct decreased to 24, likely following IABP
   removal, groin line removal and HD line placement.  Will transfuse
   today with goal of 30.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely IABP induced. HIT negative.  Stable,
   will continue to monitor, if it remains low over the next few days will
   work up alternative causes.
   # ARF: Creatinine much improved on UF. Expect etiology is contrast
   nephropathy from two caths and CT scan as well as hypotension in
   setting of cardiogeneic shock. Oligouric but shows some improvemen;
   will continue CVVH for neg fluid balance.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   # Rhythm: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension on admission and
   pace-maker induced tachycardia now resolved with increasing the PVARP.
   Currently with aflutter/fib rate controlled at 60-70 bpms with less
   pacemaker spikes
   - Heparin ggt
   - continue amiodarone
   - consulted EP regarding another attempt at pace termination and

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. The patient experienced cardiogenic shock and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia. Inotropic support was initiated, and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was placed but subsequently removed without difficulty. The patient's dopamine dosage has been weaned down to 6 mcg/kg/min.

The patient also has normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to contrast nephropathy. ARF is being managed with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient is currently in atrial flutter with a controlled rate of 60-70 beats per minute and is receiving amiodarone for rhythm control. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation of cardiogenic shock requires close monitoring of hemodynamics and continued optimization of inotropic support as tolerated.
2. Moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation: This complication may lead to volume overload and pulmonary edema. Monitoring of central venous pressure and daily echocardiogram assessments are recommended. Surgical intervention may be necessary if the mitral regurgitation worsens.
3. Acute renal failure:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient presented with symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and hypotension. Upon admission, he was found to have acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, and anemia. 

During the hospital stay, the patient underwent several interventions, including placement of an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and central venous pressure monitoring. He received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to his unstable hemodynamics. The patient also required inotropic support with dobutamine. 

The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with fluctuating blood pressures and heart rates. His oxygen saturation has remained below 92% despite supplemental oxygen. He has a history of atrial flutter with variable heart rates. 

Laboratory results indicate ongoing renal dysfunction, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's white blood cell count has shown a trend of increasing leukocytosis. 

The patient's skin integrity is compromised, with areas of pressure ulcers present. His coping mechanisms are ineffective, leading to impaired skin integrity. 

The patient's condition remains critical, and he requires close monitoring and aggressive management. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of myocardial infarction and atrial flutter"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # MR/Shock: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR but not a
   flail leaflet. IABP was discontinued without difficulty.  Dopamine was
   able to be weaned completely.  Dobutamine dose remaining the same at
   6.   As the patient was off UF for some time yesterday in preparation
   for the HD line placement she was overall even.  Overall showing signs
   of improvement.
   - continue weaning dobutamine as tolerated
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going (changes pacer settings
   yesterday to minimalize ventricular pacing, and this helped improve PA
   pressures)
   - continue UF for volume removal (goal -1-2L today)
   - on vanc ppx for groin lines until lines removed.??? (stop today)
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   # Anemia:  Hct decreased to 24, likely following IABP removal, groin
   line removal and HD line placement.  Will transfuse today with goal of
   high 20s.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely IABP induced. HIT negative.  Continue
   to monitor
   # ARF: Creatinine much improved on UF. Still oliguric however so still
   requires CVVH. Expect etiology is contrast nephropathy from two caths
   and CT scan as well as hypotension in setting of cardiogeneic shock.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   # Rhythm: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension on admission and
   pace-maker induced tachycardia now resolved with increasing the PVARP.
   Currently with aflutter/fib rate controlled at 60-70 bpms with less
   pacemaker spikes
   - Heparin ggt
   - continue amiodarone->can change dose after loading dose finished
   - consulted EP regarding another attempt at pace termination and
   declined

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). The patient also had posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), but no flail leaflet. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was discontinued without difficulty, and dopamine was weaned off completely.

The patient's current condition shows signs of improvement, and she is being managed with dobutamine, amiodarone, and ultrafiltration (UF) for volume removal. She is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for potential infections and anticoagulation therapy. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia are being closely monitored, and she continues to require continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to ongoing oliguria.

The patient's rhythm has stabilized, with a rate-controlled atrial flutter/fibrillation at 60-70 beats per minute. Further attempts at pace termination have been declined, and the patient's code status remains full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # Cardiogenic shock/MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR
   but not a flail leaflet. IABP was discontinued without difficulty.
   Dopamine was able to be weaned completely.  Dobutamine dose remaining
   the same at 6.   As the patient was off UF for some time yesterday in
   preparation for the HD line placement she was overall even.  Overall
   showing signs of improvement.
   - continue weaning dobutamine as tolerated; consider alternative
   afterload reduction method (isosorbide mononitrate since renal failure
   exculdes acei)
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - continue UF for volume removal (goal -1-2L today)
   - will stop vanc, since groin lines removed. Monitro fever curve.
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   # Normocytic anemia:  Hct decreased to 24, likely following IABP
   removal, groin line removal and HD line placement.  Will transfuse
   today with goal of 30.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely IABP induced. HIT negative.  Stable,
   will continue to monitor, if it remains low over the next few days will
   work up alternative causes.
   # ARF: Creatinine much improved on UF. Expect etiology is contrast
   nephropathy from two caths and CT scan as well as hypotension in
   setting of cardiogeneic shock. Oligouric but shows some improvemen;
   will continue CVVH for neg fluid balance.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   # Rhythm: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension on admission and
   pace-maker induced tachycardia now resolved with increasing the PVARP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. The patient developed cardiogenic shock and severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia.

The patient's current condition includes normocytic anemia with a decreased hematocrit level of 24, likely due to intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) removal, groin line removal, and hemodialysis (HD) line placement. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, which is most likely induced by IABP. Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with improved creatinine levels on urine flow (UF). The etiology of ARF is suspected to be contrast nephropathy from two catheterizations and a CT scan, as well as hypotension in the setting of cardiogenic shock.

The patient's rhythm is currently atrial flutter/fibrillation with a controlled rate of 60-70 beats per minute using amiodarone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 88/39 mmHg, heart rate of 60 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including dobutamine, heparin"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and subsequent cardiogenic shock. She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) and has been experiencing worsening renal function (ARF) likely due to contrast nephropathy from the procedures. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, which is suspected to be induced by the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). Her blood pressure remains low, and she is currently on dobutamine for cardiac support. She has developed atrial flutter/fibrillation but is rate-controlled with amiodarone. The patient's fluid balance is negative, and she is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's initial presentation of cardiogenic shock may continue to be a concern due to ongoing low blood pressure and the need for inotropic support.
2. Worsening Renal Function (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, particularly if CVVH is not effective or if additional renal insults occur.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring and addressing the underlying cause"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery for an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient developed posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). She is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock and has been weaned off all pressors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/51-118/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. She is in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response.

Laboratory results show normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 53 K/uL, and acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated heart rate indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability, which may require further intervention.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is significantly low, which increases the"

The patient has anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury (ARF), and atrial fibrillation. The anemia is multifactorial, including hemolysis from intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and blood loss during procedures. The thrombocytopenia is likely due to IABP-induced platelet consumption and local hematomas from line removals. ARF is most likely contrast nephropathy, and the patient remains oliguric with negative fluid balance. 

The patient's rhythm is now a flutter/fibrillation after new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) that resolved with increased PVARP. Heparin will be continued until procedures are finished, followed by coumadin. Amiodarone will continue. 

The patient has foot pain suspected to be gout and will be evaluated with renal consultation regarding allopurinol dosing. 

The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodial"

   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # Cardiogenic shock/MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR
   but not a flail leaflet. IABP was discontinued without difficulty.
   Dopamine was able to be weaned completely.  Dobutamine dose remaining
   the same at 6.   As the patient was off UF for some time yesterday in
   preparation for the HD line placement she was overall even.  Overall
   showing signs of improvement.
   - continue weaning dobutamine as tolerated; consider alternative
   afterload reduction method (isosorbide mononitrate since renal failure
   exculdes acei)
   - amiodarone to keep atrial pacing going
   - continue UF for volume removal (goal -1-2L today)
   - will stop vanc, since groin lines removed. Monitro fever curve.
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   # Normocytic anemia:  Hct decreased to 24, likely following IABP
   removal, groin line removal and HD line placement.  Will transfuse
   today with goal of 30.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely IABP induced. HIT negative.  Stable,
   will continue to monitor, if it remains low over the next few days will
   work up alternative causes.
   # ARF: Creatinine much improved on UF. Expect etiology is contrast
   nephropathy from two caths and CT scan as well as hypotension in
   setting of cardiogeneic shock. Oligouric but shows some improvemen;
   will continue CVVH for neg fluid balance.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH
   # Rhythm: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension on admission and
   pace-maker induced tachycardia now resolved with increasing the PVARP.
   Currently with aflutter/fib rate controlled at 60-70 bpms with less
   pacemaker spikes
   - Heparin ggt
   - continue amiodarone
   - consulted EP regarding another attempt at pace termination and

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) for an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) complicated by posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation. The patient experienced cardiogenic shock and received intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, which was later discontinued without difficulty. Dopamine was weaned off, and dobutamine was continued at a dose of 6. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 95-96 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 99/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The physical examination revealed no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVD), a regular irregular heartbeat, normal first and second heart sounds, and a systolic murmur best heard at the apex. There were bilateral pitting edema and large hematoma on the left thigh.

Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 13.9 thousand/mm^3, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, platelet count of 79 thousand/mm^3, blood urea nitrogen (B"

   Remains oligouric; will continue CVVH for neg fluid balance.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH and try intermittent CVVH today so can
   get up to chair
   - will monitor uo and may require long term dialysis if remains low.
   # Rhythm: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension on admission and
   pace-maker induced tachycardia now resolved with increasing the PVARP.
   Currently with aflutter/fib.
   - Heparin ggt until procedures finished and then will have coumadin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease.
- She experienced an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery.
- The patient developed cardiogenic shock and mitral regurgitation due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia but does not have a flail leaflet.
- She is currently off pressors and has very low urine output, leading to ultrafiltration for volume removal.
- Repeat echocardiogram is being considered prior to discharge.
- Nitrate and hydralazine are started, and Coreg may be initiated if blood pressures allow. Lisinopril is held due to acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient has normocytic anemia, likely multifactorial in origin including hemolysis from intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and blood loss during procedures. Iron studies are ordered.
- Thrombocytopenia is present, most likely due to IABP-induced hemolysis and local hematomas from line removals. B12 and folate levels are being checked.
- ARF is suspected to be contrast nephropathy. Creatinine remains within normal limits on ultrafiltration. CVVH is continued for negative fluid balance, and intermittent CVVH is attempted today to allow the patient to sit up.
- Long-term dialysis may be required if"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # Cardiogenic shock/MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR
   but not a flail leaflet. Off pressors completely.
   - very low U/O so continue UF for volume removal (goal -1-2L today)
   - consider repeat echo prior to discharge
   - start nitrate and hydral today if able with blood pressures or
   possibly coreg as bp tolerates. Unable to start ACE because of ARF.
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   # Normocytic anemia:  Most likely multifactorial including hemolysis
   from IABP and blood loss during procedures. [**Month (only) 51**] also have chronic
   anemia as daughter reported yesterday was on procrit at home. Hct 30 p
   2pRBC yesterday.. Will clarify today. Iron studies today.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Plt dipped to 53. Most likely IABP induced but
   also a component of consumtive process in the setting of line removals
   and subsequent local hematoma. HIT negative.  Will check B12, folate.
   # ARF:Most likely contrast nephropathy. Creatinine remains wnl on UF.
   Remains oligouric; will continue CVVH for neg fluid balance.
   - follow up renal recs re: CVVH and try intermittent CVVH today so can
   get up to chair
   - will monitor uo and may require long term dialysis if remains low.
   # Rhythm: new onset afib now s/p DCCV for hypotension on admission and
   pace-maker induced tachycardia now resolved with increasing the PVARP.
   Currently with aflutter/fib.
   - Heparin ggt until procedures finished and then will have coumadin
   - continue amiodarone
   # Foot pain: suspect gout. Will cls with renal re:allopurinol dosing as
   may be able to receive more when on CVVH.
   - cte oxycodone for foot pain for now
   - up to chair today if able

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. The patient also had posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation but did not have a flail leaflet. She is currently in cardiogenic shock and experiencing congestive heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's history of heart failure and the presence of moderate mitral regurgitation indicate a risk for worsening heart failure.
3. Contrast Nephropathy: The patient may have developed contrast-induced nephropathy due to the recent contrast exposure during the PCI procedure. This can lead to acute kidney injury.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). The patient also has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and posterior papillary muscle ischemia but not a flail leaflet. She is currently in cardiogenic shock and off pressors. She has been oliguric with low urine output and is being considered for hemodialysis (HD) due to likely contrast nephropathy. Her platelet count is low, and she has been stable over the last few days. The patient is also experiencing thrombocytopenia and normocytic anemia. She is being treated with multiple medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, hydralazine, nitroglycerin, carvedilol, and amiodarone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's current condition indicates cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by inadequate blood flow to meet the body's needs. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Contrast nephropathy: The patient's recent exposure to contrast material during the PCI procedure may have caused acute kidney injury (AKI), resulting in reduced urine output and the need for hemodialysis.
3. Thrombocytopenia:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of renal failure and an acute myocardial infarction. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient has a history of allergies to cefazolin and previous antibiotic use. The patient's laboratory results indicate acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's pain, coping, skin integrity, renal function, and cardiac status are being assessed and managed in the ICU. The patient's nutritional needs are also being addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and fluid imbalances. This increases the risk of further renal deterioration and the need for ongoing dialysis support.
2. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has an acute myocardial infarction, which poses a risk of ongoing ischemia, arrhythmias, and cardiac dysfunction.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure"

   - very low U/O ; off CVVH [**12-31**] to low bp. Subsequently MAP 55-65. Will
   attempt to transition to HD.

   - consider repeat echo tomorrow to assess MR and need for repair
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   - Repeat TTE tomorrow to eval for MR severity
   # Diarrhea: Will follow up Cdiff cultures and start abx if necessary
   # Normocytic anemia:  Stable. Folate, B12 and Fe studies
   noncontributory to anemia. Will continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Has been stable over last days.
   # ARF:Most likely contrast nephropathy. Creatinine rose to 2.4 today
   and has had very minimal urine output. Since MAPs in 55-65 range of
   CVVH she may tolerate HD. Renal recs appreciated.  Remains oligouric.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior STEMI and was successfully treated with primary PCI to the mid-RCA. However, she developed cardiogenic shock and severe mitral regurgitation (MR) due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, oliguria, and an elevated creatinine level suggestive of acute kidney injury, likely contrast nephropathy. She is currently being managed with CVVH, medications for afterload reduction, and anticoagulation. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's severe MR and low cardiac output may lead to persistent cardiogenic shock, requiring continued support with inotropes and afterload reduction therapy.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria, elevated creatinine level, and previous exposure to contrast indicate a high risk of AKI. If her urine output does not improve, she may require long-term dialysis.

3. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has diarrhea, and there is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection. Appropriate antibiotic treatment should be initiated based on stool culture results.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, but it has been stable over the last few days. Monitoring for bleeding complications is essential, and further investigation"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # Cardiogenic shock/MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR
   but not a flail leaflet. Off pressors completely.
   - very low U/O ; off CVVH [**12-31**] to low bp. Subsequently MAP 55-65. Will
   attempt to transition to HD.
   - continue Hydral, nitro for afterload reduction given MR -> split up
   so doesn
t get them all at once
   - Hold coreg given doesn
t have good CO with low HRs and V-pacing
   - consider repeat echo tomorrow to assess MR and need for repair
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   - Repeat TTE tomorrow to eval for MR severity
   # Diarrhea: Will follow up Cdiff cultures and start abx if necessary
   # Normocytic anemia:  Stable. Folate, B12 and Fe studies
   noncontributory to anemia. Will continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Has been stable over last days.
   # ARF:Most likely contrast nephropathy. Creatinine rose to 2.4 today
   and has had very minimal urine output. Since MAPs in 55-65 range of
   CVVH she may tolerate HD. Renal recs appreciated.  Remains oligouric.
   Crn at baseline on admission 2.0
   - will monitor uo and may require long term dialysis if remains low.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI. She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) and now has posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock and is being managed with hemodynamic support. She also has diarrhea, normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF), atrial flutter/fibrillation, and gout. The patient is receiving multiple medications and is currently on cardiac diet, with glycemic control being monitored. She has a dialysis catheter in place and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's low blood pressure and signs of poor end-organ perfusion indicate cardiogenic shock. This is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate management to improve cardiac output and restore adequate blood flow to vital organs.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and minimal urine output suggest ARF. If left untreated, ARF can lead to further deterioration of renal function and may require long-term dialysis.
3. Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The patient has moderate MR, which can worsen over time if not"

The patient is currently in the ICU due to cardiogenic shock and moderate MR (mitral regurgitation) but not a flail leaflet. She is off pressors completely and has low urine output. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/57 mmHg to 112/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals bilateral pitting edema, no femoral bruits, large hematoma on the left thigh, and small hematoma on the right groin. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is receiving multiple medications including heparin, hydralazine, nitroprusside, carvedilol, aspirin, clopidogrel, and simvastatin. The plan includes continuing post-cath management with aspirin, clopidogrel, and simvastatin, transitioning to hemodialysis due to acute renal failure likely caused by contrast nephropathy, and monitoring for thrombocytopenia.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # Cardiogenic shock/MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR
   but not a flail leaflet. Off pressors completely.
   - very low U/O ; off CVVH [**12-31**] to low bp. Subsequently MAP 55-65. Will
   attempt to transition to HD.
   - continue Hydral, nitro for afterload reduction given MR -> split up
   so doesn
t get them all at once
   - Hold coreg given doesn
t have good CO with low HRs and V-pacing
   - consider repeat echo tomorrow to assess MR and need for repair
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   - Repeat TTE tomorrow to eval for MR severity
   # Diarrhea: Will follow up Cdiff cultures and start abx if necessary
   # Normocytic anemia:  Stable. Folate, B12 and Fe studies
   noncontributory to anemia. Will continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Has been stable over last days.
   # ARF:Most likely contrast nephropathy. Creatinine rose to 2.4 today
   and has had very minimal urine output. Since MAPs in 55-65 range of
   CVVH she may tolerate HD. Renal recs appreciated.  Remains oligouric.
   Crn at baseline on admission 2.0
   - will monitor uo and may require long term dialysis if remains low.
   -Will follow up renal recs
   # Rhythm: aflutter/fib
   - Heparin gtt
   - continue amiodarone, but change to 200mg QD for bradycardia as pt
   tolerates better when the patient is not V paced
   # Gout: Allopurinol QOD

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented to the ICU with cardiogenic shock and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) following a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She is currently off pressors, but her blood pressure remains low. She has been diagnosed with diarrhea, normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury (ARF) likely secondary to contrast nephropathy, atrial flutter/fibrillation, and gout. The patient is receiving various medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, hydralazine, nitroglycerin, amiodarone, and allopurinol. She is being managed with cardiac diet, glycemic control, prophylactic heparin and stress ulcer medication, and is on dialysis catheter. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she continues to have oliguria. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned to assess the severity of MR and the need for repair. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is currently in cardiogenic shock due to severe MR and posterior papillary muscle ischemia. There is a risk of worsening shock if the MR does not improve or if there is further"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yo woman with HTN HL CAD now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA for
   inferior STEMI complicated by posterior pap muscle ischemia and MR.
   # Cardiogenic shock/MR: Has posterior pap muscle ischemia and severe MR
   but not a flail leaflet. Off pressors completely.
   - very low U/O ; off CVVH [**12-31**] to low bp. Subsequently MAP 55-65. Will
   attempt to transition to HD.
   - continue Hydral, nitro for afterload reduction given MR -> split up
   so doesn
t get them all at once
   - Hold coreg given doesn
t have good CO with low HRs and V-pacing
   - consider repeat echo tomorrow to assess MR and need for repair
   # Inferior STEMI: now s/p primary PCI to the mid-RCA. Continuing post
   cath management with aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75 and simvastatin 80.
   - holding carvedilol, lisinopril
   - Repeat TTE tomorrow to eval for MR severity
   # Diarrhea: Will follow up Cdiff cultures and start abx if necessary
   # Normocytic anemia:  Stable. Folate, B12 and Fe studies
   noncontributory to anemia. Will continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Has been stable over last days.
   # ARF:Most likely contrast nephropathy. Creatinine rose to 2.4 today
   and has had very minimal urine output. Since MAPs in 55-65 range of
   CVVH she may tolerate HD. Renal recs appreciated.  Remains oligouric.
   Crn at baseline on admission 2.0
   - will monitor uo and may require long term dialysis if remains low.
   -Will follow up renal recs
   # Rhythm: aflutter/fib
   - Heparin gtt
   - continue amiodarone, but change to 200mg QD for bradycardia as pt
   tolerates better when the patient is not V paced

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery for inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) complicated by posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock/MR and has been off from renal replacement therapy (RRT) due to low blood pressure. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 84/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial flutter with a fluctuating heart rhythm. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. There are abnormalities in kidney function tests, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers. The blood glucose level is within normal range. 

The assessment and plan include treatment for cardiogenic shock/MR, inferior STEMI, diarrhea, normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF), rhythm disturbances, gout, and other ICU care. The patient's current medications include hydralazine, nitroglycerin, aspirin, clopid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who was admitted to the ICU for an inferior STEMI. She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) and subsequently developed cardiogenic shock and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia. The patient's vital signs have been unstable with low blood pressure and heart rate. She has had minimal urine output, leading to acute renal failure (ARF) likely caused by contrast nephropathy. Other medical conditions include normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, gout, and diarrhea, which has been ruled out as Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, hydralazine, nitroglycerin, and amiodarone. She is also receiving heparin infusion for anticoagulation. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and cardiac enzymes, along with electrolyte imbalances. An echocardiogram revealed severe MR but no flail leaflet. The patient's condition remains critical, and further interventions such as repeat echocardiogram, hemodialysis, and cardiac catheterization may be necessary. Potential medical complications include worsening MR, cardiac tamponade, ventricular arr"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI. She underwent primary PCI to the mid-RCA and was found to have posterior papillary muscle ischemia and severe mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock and is off all vasopressors. She has very low urine output and is not tolerating continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT). The renal team wants to wait before starting hemodialysis due to the patient's low blood pressure. The patient also has hyponatremia, likely due to fluid overload, and a negative Clostridium difficile test.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is a critical condition where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can lead to organ damage and failure if not promptly managed.

2. Severe Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The patient has severe MR, which can result in the accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and lead to respiratory distress and failure.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 3.0, indicating impaired kidney function. If not managed appropriately, this can progress to chronic renal failure.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient"

She also has severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia but does not have a flail leaflet. The patient has been experiencing cardiogenic shock and is currently off pressors completely. Her urine output has been very low, and she is off CVVH since her blood pressure is low. 

The patient's current medications include aspirin 325, clopidogrel 75, simvastatin 80, hydralazine, nitro for afterload reduction, allopurinol QOD, and pantoprazole 40mg daily. 

Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury (most likely contrast nephropathy), hyponatremia, and elevated troponin levels. 

Plan:
The patient will continue with post-cath management and continue to monitor her condition closely. She will likely require long-term dialysis due to acute renal failure. It is recommended to monitor her urine output and blood pressure during hemodialysis, aiming for a systolic blood pressure >90. Electrolyte levels will be monitored after hemodialysis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. She also has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia but does not have a flail leaflet. The patient was initially in cardiogenic shock and required vasopressors, but is now off them. She has a very low urine output and is no longer on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). Her blood pressure is stable with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) range of 55-65.

The patient has multiple medical complications including anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to contrast nephropathy, hyponatremia, and atrial fibrillation/flutter. She is being managed with various medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, hydralazine, nitroprusside, allopurinol, and amiodarone. The patient's sodium level improved after fluid removal with hemodialysis (HD). She has ongoing diarrhea, which was initially suspected to be Clostridium difficile infection but was later ruled out. The patient requires ongoing cardiac diet and glycemic control.

However, she developed cardiogenic shock and severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia. She has been off pressors completely but continues to have very low urine output. Her blood pressure is currently being managed with hydralazine and nitroglycerin for afterload reduction. 

The patient's recent events include experiencing transient loss of Dopplerable pulses in her left lower extremity, foot pain, paresthesias, and decreased sensation to light touch, which resolved spontaneously and returned with the use of a heating blanket. She tolerated hemodialysis well with 700 cc fluid removed and initiated a workup for outpatient dialysis. A plan for tunneled hemodialysis line placement is scheduled on [**3-26**], with heparin held for 3 hours prior. 

Her allergies include cefazolin, and she has a rash as a known side effect of antibiotics. Her current medications include heparin sodium, infusions of ICU medications, and other medications not specified.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of an inferior STEMI and underwent primary PCI to the mid-RCA. She also has severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior pap muscle ischemia but not a flail leaflet. The patient's current condition includes thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 38K, acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, diarrhea negative for C. difficile, and hyponatremia that has resolved. She is currently on cardiac diet, aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, and has been holding carvedilol and lisinopril. She is planned for tunnelled HD line placement today, but her platelet count needs to improve prior to the procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count (38K) increases the risk of bleeding, especially during invasive procedures like tunnelled HD line placement. Platelet transfusion is recommended prior to the procedure to prevent bleeding complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria. Continued monitoring of urine output and ongoing hemodialysis are necessary. There is a concern for contrast nephropathy, which may have contributed to the ARF.

","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted for an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). The patient also had posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).

The patient's current conditions include thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 38,000/uL, acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to contrast nephropathy, normocytic anemia, diarrhea (negative for Clostridium difficile twice), and hyponatremia which has resolved. The patient is also experiencing numbness in her left lower extremity.

The patient is currently on cardiac diet, receiving medications such as hydralazine, nitroglycerin for afterload reduction, aspirin, clopidogrel, and simvastatin. Carvedilol and lisinopril are being held.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening of thrombocytopenia, progression of ARF, development of further MR, and possible infections due to indwelling lines or catheters. Close monitoring of the patient's platelet count, renal function, and cardiac status is essential."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the hospital with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. Post-PCI, she developed mitral regurgitation due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia but does not have a flail leaflet. She is currently on hydralazine and nitroglycerin for afterload reduction given her MR. 

The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 38K, which is thought to be related to her previous balloon pump use. Her platelet count was previously improving but is now worsening. HIT is possible, but there is no evidence of peripheral thrombosis on examination. Differential diagnoses include immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Hematology consult is appreciated.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure (ARF), most likely contrast nephropathy. She tolerated hemodialysis (HD) well yesterday with 75 cc urine output (UOP). Work-up for outpatient hemodialysis has been initiated, and a plan for tunneled HD line placement today is in place. Platelets should be transfused prior to the procedure. 

The patient also has normocytic anemia with"

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and required hemodialysis due to acute renal failure, which is likely contrast nephropathy. She tolerated hemodialysis well and is planned for tunneled hemodialysis line placement today. Her platelet count decreased from 98K to 38K this morning, so platelet transfusion will be given prior to the procedure. The patient still has symptoms of diarrhea, and Clostridium difficile has been negative. Her normocytic anemia is stable, and she has thrombocytopenia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented to the hospital with symptoms of an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. The patient also has severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia but does not have a flail leaflet. She is currently on post-cath management with aspirin, clopidogrel, and simvastatin.

The patient has experienced several complications during her stay in the ICU. These include:
1. Loss of Dopplerable pulses in the left lower extremity (LLE) associated with foot pain, paresthesias, and decreased sensation to light touch. These symptoms resolved spontaneously, and the pulses returned with Doppler after heating the blanket.
2. Tolerated hemodialysis (HD) well with 700 cc fluid removal.
3. Initiated workup for outpatient HD; placed PPD.
4. Plan for tunneled HD line placement on [**3-26**], will need heparin held 3 hours prior.
5. Had foul-smelling stool output, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) sent.
6. Sodium levels improved from 127 to 137 within 10 hours after HD (no mental status change).
7. Thrombocytopenia with platelets decreasing from 98K"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of loss of dopplerable pulses in the left lower extremity, associated with foot pain, paresthesias, and decreased sensation to light touch. The symptoms resolved spontaneously, and pulses returned with the use of a heating blanket. The patient tolerated hemodialysis well with 700 cc fluid removal and had a Na level of 127 that increased to 137 within 10 hours. A foul-smelling stool output was also noted, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) was sent for testing. The patient has allergies to cefazolin, resulting in a rash. Heparin sodium is being infused at a rate of 500 units per hour. Other medications and ICU care are ongoing. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/44 to 75/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to limitations in peripheral vascular assessment. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, lactic acid, and liver enzymes. Other lab results are within normal limits. The patient's blood products and fluid balance are being monitored closely. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) for inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) complicated by posterior papillary muscle ischemia and mitral regurgitation (MR).
- The patient's platelet count decreased from 98K to 38K, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were ruled out. A heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) screen is pending, and heparin infusion has been discontinued.
- The patient received a transfusion of 1 bag of platelets, which improved her platelet count to 90K.
- A tunneled hemodialysis (HD) line was successfully placed.
- The patient experienced anxiety and shortness of breath overnight, which resolved with nebulized medication. There were no chest pains, congestive heart failure (CHF), or pressures reported.
- The patient reported pain at the HD catheter site. No diarrhea was reported overnight.
- The patient has allergies to cefazolin, with a rash as the last dose of antibiotics.
- The patient is currently receiving various medications, including hydralazine and isosorb"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. The patient also has severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia but no flail leaflet. She was initially improving but then experienced a decline in platelet count, which improved after platelet transfusion. The patient has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, and further workup is pending to rule out heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Her renal function is impaired, most likely due to contrast nephropathy, and she requires hemodialysis. The patient also has normocytic anemia, hyponatremia, and anxiety. She is currently on cardiac diet, anticoagulation therapy, antiplatelet agents, and medications for her various medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although she has experienced some fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. Her respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles at the lung bases and bilateral pitting edema. She has a stage I ulcer on her left lower extremity heel. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and kidney function.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA) for inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) complicated by posterior papillary muscle ischemia and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure (ARF), normocytic anemia, diarrhea, hyponatremia, and atrial fibrillation/flutter.

Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, with a recent decrease from 98K to 38K. Tests for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were negative. The patient received a transfusion of one bag of platelets, which improved her platelet count to 90K. HIT screen is pending, and heparin was discontinued.

ARF: The patient likely has contrast-induced nephropathy, and her renal function has been slow to improve despite ongoing oliguria. Outpatient hemodialysis was initiated, and a tunnelled hemodialysis line was successfully placed.

Normocytic anemia: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease who presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery (RCA). She also has mitral regurgitation due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia but does not have a flail leaflet. The patient's platelet count decreased from 98,000 to 38,000, and thrombocytopenia is suspected to be related to her previous balloon pump use. Other medical conditions include acute kidney injury (likely contrast nephropathy), normocytic anemia, diarrhea (negative for Clostridium difficile), hyponatremia, and atrial fibrillation/fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has significantly decreased, which can lead to increased bleeding risk. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

2. Contrast nephropathy: The patient has acute kidney injury, which may be due to contrast nephropathy from the recent cardiac catheterization. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of hemodialysis may be necessary.

3. Mitral regurgitation: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation secondary to posterior papillary muscle ischemia. This can result in volume overload and heart failure symptoms. Ongoing monitoring and potential medical or surgical"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She presented with an inferior STEMI and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. She also has severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia. The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, normocytic anemia, diarrhea, hyponatremia, and atrial fibrillation. She is currently in the ICU for ongoing management and monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, with a recent decrease from 98K to 38K. The cause of thrombocytopenia could be related to her history of balloon pump use or possibly HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). Further evaluation is needed, including repeat hep antibodies and monitoring of platelets.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is suspected to have contrast-induced nephropathy, which has resulted in ongoing oliguria. Outpatient hemodialysis has been initiated, and the patient now has a tunnelled HD line in place. Close monitoring of urine output is essential, along with continued hemodialysis.

3. Normocytic Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has stabilized at"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. She was admitted with an inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the mid-right coronary artery. She also has severe mitral regurgitation due to posterior papillary muscle ischemia but no flail leaflet. 

The patient has been experiencing thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count decreasing from 98,000 to 38,000. This could be related to her recent balloon pump use in the past. HIT is a possibility, but there is no evidence of peripheral thrombosis on examination. Other potential causes include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). A hematology consult has been requested for further evaluation. 

The patient's acute renal failure is most likely due to contrast nephropathy, but she has been slow to improve with ongoing oliguria. She tolerated hemodialysis (HD) well yesterday with 75 cc urine output. Outpatient hemodialysis work-up has been initiated, and a tunneled HD line will be placed today. 

The patient's normocytic anemia is stable with a hematocrit level of 29.2%. Fe studies have been unrevealing. Monitoring will continue for now. 

The patient still experiences diarrhea despite negative Clostridium difficile tests twice. The third stool sample will be checked, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels will be assessed. 

The patient's hyponatremia has resolved. 

The patient was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response but is now in atrial flutter/fibrillation. Anticoagulation will be continued after the thrombocytopenia workup is completed. 

The patient has a history of gout and will be started on allopurinol once daily. 

ICU care includes cardiac diet, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. 

The patient's code status is full code, and she will be called out to the floor today."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure and multi-organ dysfunction. She has a history of thrombocytopenia, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, impaired balance and gait, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, and ineffective coping. She also has chronic pain, anemia, impaired skin integrity, and a history of myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, with a recent decrease from 98K to 38K. This could lead to increased bleeding risks.
2. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) with Critical Limb Ischemia: The patient has impaired circulation in the lower extremities, which increases the risk of tissue damage and potential amputation.
3. Impaired Balance and Gait: The patient's impaired balance and gait may increase the risk of falls and injuries.
4. Impaired Muscle Performance: The patient's impaired muscle performance may affect her ability to move and perform activities of daily living.
5. Impaired Respiration/Gas Exchange: The patient's impaired respiration and gas exchange may result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
6. Ineffective Coping: The patient's ineffective coping mechanisms may contribute to psychological distress and decreased quality of life.
7. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase"
