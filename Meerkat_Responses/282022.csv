   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease presents
   from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s earlier today.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**]. Patient notes that he was doing all prescribed pulmonary
   hygiene, including inexsufflator and was at his baseline until early on
   day of [**Year (4 digits) **] when he felt acutely dyspneic and was noted to have an
   oxygen saturation in the 70s. (ED resident originally reported that
   patient's desaturation was measured on room air; however, patient
   cannot corraborate this information. Patient was discharged with
   instructions to remain on 4L supplemental oxygen at all times.)
   .
   Upon presentation to the ED: T 100.1, HR 76, BP 114/74, RR 22, O2Sat
   100% NRB. Patient was assessed as having a worsened CXR and was given
   prednisone 60 mg, albuterol and ipratropium neb, acetaminophen, Zosyn,
   and tobramycin. Vitals prior to transfer to the ICU were: HR 84, BP
   112/71, RR 14, O2Sat 98% NRB.

   STUDIES:
   .
   CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2124-10-14**]:
   IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study. There has been interval
   opacification of the retrocardiac left lower lung which is presumably
   in part due to atelectasis and large effusion although a concurrent
   pneumonia cannot be excluded. Mild edema.
   .
   In [**Location (un) 308**] prior discharge summary from [**2124-7-6**], discovered that
   patient had profuse bleeding while on full anticoagulation with
   lovenox, thus has been on reduced dose of 40 mg Q12H since that time

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease presents
   from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s earlier today.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**].
   #. Hypoxia:
   Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and with multiple
   respiratory pahtogens in recent past. Most likely that patient
   developed a healthcare associated pneumonia given his recent prolonged
   hospitalizations. Last course of antibiotics for HAP was [**2124-9-28**] to
   [**2124-10-5**]. Possible that patient has developed resistance to this
   regimenn, though will treat empirically on past culture data until new
   sputum or BAL samples direct treatment. Aside from an uncomplicated
   bacterial pneumonia, possible that there is an associated pleural
   effusion given new CXR obtained in the ED. Rotation and positioning
   make intepretation difficult, so additional imaging with CT is
   reasonable. Must additionally give consideration to organisms likely to
   infect immunocompromised hosts; however, patient has been on
   prophylaxis with acyclovir, bactrim, voriconazole, and tobramycin.
   After initial treatment for baterial pneumonia and advanced imaging
   with CT, may need to consider BAL for collection of sample to guide
   treatment. As a final point, patient noted by nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to be
   without gag reflex and coughed after drinking water, despite multiple
   prior S/S evals, prudent to have patient screened again given poor
   pulmonary reserve and multiple [**Last Name (Titles) **] for hypoxia.
   - CT chest with contrast to determine if new CXR findings are
   atelectasis vs pneumonia vs effusion or some combination of several
   pathologies
   - Cover for healthcare associated pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn
   (zosyn chosen with regard to prior sensitivities)
   - Continue prednisone 30 mg daily
   - Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive
   spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction
   - Sputum culture
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Follow-up influenza screen from ED, though no need to further treat
   with oseltamivir given recent 7 day course from [**2124-10-2**] to
   [**2124-10-8**]
   - Possible need for bronch with BAL to direct treatment as above
   - Speech and swallow consult
   - NPO except medications until formal S/S eval
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:
   At previous [**Year (4 digits) **] patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60
   mg daily and had been titrated down to 30 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue prednisone at 30 mg daily and reassess prior to planned
   taper down to 20 mg daily on [**2124-10-19**].
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain:
   Thought to be attributable to GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   Question if chronic respiratory acidosis related to large doses of
   opiates causing respiratory drive suppression and subsequent
   hypoventilation. Patient reporting [**3-26**] pain in abdomen and back at
   presentation.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:
   Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events. Has been on enoxaparin
   40 mg Q12H for many months; however, a therapeutic dose of enoxaparin
   for this 70 kg gentleman would be 70 mg Q12H.
   - Research records to assess why on enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease presents
   from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s earlier today.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**].
   #. Hypoxia:
   Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and with multiple
   respiratory pahtogens in recent past. The patient may have developed a
   healthcare associated pneumonia given his recent prolonged
   hospitalizations.  On CT, there is collapse of nearly entire LLL and
   some of RLL as well as persistent pleural effusions. No evidence of
   obstruction by mucous plug, so bronch is not likely to be helpful in
   this case.
   - Cover for healthcare associated pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn
   (zosyn chosen with regard to prior sensitivities).  Day 2 of a 8 day
   course.
   - Continue prednisone 30 mg daily
   - Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive
   spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction
   - Try to obtain Sputum culture
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Follow-up influenza screen from ED, though no need to further treat
   with oseltamivir given recent 7 day course from [**2124-10-2**] to
   [**2124-10-8**]
   - Speech and swallow consult
   - NPO except medications until formal S/S eval
   .
   #Fever: In [**Name (NI) **], pt. with low grade fever of 100.1F, could represent
   atelectasis vs. HAP vs. cellulitis on LE given erythema and warmth
   -Will continue empiric treatment with Vanc and Zosyn as above
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   -f/u Blood cultures
   .
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:
   At previous admission patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60
   mg daily and had been titrated down to 30 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue prednisone at 30 mg daily and reassess prior to planned
   taper down to 20 mg daily on [**2124-10-19**].
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain:
   Thought to be attributable to GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   #. Hx of PE, DVT:
   Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant and complicating graft versus host disease. He presents from rehab following an episode of hypoxia in the 70s earlier today. The patient has multiple respiratory pathogens in his recent past and may have developed a healthcare-associated pneumonia given his recent prolonged hospitalizations. The CT scan shows collapse of nearly the entire left lower lobe (LLL) and some of the right lower lobe (RLL), along with persistent pleural effusions. There is no evidence of obstruction by mucous plug, so bronchial suctioning is not likely to be helpful in this case.

The patient is currently being covered for healthcare-associated pneumonia with vancomycin and Zosyn (Zosyn chosen with regard to prior sensitivities). This is day 2 of an 8-day course. The patient is also on prednisone 30 mg daily for his chronic GVHD. Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction, obtaining sputum culture, follow-up blood cultures, and a speech and swallow consult have been ordered.

The patient's fever of 100.1F could represent atelectasis versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) versus cellulitis on the lower extremity given erythema and warmth. He will continue"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with significant history of CML--s/p BMT and now with recent
   admission with pneumonia and significant challenges in regards to
   maintenance of clearance of secretions with weakness and chest wall
   restriction/splinting with significant pain noted.  He did have recent
   discharge to rehab and was well informed, well skilled and compliant
   with interventions but now has had significant episode of hypoxemia
   noted with desaturation to 70% on room air and then was returned to [**Location **]
   for evaluation.  Patient given prednisone, Zosyn and Tobramycin and
   admit to ICU in the setting of new left sided opacity on CXR.
   1) HYPOXEMIA--This is most concerning for evidence of recurrent
   collapse in left lung which may be related to recurrent mucus plugging
   in the setting of significant background hypoxemia.  This is in the
   absence of significant evidence of new overwhelming infection as
   significant fever, hypotension, tachycardia have not accompanied
   presentation but this certainly may be partially treated infection and
   vigilance is to be maintained for this possibility.
   -Continue with MIE if able to assist patient with cough.
   -Continue with flutter valve for support
   -Continue with Tobramycin inhaled
   -Vanco/Zosyn to continue
   -Acyclovir
   -Did re-mention tracheostomy and this will have to be considered with
   recurrent hospitalizations needed as it may help with suctioning and
   cough but will have to consider risks
   -Speech and swallow to aid in evaluation and treatment in regards to
   aspiration risk
   -Will need to obtain sputum sample for culture based upon suctioning
   2)CML-GVHD
   -Mycophenilate Mofetil 250/500
   -Pred 30mg qd
   -Bactrim po qd
   3)Pain Control-
   -Lyrica/Methadone/Fentanyl Patch/Lidocaine Patch
   4)Cellulitis-Will need to follow exam, may be contributing to fever
   going forward
   -Vancomycin/Zosyn
   -Will need to consider antibiotic intervention based upon blood culture
   results going forward
   -Will have to consider ID consult for any expansion of area of
   involvement as this does represent reasonably complete coverage at this
   time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a significant history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and bone marrow transplant (BMT). He was admitted with recurrent and persistent hypoxemia in the setting of recent infection. The patient had a previous discharge to rehab and was well informed, skilled, and compliant with interventions. However, he experienced a significant episode of hypoxemia with desaturation to 70% on room air, leading to his return to the ICU for evaluation. 

The patient has been given prednisone, Zosyn, and Tobramycin. His current assessment includes hypoxemia, which is concerning for recurrent collapse in the left lung possibly related to mucus plugging. There is also evidence of bilateral erythema and warmth, indicating possible cellulitis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/55 to 117/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His blood work shows anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging shows worsening left-sided opacities on chest X-ray.

Plan:
1. Continue with mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE) if able to assist patient with cough.
2. Continue with flutter valve support.
3. Continue with"

   from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s earlier today.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**].
   #. Hypoxia:
   Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and with multiple
   respiratory pahtogens in recent past. The patient may have developed a
   healthcare associated pneumonia given his recent prolonged
   hospitalizations.  On CT, there is collapse of nearly entire LLL and
   some of RLL as well as persistent pleural effusions. No evidence of
   obstruction by mucous plug, so bronch is not likely to be helpful in
   this case.  Recent 7 day course of tamiflu from [**2124-10-2**] to
   [**2124-10-8**]
   - Cover for healthcare associated pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn
   (zosyn chosen with regard to prior sensitivities).  Day 3 of a 8 day
   course.
   - Continue prednisone 30 mg daily
   - Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive

   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:
   At previous admission patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60
   mg daily and had been titrated down to 30 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue prednisone at 30 mg daily and reassess prior to planned

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant and complicating graft versus host disease. He presents from rehab following an episode of hypoxia earlier today. The patient has impaired skin integrity, pain control issues, hypoxemia, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient may have developed a healthcare-associated pneumonia due to his recent prolonged hospitalizations. He also has underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and multiple respiratory pathogens in the recent past. The CT scan shows collapse of the entire left lower lobe (LLL) and some of the right lower lobe (RLL), along with persistent pleural effusions. There is no evidence of obstruction by mucous plug, so bronchoscopic intervention may not be helpful in this case.

2. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP): The patient's recent prolonged hospitalizations and the presence of collapse in the LLL and RLL on CT scan suggest the possibility of HCAP. The patient is currently on a 7-day course of Tamiflu, and empirical treatment with vancomycin and zosyn is being continued.

3. Fever: The patient had a low-grade fever of 100.1F, which could represent atelectasis, healthcare-associated pneumonia, or cellulitis on the left lower extremity given the erythema and warmth. The white"

   from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s earlier today.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**].
   #. Hypoxia:
   Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and with multiple
   respiratory pahtogens in recent past. The patient may have developed a
   healthcare associated pneumonia given his recent prolonged
   hospitalizations.  On CT, there is collapse of nearly entire LLL and
   some of RLL as well as persistent pleural effusions. No evidence of
   obstruction by mucous plug, so bronch is not likely to be helpful in
   this case.  Recent 7 day course of tamiflu from [**2124-10-2**] to
   [**2124-10-8**]
   - Cover for healthcare associated pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn
   (zosyn chosen with regard to prior sensitivities).  Day 3 of a 8 day

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and graft versus host disease (GVHD) who presents with impaired skin integrity, pain control, hypoxemia, fever, and chronic GVHD. The patient was discharged from the ICU to a high-level rehab facility on October 11th, 2024.

The patient has underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and multiple respiratory pathogens in the recent past. He may have developed a healthcare-associated pneumonia given his recent prolonged hospitalizations. On CT, there is collapse of nearly the entire left lower lobe (LLL) and some of the right lower lobe (RLL) as well as persistent pleural effusions. No evidence of obstruction by mucous plug, so bronchoscopy is not likely to be helpful in this case.

The patient is currently on a 7-day course of tamiflu from October 2nd to October 8th. Cover for healthcare-associated pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn (zosyn chosen with regard to prior sensitivities). Day 3 of an 8-day course. The patient is also on prednisone 30 mg daily, pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction, and follow-up sputum culture.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with allogeneic stem cell transplant and complicated graft versus host disease (GVHD). He presents from rehab following an episode of hypoxia in the 70s earlier today. The patient was discharged from the ICU to the high-level rehab facility on [**2124-10-11**].

Assessment and Plan:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has pain and erythema on the lower extremities, which may indicate impaired skin integrity. This could be due to GVHD or other causes.
2. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which needs to be managed appropriately.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and previous respiratory pathogens. He may have developed a healthcare-associated pneumonia given his recent prolonged hospitalizations. A CT scan shows collapse of nearly the entire left lower lobe (LLL) and some right lower lobe (RLL) as well as persistent pleural effusions. No evidence of obstruction by mucous plug, so bronchoscopic intervention is not likely to be helpful in this case.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with severe respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive lung disease and impaired chest wall function. He has been receiving extensive respiratory support. There is no clear evidence of proximal airway obstruction that would warrant mechanical intervention to promote airspace patency.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1) Respiratory Failure: The patient does not show signs of active significant infection or exacerbation of underlying lung disease upon return from rehab. Adequate support is needed for clearing secretions going forward. The treatment plan includes Vancomycin, Tobramycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Budesonide, Prednisone, and Bactrim DS.

2) GVHD: The patient requires treatment for graft-versus-host disease, including Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and Acyclovir.

3) Pain Control: The patient's pain needs to be managed with medications such as Methadone, Lidocaine, and Fentanyl.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1) Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores.

2) Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation level (SpO2: 88%) indicates hypoxemia, which could lead to further respiratory complications.

3) Infection: The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and the presence of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with severe respiratory failure, chronic obstructive lung disease, and significant impairment in chest wall function. He has been receiving extensive respiratory support. There is no evidence of active significant infection or exacerbation of underlying lung disease upon return from rehab. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/65 to 136/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes and diminished breath sounds, along with soft and distended abdomen. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. Imaging shows no evidence of recurrent collapse on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe respiratory compromise and impaired chest wall function may lead to ongoing respiratory failure. Continuous respiratory support will be needed.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count could indicate an underlying infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is crucial.
3. Exacerbation of Underlying Lung Disease: The patient's chronic obstructive lung disease may worsen due to the current respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of his lung condition are necessary.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity appears to be compromised. Regular assessment and appropriate wound care are"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**].
   #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and
   with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Currently treating
   for HAP.  Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.  No evidence of
   mucous plug obstruction.
   -- Continue HAP coverage with Vanc and Zosyn due to prior
   sensitivities, now on 4 of an 8 day course. (Vanc needs ID approval
   today)
   - Continue prednisone 30 mg daily until [**2124-10-19**], then 20mg daily after
   reassessment
   - Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive
   spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction today; MIE being brought over
   - F/u final sputum cx, viral cx
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Will have discussion with patient and family regarding goals of care
   because if he decompensates and needs intubation, it is very likely
   that he would need subsequent trach which he does not want
   - Will need deep suctioning and to be on oxygen at LTACH when
   discharged
   #. Fever: In [**Name (NI) **], pt. with low grade fever of 100.1F, could represent
   atelectasis vs. HAP vs. cellulitis on LE given erythema and warmth.
   WBC stable and remains afebrile.
   -Will continue empiric treatment with Vanc and Zosyn as above
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   - F/u Blood cultures
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 30 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue prednisone at 30 mg daily and reassess prior to planned
   taper down to 20 mg daily on [**2124-10-19**].
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant and complicating graft versus host disease (GVHD). The patient presented from rehab with an episode of hypoxia in the 70s. He was discharged from the ICU to a high-level rehab facility on [**2124-10-11**].

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's initial presentation was an episode of hypoxia, which could be due to bronchiolitis related to GVHD and previous respiratory infections. The patient is currently being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). It is important to monitor the patient's oxygen levels and continue appropriate respiratory support if needed.

2. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever of 100.1F, which could represent atelectasis, HAP, or cellulitis on the lower extremity given the erythema and warmth. The patient is already on empiric treatment with Vanc and Zosyn. Close monitoring of the fever curve and trending WBC counts are necessary. Follow-up blood cultures should also be obtained.

3. Chronic GVHD: The patient has a history of CML post-bone marrow transplants complicated by chronic GV"

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who has been readmitted to the ICU with recurrent hypoxemia. The patient has chronic respiratory compromise due to COPD and chest wall restriction, as well as underlying bronchiolitis. The patient is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, prednisone, inhaled tobramycin, albuterol, cellcept, bactrim prophylaxis, and pain management medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Hypoxemia: The patient's chronic respiratory compromise, underlying bronchiolitis, and COPD increase the risk of recurrent hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
2. GVHD: Although the patient's GVHD appears to be well-controlled, there is still a risk of complications associated with this condition, such as liver dysfunction or gastrointestinal issues.
3. Pain: The patient's pain from compression fractures needs to be managed appropriately to ensure comfort and prevent further complications.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: There is a risk of skin breakdown or pressure ulcers due to the patient's prolonged bed rest and limited mobility.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state increases the risk of infections, particularly pneumonia given his respiratory symptoms and underlying bronchiolitis.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis"

   #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and
   with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Currently treating
   for HAP.  Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.  No evidence of
   mucous plug obstruction.
   -- Continue HAP coverage with Vanc and Zosyn due to prior
   sensitivities, now on 5 of an 8 day course.

   - Will have discussion with patient and family regarding goals of care
   because if he decompensates and needs intubation, it is very likely
   that he would need subsequent trach which he does not want
   - address question of possible trach for improved ventilation at night
   - Will need deep suctioning and to be on oxygen at LTACH when
   discharged

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with allogeneic stem cell transplant and complicating graft versus host disease (GVHD). He presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia in the 70s. The patient was discharged from the ICU to the high-level rehab facility on [2124-10-11]. He has several medical conditions including hypoxia, bronchiolitis related to GVHD, multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past, and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He also has fever, erythema, and warmth in the lower extremities, which could represent atelectasis, HAP, or cellulitis. Additionally, the patient has chronic GVHD and previous thrombotic events.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and previous respiratory pathogens can lead to persistent hypoxia. HAP coverage with Vancomycin (Vanc) and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) should be continued due to prior sensitivities.
2. Fever: The patient's low-grade fever could be due to atelectasis, HAP, or cellulitis on the lower extremities. Empiric treatment with Vanc and Zosyn should be continued, and blood cultures should be followed up.
3. Chronic GVHD: The patient has ongoing symptoms of chronic GV"

   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**].
   #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and
   with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Currently treating
   for HAP.  Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.  No evidence of
   mucous plug obstruction.
   -- Continue HAP coverage with Vanc and Zosyn due to prior
   sensitivities, now on 5 of an 8 day course.
   - Continue prednisone 30 mg daily until [**2124-10-19**], then 20mg daily after
   reassessment
   - Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive
   spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction today; MIE being brought over
   - F/u final sputum cx, viral cx
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Will have discussion with patient and family regarding goals of care
   because if he decompensates and needs intubation, it is very likely
   that he would need subsequent trach which he does not want
   - Will need deep suctioning and to be on oxygen at LTACH when
   discharged
   #. Fever: In [**Name (NI) **], pt. with low grade fever of 100.1F, could represent
   atelectasis vs. HAP vs. cellulitis on LE given erythema and warmth.
   WBC stable and remains afebrile.
   -Will continue empiric treatment with Vanc and Zosyn as above
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves

   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 30 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue prednisone at 30 mg daily and reassess prior to planned
   taper down to 20 mg daily on [**2124-10-19**].
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with labored breathing and abdominal pain. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, pain medication, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, wheezes on respiratory examination, and edema in both lower extremities. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 194 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 200 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile is within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's labored breathing and wheezing suggest possible respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The presence of bilateral lower extremity edema raises concern for DVT, which is being prophylaxed with enoxaparin (lovenox).
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and presence of abdominal pain may indicate an underlying infection, potentially leading to seps"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and persistent significant respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is attributed to obstructive lung disease, chest wall restriction with vertebral fractures and kyphosis. There is no evidence of ongoing active infection at this time, but there is a small area of left lower lobe (LLL) collapse that persists. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/64 mmHg to 129/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 69.3 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,060 mL and output of 1,390 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 670 mL. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin), pain control medications (Lyrica, Fentanyl, Lidocaine), and GVHD prophylaxis (Prednisone, Cellcept). The patient's lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 194 K/uL, slightly low platelet count of 109 mg/dL, normal sodium and potassium levels, and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 200 mg/dL to 109"

 HYPOXEMIA
   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**].
    #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and
   with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Currently treating
   for HAP.  Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.  No evidence of
   mucous plug obstruction.
   -- Continue HAP coverage with Vanc and Zosyn due to prior
   sensitivities, now on 6 of an 8 day course.
   - Continue prednisone 30 mg daily until [**2124-10-19**], then 20mg daily after
   reassessment.  Given that he is still not able to be weaned to bipap,
   consider keeping at this dose.
   - Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive
   spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction daily
   - Trial of Bipap at 10/5 today; has used in the past with favorable
   response
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Per outpatient pulmonologist, trach is unlikely to improve his
   functional status and may worsen his ability to cough; will hold off on
   trach unless patient needs to be intubated
   - Will need deep suctioning and to be on oxygen at LTACH when
   discharged
   #. Fever: In [**Name (NI) **], pt. with low grade fever of 100.1F, could represent
   atelectasis vs. HAP vs. cellulitis on LE given erythema and warmth.
   WBC stable and remains afebrile.
   -Will continue empiric treatment with Vanc and Zosyn as above
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   - F/u Blood cultures
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 30 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue prednisone at 30 mg daily and reassess prior to planned
   taper down to 20 mg daily on [**2124-10-19**].
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2121**] and developed graft versus host disease (GVHD). He presented from rehab after experiencing hypoxia in the 70s. The patient was discharged from the ICU to a high-level rehab facility on [**2124-10-11**].

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient has underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and multiple respiratory pathogens in the recent past. He is currently being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has left lower lobe (LLL) collapse and some right lower lobe (RLL) collapse on CT, but there is no evidence of mucous plug obstruction. To continue HAP coverage with Vancomycin and Zosyn due to prior sensitivities, the patient is on a 6 of an 8-day course. Prednisone is being continued at 30 mg daily until [**2124-10-19**], then 20 mg daily after reassessment. Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive spirometry, acapella valve, and deep suctioning daily will be maintained. A trial of Bipap at 10/5 today will be attempted, as the patient has used it in the past with favorable response.

   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**].
    #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and
   with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Currently treating
   for HAP.  Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.  No evidence of
   mucous plug obstruction.
   -- Continue HAP coverage with Vanc and Zosyn due to prior
   sensitivities, now on 6 of an 8 day course.
   - Continue prednisone 30 mg daily until [**2124-10-19**], then 20mg daily after
   reassessment.  Given that he is still not able to be weaned to bipap,
   kept at this dose with daily reassessment.
   - Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive
   spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction daily
   - Trial of Bipap at 10/5 today; has used in the past with favorable
   response
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Per outpatient pulmonologist, trach is unlikely to improve his
   functional status and may worsen his ability to cough; will hold off on
   trach unless patient needs to be intubated
   - Will need deep suctioning and to be on oxygen at LTACH when
   discharged
   - possible to try bipap later today depending on pulmonary status
   #. Fever: In [**Name (NI) **], pt. with low grade fever of 100.1F, could represent
   atelectasis vs. HAP vs. cellulitis on LE given erythema and warmth.
   WBC stable and remains afebrile.
   -Will continue empiric treatment with Vanc and Zosyn as above
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   - F/u Blood cultures
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 30 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue prednisone at 30 mg daily and reassess prior to planned
   taper down to 20 mg daily on [**2124-10-19**].
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with CML and significant obstructive lung disease with OB
   and now with hypercarbic respiratory failure with complications of
   spinal fractures and now with persistent hypercarbia.  His recent
   course has been complicated by significant secretions and with focus on
   strategies for clearance are significant at this time.  We have had a
   trial of BIPAP which was limited by hypoxia and we do have ongoing
   concerns as relates to [**Hospital1 **]-LEVEL mask ventilation having a significant
   negative impact on patient's secretion clearance which would have a
   substantial chance of contributing to respiratory failure.  At this
   time [**Hospital1 **]-level has not succeeded.  We are left with suctioning and
   flutter valve and MIE to provide facility in clearance.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue with nasal-tracheal suctioning
   -Alb/Atrovent inhaler
   -Flutter Valve
   -Will hold on BIPAP given increase in secretion clearance and hypoxemia
   yesterday
will re-trial with secretions decreased
   -Will screen for possible rehab placement and keep in ICU for now

   -Fentanyl
   -Lidocaine
   -MSO4
   -Lyrica
   -Methadone
   3)GVHD-

    #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and
   with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Currently treating
   for HAP.  Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.  No evidence of
   mucous plug obstruction.
   -- Covered  HAP coverage with Vanc and Zosyn due to prior
   sensitivities, finished 8 day course.  D/c now.
   - - Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive
   spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction daily
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Per outpatient pulmonologist, trach is unlikely to improve his
   functional status and may worsen his ability to cough; will hold off on
   trach unless patient needs to be intubated
   - Will need deep suctioning and to be on oxygen at LTACH when
   discharged
   #. Fever: In [**Name (NI) **], pt. with low grade fever of 100.1F, could represent
   atelectasis vs. HAP vs. cellulitis on LE given erythema and warmth.
   WBC stable and remains afebrile.
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   - F/u Blood cultures
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 30 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - decreased Prednisone to 20mg today
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin

   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**].
    #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and
   with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Currently treating
   for HAP.  Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.  No evidence of
   mucous plug obstruction.
   -- Continue HAP coverage with Vanc and Zosyn due to prior
   sensitivities, now on 7 of an 8 day course.
   - Consider decrease prednisone to 20mg daily.
   - Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive
   spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction daily
   - Trial of Bipap at 10/5 today; has used in the past with favorable
   response
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - Per outpatient pulmonologist, trach is unlikely to improve his
   functional status and may worsen his ability to cough; will hold off on
   trach unless patient needs to be intubated
   - Will need deep suctioning and to be on oxygen at LTACH when
   discharged
   #. Fever: In [**Name (NI) **], pt. with low grade fever of 100.1F, could represent
   atelectasis vs. HAP vs. cellulitis on LE given erythema and warmth.
   WBC stable and remains afebrile.
   -Will continue empiric treatment with Vanc and Zosyn as above
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   - F/u Blood cultures
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 30 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - decrease Prednisone to 20mg today
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease (GVHD). The patient presented from rehab with an episode of hypoxia in the 70s. He was discharged from the ICU to a high-level rehab facility on [**2124-10-11**].

The patient's current conditions include impaired skin integrity, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), and hypoxemia. He has underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and multiple respiratory pathogens in the recent past. The patient is currently being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and has left lower lobe collapse and some right lower lobe collapse on CT. There is no evidence of mucous plug obstruction.

The plan includes continuing HAP coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam due to prior sensitivities, now on a 7-day course. Considering a decrease in prednisone dosage to 20 mg daily. Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive spirometry, acapella valve, and deep suctioning daily.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   24 Hour Events:
   -BIPAP at 10/5 and desaturation to 84%--he had decrease to this quite
   rapidly despite increase in O2 flow rate to 5 liters at the time of
   initiation of [**Hospital1 **]-level support.  He was 96% prior to intervention.
   This would argue that patient has significant evolution of zone 1
   physiology and preferential shunt to underventilated areas at the
   bases.  There was some concern about the fact that effective FIO2 is
   going to be less with [**Hospital1 **]-level device and we could consider move to
   non-invasive mask ventilation but with the physiologic response seen
   above it is almost certain the Vd/Vt was increased at the time of
   application of the positive pressure.  Additionally this may be
   contributed to by mucus plugging distally.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of obstructive lung disease, undergoing outpatient bronchial lavage (BAL) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) post bone marrow transplant (BMT) for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The patient has significant chest wall restriction due to vertebral fractures and pain. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure.

24-hour events:
- The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) decreased to 84% despite increased oxygen flow rate during the initiation of BIPAP (bi-level positive airway pressure) therapy. Prior to intervention, the patient's SpO2 was 96%. This suggests significant zone 1 physiology and preferential shunt to underventilated areas at the bases. There were concerns about the effectiveness of FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) with the hospital-level device, and the possibility of moving to non-invasive mask ventilation was considered.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/59 mmHg to 141/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 91%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant in 2021 and complicating graft versus host disease (GVHD). He presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia in the 70s. The patient was discharged from the ICU to a high-level rehab facility on October 11, 2024.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and has had multiple respiratory pathogens in the recent past. Currently, he is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He has left lower lobe collapse and some right lower lobe collapse on CT, but no evidence of mucous plug obstruction. Coverage for HAP with Vancomycin and Zosyn was stopped yesterday. Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive spirometry, acapella valve, and deep suctioning daily will be continued. The outpatient pulmonologist does not recommend tracheostomy as it may worsen his ability to cough and will only consider it if the patient needs to be intubated. The patient will require deep suctioning and oxygen at the long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) when discharged.
2. Fever: The patient had a low-grade fever of 100.1F, which could represent atelectasis, HAP, or cellulitis on the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2121**] and developed graft versus host disease (GVHD).
- The patient presented from rehab with an episode of hypoxia and was discharged from the ICU to a high-level rehab facility on [**2124-10-11**]. He was readmitted with hypoxia.
- The patient has impaired skin integrity, pain control (acute and chronic pain), and hypoxemia.
- He has a history of CML treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant and complicating GVHD.
- The patient's current condition includes hypoxia due to underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and previous respiratory pathogens. He has left lower lobe (LLL) collapse and right lower lobe (RLL) collapse on computed tomography (CT), but no evidence of mucous plug obstruction.
- The patient finished a course of antibiotics and is undergoing pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive spirometry, acapella valve, and deep suctioning daily.
- The outpatient pulmonologist believes that tracheostomy may worsen the patient's ability to cough and is holding off on it unless the patient needs to be intubated.
- The patient also has a low-grade fever of 100.1°F, which could represent atelectasis, healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), or cellulitis on the lower extremity given the erythema and warmth.
- His WBC count is stable, and he remains afebrile.
- Trend WBC counts and fever curves, and follow-up blood cultures are planned.
- The patient is being treated for chronic GVHD with prednisone taper and mycophenolate mofetil. Prophylaxis with Bactrim, voriconazole, and tobramycin is also being continued.
- The patient is on enoxaparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- He continues to experience chronic abdominal pain and back pain, which are thought to be attributable to GVHD after a negative prior work-up.
- The patient's pain management regimen includes fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches, and pregabalin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's underlying bronchiolitis and previous respiratory pathogens may lead to persistent hypoxemia.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of infection and delayed wound healing.
3. Chronic Pain: The patient's chronic abdominal pain and back pain may hinder his recovery and increase the risk of complications related to immobility.
4. GVHD: The patient's history of GVHD may lead to ongoing inflammation and damage to organs such as the lungs, abdomen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive lung disease, undergoing bone marrow transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia. He has been experiencing respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes GVHD (graft-versus-host disease), bronchiectasis, and recurrent respiratory infections. He has been on mechanical ventilation but has shown poor tolerance to BiPAP (non-invasive positive airway pressure). The patient's current condition includes severe pain due to vertebral fractures, extensive skin tears, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern and can lead to further deterioration in his oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring and aggressive management of his respiratory status are crucial.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to bone marrow transplantation and GVHD increases his risk of developing infections. Proper infection control measures and vigilant monitoring for any signs of infection are essential.
3. Pain Management: The patient's severe pain needs to be addressed promptly to improve his comfort and overall well-being. Adequate analgesia should be provided to manage both acute and chronic pain.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's extensive skin tears and impaired skin integrity put him at risk for skin breakdown and potential infections. Proper wound care and regular assessment of the skin are necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with significant obstructive lung disease, obstructive bronchiolitis (OB) with graft versus host disease (GVHD) following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). He also has chest wall restriction due to vertebral fractures and pain. The patient is currently managed with frequent suctioning and chest physiotherapy limited to flutter valve due to good tolerance. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or BiPAP has not been successful.

The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure and bronchiectasis. He has been weaned from nasal rapid flow (NRB) to nasal cannula (NC) and looks at his poor baseline on standing tobramycin nebulizers for pseudomonas suppression. The patient experienced a significant oxygen desaturation event on 12/20 and failed the trial of BiPAP. He was supposed to be transferred to the oncology floor yesterday but was unable to do so due to the desaturation event. Today, the patient has lower oxygen saturation (sats) and higher oxygen requirements, possibly due to a plug. He is currently on home prophylactic antibiotics including bactrim, [Doctor First Name] nebs, and voriconazole. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 118/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His general appearance is no acute distress, ill-appearing, severe kyphosis. Physical examination findings include normal eye and conjunctiva, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds, difficult to auscultate due to loud rhonchorous lung sounds, no significant edema in extremities, warm skin with extensive skin tears, and attentive neurologic status.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.4 K/uL, hematocrit of 28.7%, platelet count of 94 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide of 46 mmol/L, blood glucose of 200 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal ranges. Other lab results including PT/PTT/INR, differential, lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and fluid analysis are provided.

The patient's medical issues include impaired skin integrity, pain control (acute and chronic pain), and hypoxemia. The plan includes increasing the use of incentive spirometry and flutter valve, needs suction [Hospital1], and addressing other issues per resident note on 10/21. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (PICC line), prophylaxis (DVT and stress ulcer), and comments regarding communication, code status, and disposition."

   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**] and then readmitted with hypoxia.
    #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and
   with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Has LLL collapse
   and some RLL collapse on CT.  No evidence of mucous plug obstruction.
   Finished course of antibiotics.
   - Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive
   spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction daily
 have discussed q2h
   acapella valve usage
   - Per outpatient pulmonologist, trach is unlikely to improve his
   functional status and may worsen his ability to cough; will hold off on
   trach unless patient needs to be intubated
   - Will need deep suctioning and to be on oxygen at LTACH/floor when
   discharged
   - Plan for goals of care discussion on Monday; will contact outpatient
   providers to see when they are available
   #. Fever: In [**Name (NI) **], pt. with low grade fever of 100.1F, could represent
   atelectasis vs. HAP vs. cellulitis on LE given erythema and warmth.
   WBC stable and remains afebrile. Empiric Vanc/Zosyn stopped.
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   - F/u stool Cx
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 20 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue ppx with Bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin
   - Will start azithromycin prophylaxis (500mg daily x 6 days, then 250mg
   on MWF)
   - Continue prednisone at 20 mg daily
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   - will consider increasing prn morphine or change to drip
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**] and then readmitted with hypoxia.
    #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis related to GVHD and
   with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Has LLL collapse
   and some RLL collapse on CT.  No evidence of mucous plug obstruction.
   Finished course of antibiotics.  Patient
s respiratory function has
   declined over the past 48 hours, he is becoming more difficult to
   suction.  Needs to discuss goals of care and become CMO or have a
   trach.
   - Pulmonary hygiene with mechanical in-exsufflator, incentive
   spirometry, acapella valve, deep suction daily
 have discussed q2h
   acapella valve usage
   - Per outpatient pulmonologist, trach is unlikely to improve his
   functional status and may worsen his ability to cough; will hold off on
   trach unless patient needs to be intubated
   - Will need deep suctioning and to be on oxygen at LTACH/floor when
   discharged
   - Plan for goals of care discussion today
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation; New onset this admission, although per patient
   has had episodes in the past.  Likely due to hypoxia and increased
   catcholamine surge.  More responsive to diltiazem than metoprolol ->
   changed to diltiazem.
   - yesterday on PO dilt at 30 mg QID, can increase dosing if not rate
   controlled over course of today
   .
   #. Fever: In [**Name (NI) **], pt. with low grade fever of 100.1F, could represent
   atelectasis vs. HAP vs. cellulitis on LE given erythema and warmth.
   WBC stable and remains afebrile. Empiric Vanc/Zosyn stopped.
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   - F/u stool Cx
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 20 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue ppx with Bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin
   - Will start azithromycin prophylaxis (500mg daily x 6 days, then 250mg
   on MWF)
   - Continue prednisone at 20 mg daily
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   - will consider increasing prn morphine or change to drip
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and complications from an allogeneic stem cell transplant. He presented to the ICU with hypoxia and has been diagnosed with bronchiolitis related to graft versus host disease (GVHD). The patient's respiratory function has declined over the past 48 hours, and he is becoming more difficult to suction. He requires a discussion about goals of care and potential tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's underlying bronchiolitis and multiple respiratory pathogens may lead to worsening hypoxia.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a new onset of atrial fibrillation, likely due to hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge.
3. Fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, which could represent atelectasis, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or cellulitis on the lower extremities.
4. Chronic GVHD: The patient's history of chronic GVHD may contribute to various complications such as chronic abdominal pain and back pain.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and DVT, for which he is receiving enoxaparin prophylaxis.
6. Infection: The patient may be at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with the healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and appropriate management."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and impaired mobility. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of rapid ventricular response requiring treatment with metoprolol and diltiazem. Fluid boluses have been administered totaling 1.5 liters. The patient is experiencing thickened secretions requiring frequent suctioning.

The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently receiving multiple medications, including metoprolol, diltiazem, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and morphine sulfate.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the AFib. Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 112 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure of 91/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is mildly low at 35.3°C. Physical examination reveals poor air movement, diffuse rhonchi that clear after suctioning, and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally with diminished distal pulses.

Lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22300/uL, elevated creatinine at 1.7 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 81-200 mg/dL. Coagulation studies are abnormal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and impaired mobility. The patient has been receiving treatment with metoprolol and diltiazem for AFib, with minimal effect. Fluid boluses totaling 1.5 L have been given, and the patient is experiencing thickened secretions requiring suctioning. The patient's respiratory support includes high flow nebulization, with SpO2 at 92%. The patient's physical examination shows signs of exhaustion, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, poor air movement, and diffuse rhonchi that clear after suctioning. The patient has pitting edema of lower extremities and diminished pulses in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid level. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 91/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and temperature of 35.3 C. The patient is receiving multiple medications including metoprolol, diltiazem, enoxaparin, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's SpO2 is 92%, indicating a potential risk of low oxygen levels in the blood.
2. Impaired Airway Clearance: The patient has poor air movement and diffuse rhonchi, which may indicate impaired clearance of secretions from the"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**] and then readmitted with hypoxia.
    #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis
   related to GVHD and with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past.
   Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.   Finished course of
   antibiotics.  Patient
s respiratory function has declined over the past
   48 hours, he is becoming more difficult to suction; possibly having
   mucus plugging and decreased recruitment secondary to fatigue could all
   be contributing to his hypoxia.  Less likely to be in CHF, as patient
   appears hypovolemic clinically.  This AM, pt made aware that intubation
   would lead to tracheostomy and agreed to proceed.
   - Currently intubated on volume support; will attempt to decrease FiO2
   and possibly switch to PS later today
   - Continue aggressive suctioning, atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Send sputum culture as patient could have recurrent pulm infection
   - IP contact[**Name (NI) **] for tacheostomy
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation; New onset this admission, although per patient
   has had episodes in the past.  Likely due to hypoxia and increased
   catcholamine surge.  More responsive to diltiazem than metoprolol ->
   changed to diltiazem.  Pt also appears volume down this morning, with
   decreased urine output
   - bolus 1 L NS
   - Can consider increasing diltiazem in PM if fluid repletion does not
   improve tachycardia
   .
   #. Fever: In [**Name (NI) **], pt. with low grade fever of 100.1F, could represent
   atelectasis vs. HAP vs. cellulitis on LE given erythema and warmth.
   WBC stable and remains afebrile. Empiric Vanc/Zosyn stopped.  Pt
   remains afebrile but respiratory function has declined with increased
   secretions.
   - Sputum Cx today
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   - F/u stool Cx
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 20 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue ppx with Bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin, acyclovir
   - Will start azithromycin prophylaxis (500mg daily x 6 days, then 250mg
   on MWF); today is day 2.
   - Continue prednisone at 20 mg daily
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   - will consider increasing prn morphine or change to drip
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with allogeneic stem cell transplant and complicating graft versus host disease. He presented from rehab with an episode of hypoxia in the 70s. The patient was discharged from the ICU to a high-level rehab facility on 10/11/2024 and then readmitted with hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD and multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. He has a left lower lobe collapse on CT and finished a course of antibiotics. His respiratory function has declined over the past 48 hours, and he is becoming more difficult to suction. Possible contributing factors include mucus plugging, decreased recruitment secondary to fatigue, and less likely to be in congestive heart failure (CHF) due to hypovolemia.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient had new-onset AF this admission, although he has had episodes in the past. It is likely due to hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge. The patient responded better to diltiazem than metoprolol, so the medication was changed to diltiazem. The patient also appears volume depleted this morning with decreased urine output.

3. Fever: The patient had a low-grade fever of 100."

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**] and then readmitted with hypoxia.
    #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis
   related to GVHD and with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past.
   Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.   Finished course of
   antibiotics.  Now intubated and sedated
   - Currently intubated on AC with volume control; will attempt to
   decrease FiO2 again today before PEEP
   - Continue aggressive suctioning, atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - Send sputum culture as patient could have recurrent pulm infection,
   not sent yesterday
   - IP contact[**Name (NI) **] for tracheostomy, likely will happen this am
   - Likely will need A-line today
   # Hypotension: Will wean pressor as tolerated, likely related to
   sedation and peri-intubation period.
   # Atrial fibrillation: New onset this admission, likely due to hypoxia
   and increased catecholamine surge.  More responsive to diltiazem than
   metoprolol -> changed to diltiazem.  Now has converted to sinus rhythm
   - Can consider increasing diltiazem in future if necessary for RVR
   #. Fever: WBC stable and remains afebrile since admission. Empiric
   Vanc/Zosyn stopped.
   - Sputum Cx today
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   - F/u stool Cx
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 20 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue ppx with Bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin, acyclovir
   - Continue azithromycin prophylaxis (500mg daily x 1 week total, then
   250mg on MWF); today is day 4
   - Continue prednisone at 20 mg daily
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO, getting Tube feeds but likely will need PEG, will
   contact IR
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] get nutrition consult for meds that cannot be crushed like

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with allogeneic stem cell transplant and complications of graft versus host disease (GVHD). The patient presented from rehab with an episode of hypoxia in the 70s and was readmitted to the ICU due to hypoxia.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD, with multiple respiratory pathogens in the recent past. The patient has left lower lobe (LLL) collapse and some right lower lobe (RLL) collapse on CT. The patient finished a course of antibiotics and is now intubated and sedated. The plan is to continue aggressive suctioning, atrovent, and albuterol nebs. A tracheostomy is likely to happen today, and an arterial line (A-line) may be needed soon.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is likely related to sedation and the peri-intubation period. The plan is to wean the pressor as tolerated.

   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**] and then readmitted with hypoxia.
    #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis
   related to GVHD and with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past.
   Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.   Finished course of
   antibiotics.  Now with Trach on ventilator.
   - Currently intubated on AC with volume control; successfully weaned
   FiO2 and PEEP yesterday.  Main barrier to extubation is now sedation
   - Continue aggressive suctioning, atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - f/u sputum Cx
   # Hypotension: Likely related to sedation and peri-intubation period.
   Now improved and pressor stopped.
   # Atrial fibrillation: New onset this admission, likely due to hypoxia
   and increased catecholamine surge.  More responsive to diltiazem than
   metoprolol -> changed to diltiazem.  Now has converted to sinus rhythm.
   - Can consider increasing diltiazem in future if necessary for RVR
   #. Fever: WBC stable and remains afebrile since admission. Empiric
   Vanc/Zosyn stopped.
   - f/u Sputum Cx
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 20 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue ppx with Bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin, acyclovir
   - Continue azithromycin prophylaxis (500mg daily x 1 week total, then
   250mg on MWF); today is day 4
   - Continue prednisone at 20 mg daily
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H (on hold for peg today)

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease (GVHD). He presented from rehab with an episode of hypoxia in the 70s. The patient was discharged from the ICU to a high-level rehab facility on [**2124-10-11**] and then readmitted with hypoxia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and is currently intubated on AC with volume control ventilation. He was successfully weaned from FiO2 and PEEP yesterday, but the main barrier to extubation is now sedation. The patient will continue aggressive suctioning, atrovent, and albuterol nebs, and will follow up with sputum culture.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension likely related to sedation and the peri-intubation period. However, it has improved and pressor support has been stopped.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed new-onset atrial fibrillation this admission, likely due to hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge. It was initially more responsive to diltiazem than metoprolol, so the patient was changed to diltiazem. The patient has now converted to"

   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**] and then readmitted with hypoxia.
    #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis
   related to GVHD and with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past.
   Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.   Finished course of
   antibiotics.  Now with Trach on ventilator.
   - Currently intubated on AC with volume control; successfully weaned
   FiO2 and PEEP yesterday.  Will attempt PS today after placement of PEG
   - Continue aggressive suctioning, atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - f/u sputum Cx; will hold off on abx until culture returns or patient
   becomes febrile
   - will also continue to diurese with goal 2 L neg today; will use lasix
   gtt if patient becomes hypotensive
   # Hypotension: Likely related to sedation and peri-intubation period.
   Now improved and pressor stopped.
   # Atrial fibrillation: New onset this admission, likely due to hypoxia
   and increased catecholamine surge.  More responsive to diltiazem than
   metoprolol -> changed to diltiazem.  Now has converted to sinus rhythm.
   - Can consider increasing diltiazem in future if necessary for RVR
   #. Fever: WBC stable and remains afebrile since admission. Empiric
   Vanc/Zosyn stopped.
   - f/u Sputum Cx
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 20 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue ppx with Bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin, acyclovir
   - Continue azithromycin prophylaxis (500mg daily x 1 week total, then
   250mg on MWF); today is day 4
   - Continue prednisone at 20 mg daily
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H (on hold for peg today)

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease (GVHD). The patient presented from rehab with an episode of hypoxia to the 70s and was discharged from the ICU to a high-level rehab facility on [**2124-10-11**]. He was readmitted with hypoxia. 

The patient has underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD and multiple respiratory pathogens in the recent past. He has left lower lobe (LLL) collapse and some right lower lobe (RLL) collapse on CT. He finished a course of antibiotics and is now intubated on assisted control ventilation with volume control, successfully weaned FiO2 and PEEP yesterday. 

The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), impaired gait and muscle performance, impaired transfers, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired skin integrity, chronic pain, hypoxemia, and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's current treatment plan includes aggressive suctioning, atrovent and albuterol nebs, f/u sputum Cx; will hold off on abx until culture"

   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**] and then readmitted with hypoxia.
    #. Hypoxia: Patient with underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis
   related to GVHD and with multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past.
   Has LLL collapse and some RLL collapse on CT.   Finished course of
   antibiotics.  Now with Trach on ventilator.
   - Currently intubated on AC with volume control; successfully weaned
   FiO2 and PEEP yesterday.  Will attempt PS today after placement of PEG
   - Continue aggressive suctioning, atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - f/u sputum Cx; will hold off on abx until culture returns or patient
   becomes febrile
   - will also continue to diurese with goal 2 L neg today; will use lasix
   gtt if patient becomes hypotensive
   # Atrial fibrillation: New onset this admission, likely due to hypoxia
   and increased catecholamine surge.  More responsive to diltiazem than
   metoprolol -> changed to diltiazem.  Now has converted to sinus rhythm.
   - diltiazem on hold as pt NPO; will resume after PEG placed
   .
   # Depression: Pt appears more withdrawn on exam today.
   - initiate SSRI today
   .
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 20 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue ppx with Bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin, acyclovir
   - Continue azithromycin prophylaxis (500mg daily x 1 week total, then
   250mg on MWF); today is day 4
   - Continue prednisone at 20 mg daily
   .
   #. Chronic abdominal pain and back pain: Thought to be attributable to
   GVHD after negative prior work-up.
   - Continue fentanyl patch, methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches,
   pregabalin
   - pain management consult as patient will be unable to have lyrica in
   the future
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H (on hold for peg today), will likely
   resume in 48 hours
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to sedation and peri-intubation period.
   Now improved and pressor stopped.
   .
   #. Fever: WBC stable and remains afebrile since admission. Empiric
   Vanc/Zosyn stopped.
   - f/u Sputum Cx

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with allogeneic stem cell transplant and complications of graft versus host disease (GVHD). He presented from rehabilitation with an episode of hypoxia in the 70s and was admitted to the ICU. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), impaired gait, muscle performance, transfers, aerobic capacity/endurance, airway clearance, balance, impaired skin integrity, pain control, and hypoxemia. 

The patient's medical history includes episodes of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), chronic abdominal pain and back pain thought to be related to GVHD, and previous admissions to the ICU.

The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including percutaneous tracheostomy, placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), weaning off sedation and ventilator support, and changes in medication including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and pain management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's history of bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD, along with previous respiratory infections, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening of"

   Chief Complaint: Hypoxia
   24 Hour Events:
   - Lovenox restarted in PM
   - Lasix dose at 4pm (20mg IV)
   - Started Celexa and emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] about it
   - Converted meds to NG/PEG, liquid where available
   - Pain management consult: formal recs pending but initially they say
   it is ok to give lyrica through peg (just open capsule per pharmacy),
   they are not sure about pharmakokinetics of giving it this way as it is
   off label -> if not working, would switch to liquid neurontin at
   starting dose 600 mg TID and monitor for sedation.  Also, do not think
   he is absorbing anything from fentanyl patch because of his edema.
   Suggested stopping fentanyl patch and monitoring how much fentanyl
   bolus dosing he needs over next day, then converting to morphine to
   give standing through PEG.  Also, given his poor prognosis he would be
   a candidate for a pump in the future.  Fentanyl patch d/c'd --> using
   fentanyl IV for breakthrough pain
   - Switched to PS in AM ([**8-21**]).  Passed rsbi but RT did not do SBT

   underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD and with
   multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Has LLL collapse and
   some RLL collapse on CT.   Finished course of antibiotics.  Now with
   Trach on ventilator.
   - Currently intubated on AC with volume control; successfully weaned
   FiO2 and PEEP.  Switched to PS this morning after placement of PEG, but
   unable to do SBT due to desats.  Will trial PS today at 10/5 as long as
   patient can tolerate.
   - Continue aggressive suctioning, atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - F/u sputum Cx; will hold off on abx until culture returns or patient
   becomes febrile
   - Will also continue to diurese with goal 2 L neg today; will use lasix
   gtt if patient becomes hypotensive, can give 20mg IV Lasix now with I/o
   Check in the afternoon
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Has chronic abdominal pain
   and back pain thought to be attributable to GVHD after negative prior
   work-up.  Also with multiple compression fractures on his back.
   - Continue methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches, pregabalin via PEG
   - Have switched to fentanyl boluses per pain management recs, is
   requiring 375mcg fentanyl since 9pm last night
   - Will switch to morphine via PEG via pain recs
   - Appreciate pain service recs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): New onset this admission, likely due to
   hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge.  More responsive to
   diltiazem than metoprolol -> changed to diltiazem.  Now has converted
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Have restarted diltiazem since has PEG
   .
 DEPRESSION: Pt has appeared withdrawn since admission, more after
   intubation/trach.
   - Have started SSRI today and emailed oncologist

   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**] and then readmitted with hypoxia.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])/HYPOXEMIA: Patient with
   underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD and with
   multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Has LLL collapse and
   some RLL collapse on CT.   Finished course of antibiotics.  Now with
   Trach on ventilator.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have pulmonary edema in the setting of
   microocclusive disease
   - Currently intubated on AC with volume control; successfully weaned
   FiO2 and PEEP.  Switched to PS  yesterday, but unable to do SBT due to
   desats.  Will adjust vent today, may increase PS or slope of
   inspiration.
   - Continue aggressive suctioning, atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - F/u sputum Cx; will hold off on abx until culture returns or patient
   becomes febrile.  Send another sputum cx today.
   - Will also continue to diurese with goal 2 L neg today; will use lasix
   gtt if patient becomes hypotensive, can give 20mg IV Lasix again now
   with I/o Check in the afternoon
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Has chronic abdominal pain
   and back pain thought to be attributable to GVHD after negative prior
   work-up.  Also with multiple compression fractures on his back.
   - Continue methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches, pregabalin via PEG
   - Have switched to fentanyl boluses per pain management recs, is
   requiring 375mcg fentanyl since 9pm last night
   - Plan to put on morphine PCA overnight to assess pain needs more
   accurately, will confirm appropriate dosing with pain team.  Likely may
   need basal dose overnight on PCA.
   - Appreciate pain service recs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): New onset this admission, likely due to
   hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge.  More responsive to
   diltiazem than metoprolol -> changed to diltiazem.  Now has converted
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Have restarted diltiazem since has PEG
   .
 DEPRESSION: Pt has appeared withdrawn since admission, more after
   intubation/trach.
   - Have started SSRI today and emailed oncologist
   .
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 20 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue ppx with Bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin, acyclovir
   - Continue azithromycin prophylaxis (500mg daily x 1 week total, then
   250mg on MWF); today is day 5
   - Continue prednisone at 20 mg daily
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): Likely related to sedation and
   peri-intubation period.  Now improved and pressor stopped.
   .
   #. Fever: WBC stable and remains afebrile since admission. Empiric
   Vanc/Zosyn stopped.
   - f/u Sputum Cx
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   #.  Anemia: Hct slowly trending down, likely anemia of chronic disease
   and recent procedures.
   - Iron studies if does not improve post-procedures
   - Trend daily Hct
   - Guaiac stools

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant and complicated graft versus host disease (GVHD). He presented from rehab with an episode of hypoxia and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD and multiple respiratory pathogens in the recent past. He has a tracheostomy and is on ventilatory support. His condition is complicated by respiratory failure, acute hypoxemia, pain control, atrial fibrillation, depression, and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD and multiple respiratory pathogens in the recent past. This puts him at risk for further respiratory failure or infection.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia may worsen due to his respiratory failure and underlying lung diseases.
3. Pain Control: The patient has chronic abdominal pain and back pain thought to be attributable to GVHD after negative prior work-up. He also has multiple compression fractures on his back. Adequate pain control is crucial to prevent further complications.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation likely due to hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge. It should be monitored and managed appropriately to prevent complications such"

   Chief Complaint: Hypoxia
   24 Hour Events:
   - Lovenox restarted in PM
   - Lasix dose at 4pm (20mg IV)
   - Started Celexa and emailed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1750**] about it
   - Converted meds to NG/PEG, liquid where available
   - Pain management consult: formal recs pending but initially they say
   it is ok to give lyrica through peg (just open capsule per pharmacy),
   they are not sure about pharmakokinetics of giving it this way as it is
   off label -> if not working, would switch to liquid neurontin at
   starting dose 600 mg TID and monitor for sedation.  Also, do not think
   he is absorbing anything from fentanyl patch because of his edema.
   Suggested stopping fentanyl patch and monitoring how much fentanyl
   bolus dosing he needs over next day, then converting to morphine to
   give standing through PEG.  Also, given his poor prognosis he would be
   a candidate for a pump in the future.  Fentanyl patch d/c'd --> using
   fentanyl IV for breakthrough pain
   - Switched to PS in AM ([**8-21**]).  Passed rsbi but RT did not do SBT
   because sats went to 80s without peep.

   - Will also continue to diurese with goal 2 L neg today; will use lasix
   gtt if patient becomes hypotensive, can give 20mg IV Lasix again now
   with I/o Check in the afternoon
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Has chronic abdominal pain
   and back pain thought to be attributable to GVHD after negative prior
   work-up.  Also with multiple compression fractures on his back.
   - Continue methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches, pregabalin via PEG
   - Have switched to fentanyl boluses per pain management recs, is
   requiring 375mcg fentanyl since 9pm last night
   - Plan to put on morphine PCA overnight to assess pain needs more
   accurately, will confirm appropriate dosing with pain team.  Likely may
   need basal dose overnight on PCA.
   - Appreciate pain service recs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): New onset this admission, likely due to
   hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge.  More responsive to
   diltiazem than metoprolol -> changed to diltiazem.  Now has converted
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Have restarted diltiazem since has PEG
   .
 DEPRESSION: Pt has appeared withdrawn since admission, more after
   intubation/trach.
   - Have started SSRI today and emailed oncologist
   .
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 20 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue ppx with Bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin, acyclovir
   - Continue azithromycin prophylaxis (500mg daily x 1 week total, then
   250mg on MWF); today is day 5
   - Continue prednisone at 20 mg daily
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): Likely related to sedation and
   peri-intubation period.  Now improved and pressor stopped.
   .
   #. Fever: WBC stable and remains afebrile since admission. Empiric
   Vanc/Zosyn stopped.
   - f/u Sputum Cx
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   #.  Anemia: Hct slowly trending down, likely anemia of chronic disease
   and recent procedures.
   - Iron studies if does not improve post-procedures
   - Trend daily Hct
   - Guaiac stools

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
   transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease who
   presented from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s.
   Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high level rehab facility on
   [**2124-10-11**] and then readmitted with hypoxia.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])/HYPOXEMIA: Patient with
   underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD and with
   multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Has LLL collapse and
   some RLL collapse on CT.   Finished course of antibiotics.  Now with
   Trach on ventilator.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have pulmonary edema in the setting of
   microocclusive disease
   - Switched to PS  yesterday, with RSBI 27.  Will do trial of trach
   collar today.
   - Continue aggressive suctioning, atrovent and albuterol nebs
   - sputum Cx from [**10-26**] cancelled.  [**10-24**] shows respiratory flora; no
   need for abx at this time
   - Will also continue to diurese with goal 2 L neg today; will use lasix
   gtt if patient becomes hypotensive, can give 20mg IV Lasix again now
   with I/o Check in the afternoon
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Has chronic abdominal pain
   and back pain thought to be attributable to GVHD after negative prior
   work-up.  Also with multiple compression fractures on his back.
   - Continue methadone, morphine, lidocaine patches, pregabalin via PEG
   - Have switched to morphine PCA overnight to assess pain needs more
   accurately; has required
   - Appreciate pain service recs
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): New onset this admission, likely due to
   hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge.  More responsive to
   diltiazem than metoprolol -> changed to diltiazem.  Now has converted
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Have restarted diltiazem since has PEG
   .
 DEPRESSION: Pt has appeared withdrawn since admission, more after
   intubation/trach.
   - Have started Celexa and amytriptyline
   .
   #. CML s/p BMTs, complicated by chronic GVHD:  At previous admission
   patient was started on a prednisone taper of 60 mg daily and had been
   titrated down to 20 mg daily.
   - Continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - Continue ppx with Bactrim, voriconazole, tobramycin, acyclovir
   - Continue azithromycin prophylaxis (500mg daily x 1 week total, then
   250mg on MWF); today is day 5
   - Continue prednisone at 20 mg daily
   .
   #. Hx of PE, DVT: Patient with multiple prior thrombotic events.
   - Continue enoxaparin 40 mg Q12H
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): Likely related to sedation and
   peri-intubation period.  Now improved and pressor stopped.
   .
   #. Fever: WBC stable and remains afebrile since admission. Empiric
   Vanc/Zosyn stopped.
   - f/u Sputum Cx
   -Trend WBC counts and fever curves
   #.  Anemia: Hct slowly trending down, likely anemia of chronic disease
   and recent procedures.
   - Iron studies if does not improve post-procedures
   - Trend daily Hct
   - Guaiac stools

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant in 2121 and developed graft versus host disease (GVHD). He presented to the ICU with respiratory failure and hypoxia. The patient has bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD, multiple respiratory pathogens in the recent past, left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, and right lower lobe (RLL) collapse on CT.

The patient was treated with antibiotics but now shows no need for further antibiotic therapy as sputum culture from 10/24 shows respiratory flora. He continues to be on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode, with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 27. The patient's blood pressure has been in the 70s around 11 pm, and a 500cc bolus was given, resulting in improvement. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/57 to 112/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

   underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD and with
   multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. Has LLL collapse and
   some RLL collapse on CT.   Finished course of antibiotics.  Now with
   Trach on ventilator.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have pulmonary edema in the setting of
   microocclusive disease
   - Switched to PS  yesterday, with RSBI 27.  Will do trial of trach

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): New onset this admission, likely due to
   hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge.  More responsive to
   diltiazem than metoprolol -> changed to diltiazem.  Now has converted
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Have restarted diltiazem since has PEG

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with an allogeneic stem cell transplant in 2021 and complicating graft versus host disease (GVHD). He presented from rehab with an episode of hypoxia and was admitted to the ICU. The patient has underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD, multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past, and pulmonary edema in the setting of microocclusive disease. He is currently on ventilatory support through a tracheostomy tube and is being weaned off sedation. The patient also has chronic abdominal pain and back pain thought to be attributable to GVHD after negative prior work-up. He has multiple compression fractures on his back. The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation (AFib) likely due to hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge. He has converted to sinus rhythm and is being restarted on diltiazem. The patient appears withdrawn since admission and more so after intubation/trach, and has started on citalopram and amitriptyline. He has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He continues on enoxaparin prophylaxis. The patient's blood pressure has improved and the pressor has been stopped. He is currently afebrile, but his white blood cell (WBC)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant in 2121 and developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presented to the hospital with respiratory failure and hypoxia, and was previously discharged from the ICU to a rehabilitation facility. Upon readmission, he is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD, pulmonary edema, chronic abdominal pain, back pain, atrial fibrillation, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. The underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD, along with the presence of pulmonary edema, increase the risk of further respiratory complications.
2. Infection: Despite recent antibiotics, there is a risk of developing new infections due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged intubation.
3. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, increasing the risk of thrombotic events while in the ICU.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are trending down, suggesting anemia. Further investigation and management are needed to address this issue.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): New onset this admission, likely due to
   hypoxia and increased catecholamine surge.  More responsive to
   diltiazem than metoprolol -> changed to diltiazem.  Now has converted
   to sinus rhythm.
   - Have restarted diltiazem since has PEG

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant in 2021. The patient presented to the ICU with respiratory failure and hypoxemia. He had been discharged from the ICU previously but was readmitted due to hypoxia. The patient has underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to graft versus host disease (GVHD) and has had multiple respiratory pathogens in recent past. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure/acute hypoxemia, pain control, atrial fibrillation, depression, and complications related to GVHD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure/Acute Hypoxemia: The patient's underlying bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis related to GVHD, along with multiple respiratory pathogens, put him at risk for recurrent respiratory infections and further deterioration of respiratory function.

2. Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD): The patient's history of GVHD increases the risk of developing chronic GVHD complications such as liver dysfunction, gastrointestinal disturbances, skin problems, and pulmonary issues.

3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to stem cell transplantation and ongoing immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk of opportunistic infections, including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.

4. Thrombotic Events: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein throm"

   Tolerated trache mask for 2 hours yesetrday and will try longer period
   today.  Sputm cx remains underwhelming.  Likely still has some
   pulmonary edema but difficult to diurese with low BP (exacerbated by
   pain meds).  No signif SOB on trache collar and good Vt.   Remains
   afebrile with min secretions and we will not broaden abx.  Pain control
   remains an issue but seems more comfortable and did not use PCA as much
   as he could.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and pain control issues. The patient's past medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for fatigue, dry mouth, and abdominal pain. The patient is currently receiving PCA for pain management and has been tolerating trache mask for short periods of time.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40% and has a respiratory system compliance of 27.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, poor dentition, normocephalic head, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, no murmurs, and no peripheral edema. Respiratory examination shows clear breath sounds with crackles bilaterally. Abdominal examination shows tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Musculoskeletal examination reveals muscle wasting and inability to stand. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, oriented to person, place, and time, and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, elevated potassium, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating.

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, hypox"
