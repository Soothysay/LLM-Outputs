   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia and altered mental status. The patient's history includes drug detox, overdose on hydroxyzine, and previous transfer to another hospital with hypoxemia. In the ER, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone. There is a concern that the patient may have used heroin during their visit.

The patient has allergies to magnesium, anaphylaxis, latex, salicylate, benzocaine, and methemoglobinemia. The last dose of antibiotics was given through infusions. The patient is currently on multiple ICU medications.

The patient's medical history includes asthma, intravenous drug use (IVDU), septic arthritis in the left knee, osteonecrosis, hepatitis C, surgical placement of a subcutaneous port (sPTX), and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with blebectomy. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for constitutional symptoms of fever, respiratory symptoms of cough and dyspnea, and musculoskeletal joint pain.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/65 mmHg to 131/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula"

   Assessment and Plan
   25 yo female with past medical history of asthma complicated by
   multiple intubation and IV drug abuse complicated by septic shock and
   septic arthritis. Patient was sent from [**Hospital1 250**] for ED evaluation of
   pneumonia after her oxygen saturation was noted to be low.
   #. Hypoxia, fevers:
   Likely that the two are related in an infectious process such as a
   bacterial pneumonia given associated productive cough, increased WBC
   count, and CXR finding of multifocal pneumonia. Additionally could be
   influenza. Unknown vaccination status, though she has not shown for any
   follow-up appointments from her prior hospitalization, so unlikely that
   she has been vaccinated.
   - Send sputum sample for culture (not sent yet)
   - Given patient's recent presentation to healthcare and her current
   residence in a drug rehab facility, will initially treat broadly with
   Vancomycin, Zosyn, Azithromycin (D1:[**1-9**]) to cover both
   hospital-associated and community pathogens
   - retry for Nasopharyngeal swab for influenza DFA and droplet
   precautions pending
   - Treat empirically for influenza with oseltamivir 75 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   #. Somnolence:
   Obviously somnolent and sleeping though denies this vehemently.
   Possible that her somnolence is related to a toxic ingestion given her
   past history of drug abuse in conjunction with verbal report from ED
   that patient went to restroom and came back to ED room much more
   somnolent. No association with miosis to strongly suggest that an
   opiate is at fault. She was given 2 mg IV lorazepam in the ED and this
   could be a hangover effect. Most concerning would be if this were a
   presentation of hypercarbia in setting of poor ventilatory effort due
   to underlying asthma.
   - Hold all sedating medications including tramadol, benzos, methadone,
   gabapentin.
   - Closely monitor patient's alertness and do not give POs while sedate
   - Monitor RR once patient falls asleep
   - Ideally, would obtain ABG to assess patient's pCO2 given her
   somnolence; however, patient denies somnolence and strongly refusing
   ABG at this time
   #. Asthma:
   Patient has suboptimal air movement at presentation to the ICU with
   inspiratory and expiratory wheezing and some slight tachypnea. Patient
   reports mild wheezing, though denies dyspnea.
   - Standing ipratropium and albuterol as well as PRN albuterol nebs
   - Prednisone 60 mg now and then taper pending clinical improvement
   - Continue home monteleukast, advair
   - Notify patient's outpatient pulmonary doctor, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5186**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1152**]
   (fellow), of admission
   #. Opiate addiction:
   - Continue methadone 15 mg daily as mental status allows
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Regular, though hold POs while somnolent
   Lines: 20 Gauge - [**2143-1-9**] 11:46 PM
   Prophylaxis:
   - DVT ppx with heparin subcutaneous
   - Bowel regimen with docusate and senna
   - Pain management with home regimen of tramadol, ibuprofen, gabapentin
   as long as mental status allows

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of asthma, multiple intubations, and IV drug abuse. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of pneumonia and low oxygen saturation. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock and septic arthritis. She is currently receiving treatment for a possible bacterial pneumonia, influenza, and other infections. The patient is also being treated for opioid addiction with methadone. Her current conditions include hypoxia, fevers, somnolence, asthma, and potential opiate overdose. She is receiving various medications and treatments to manage these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of asthma and is currently experiencing respiratory issues such as wheezing and tachypnea. There is a possibility of further respiratory complications, including exacerbation of asthma, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock and septic arthritis, indicating a systemic infection. There is a risk of developing new infections due to her weakened immune system and prolonged hospital stay.

3. Opiate Overdose: The patient's somnolence could be related to an opiate overdose, especially considering her history of IV drug abuse. Continuous monitoring of her mental status and respiratory function is crucial to prevent potential complications related to opiate overdose, such as respiratory depression.

4. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient has been placed on"

   pneumonia after her oxygen saturation was noted to be low.
   #. Hypoxia, fevers:
   Likely that the two are related in an infectious process such as a
   bacterial pneumonia given associated productive cough, increased WBC
   count, however CXR findings underwhelming compared to previous.
   Additionally could be influenza. Unknown vaccination status, though she
   has not shown for any follow-up appointments from her prior
   hospitalization, so unlikely that she has been vaccinated.  Unclear the
   CXR and CT findings over the years indicate asthma but might represent
   a different underlying chronic lung process such as respiratory
   bronchiolitis.
   - Send sputum sample for culture (not sent yet)
   - Will narrow antibiotics to Levaquin and Ceftriaxone as she has not
   yet failed Levaquin treatment (only on it for day of presentation).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of asthma, multiple intubations, IV drug abuse, septic shock, and septic arthritis. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of pneumonia and low oxygen saturation. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 105/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula.

The patient has a productive cough and increased white blood cell count, suggesting an infectious process such as bacterial pneumonia or influenza. A sputum sample for culture, influenza DFA test, and follow-up blood cultures have been ordered. Antibiotics have been narrowed to Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone.

The patient's somnolence upon arrival was initially suspected to be related to a toxic ingestion, but it was later attributed to the hangover effect of IV lorazepam given in the emergency department. Sedating medications have been held pending confirmation with psychiatry.

The patient's asthma is being treated with ipratropium and albuterol nebs, as well as oral medications such as montelukast and fluticasone-salmeterol. A short course of prednisone has also been prescribed.

The patient's history of opioid addiction is being managed with methadone therapy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of asthma and IV drug abuse. She was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and septic shock. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/70 mmHg to 131/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, bronchodilators, and pain management.

The patient has several medical complications that need attention. Firstly, she has hypoxia and fevers, suggesting an ongoing infectious process such as bacterial pneumonia. A sputum sample for culture should be sent, and the patient will be treated empirically with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Azithromycin to cover hospital-associated and community pathogens. Additionally, a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza DFA and droplet precautions are pending.

Secondly, the patient is somnolent but denies it, which could be related to a toxic ingestion or hypercarbia due to poor ventilatory effort. It is important to hold all sedating medications and closely monitor the patient's alertness.

Thirdly, the patient has asthma with suboptimal air movement at presentation. She will receive standing ipratropium and albuterol, as well as PRN albuterol nebs"

   includes pulmonary edema--drug reaction. Stable bilateral upper lobe
   mild bronchiectasis. Severe compression fractures of the vertebral
   bodies are stable. Multiple subpleural blebs.
   Assessment and Plan
   25 yo female with past medical history of asthma complicated by
   multiple intubations and IV drug abuse complicated by septic shock and
   septic arthritis. Patient was sent from [**Hospital1 250**] for ED evaluation of
   pneumonia after her oxygen saturation was noted to be low.
   #. Hypoxia, fevers:  She was admitted for hypoxia in the setting of
   fevers and productive cough and increased WBC count.  CXR was slightly
   worse than previous, but not consistent with bacterial pneumonia as she
   has had these changes previously.  Had CT chest yesterday that shows
   diffuse ground-glass opacities sparing the periphery that could
   represent chronic infection vs drug-induced lung injury vs other
   chronic process.  Less likely that she has influenza at this point, has
   remained afebrile since presentation.
   - Send sputum sample for culture if possible
   - Will contine original course of Levaquin x 7 days (today is day 3 of
   7 day course), will stop Ceftriaxone
   - Retry for Nasopharyngeal swab for influenza DFA and droplet
   precautions pending, patient was not able to cooperate yesterday
   - Treat empirically for influenza with oseltamivir 75 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - FU CT chest final read
   #. Somnolence: Now resolved, although sleepy this morning after all the
   medications given for sleep last night.  Unclear why she was somnolent
   on presentation but may have been related to an ingestion in the ED.
   - Closely monitor patient's alertness and do not give POs while sedate
   - Monitor RR once patient falls asleep
   #. Agiitation: Patient being follow by psychiatry and had a Code Purple
   called for extreme agitation, trying to leave AMA, and trying to meet
   her brother who wanted to
bring her something.
  She was not capable

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a past medical history of asthma, multiple intubations, and IV drug abuse. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia, fevers, and productive cough. The CT chest shows diffuse ground-glass opacities that could represent chronic infection, drug-induced lung injury, or other chronic processes. The patient has been treated with antibiotics and antiviral medications. She also has a history of septic arthritis in the left knee and multiple total knee replacements. The patient's current condition includes somnolence, agitation, asthma, opiate addiction, and knee pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a possible respiratory issue. This could be due to pneumonia, chronic infection, drug-induced lung injury, or other chronic processes.
2. Fevers: The presence of fevers suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory process in the body. It is important to monitor and treat any underlying infection.
3. Productive Cough: The patient's productive cough may indicate pneumonia or bronchitis. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to manage these symptoms.
4. Agitation: The patient's extreme agitation and attempted leave against medical advice (AMA) can be concerning. Additional psychiatric evaluation and medication may be required to manage her agitation.
5. Opiate Addiction: The patient has a history of opiate addiction, and it is crucial to manage her pain while avoiding narcotics"

   infectious and may represent PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4164**]. Differential diagnosis
   includes pulmonary edema--drug reaction. Stable bilateral upper lobe
   mild bronchiectasis. Severe compression fractures of the vertebral
   bodies are stable. Multiple subpleural blebs.
   Assessment and Plan
   25 yo female with past medical history of asthma complicated by
   multiple intubations and IV drug abuse complicated by septic shock and
   septic arthritis. Patient was sent from [**Hospital1 250**] for ED evaluation of
   pneumonia after her oxygen saturation was noted to be low.
   #. Hypoxia, fevers:  She was admitted for hypoxia in the setting of
   fevers and productive cough and increased WBC count.  CXR was slightly
   worse than previous, but not consistent with bacterial pneumonia as she
   has had these changes previously.  However, being treated for PNA due
   to increased WBC, fevers, infiltrate on CXR.  Had CT chest yesterday
   that shows diffuse ground-glass opacities sparing the periphery that
   could represent chronic infection vs drug-induced lung injury vs other
   chronic process.  Less likely that she has influenza at this point, has
   remained afebrile since presentation.
   - Send sputum sample for culture if possible
   - Will contine original course of Levaquin x 7 days (today is day 3 of
   7 day course) and will switch ceftriaxone to po medication
   (cefpodoxime)
    - Retry for Nasopharyngeal swab for influenza DFA and droplet
   precautions pending, patient was not able to cooperate yesterday
   - Treat empirically for influenza with oseltamivir 75 mg [**Hospital1 **] until
   rules out
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - FU CT chest final read
   - Would likely benefit from lung biopsy or bronch but feel that this
   would be prohibitively difficult in this patient
   - Will be discussed at conference today
   #. Agitation: Patient being followed by psychiatry and had a Code
   Purple called for extreme agitation, trying to leave AMA, and trying to
   meet her brother who wanted to
bring her something.
  She was not
   capable of articulating the risks of leaving AMA and the psych team
   came to see her.  Additional seroquel and Ativan was given as needed.
   Currently somewhat somnolent, likely due to medications received last
   night.
   - Continue Seroquel 50mg po bid and 100mg po qhs at home dose
   - Continue Ativan 1mg po TID with additional doses as needed for
   agitation
   - Appreciate psych recs, are following
   - Continue 1:1 sitter, needed security sitter overnight last night
   - Consider ECG to look for QT prolongation
   #. Restrictive lung disease: Likely an ongoing chronic problem.
   - Standing ipratropium and albuterol as well as PRN albuterol nebs
   - Prednisone 60mg daily for short course x 5 day course, will taper
   quickly as she may not need this
   - Continue home montelukast, advair
   - Patient's outpatient pulmonary doctor, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5186**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1152**] (fellow),
   notified of admission and will likely visit today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of asthma and IV drug abuse. She was admitted for hypoxia, fevers, and productive cough. Her oxygen saturation is currently at 95% on room air, and she is on mechanical ventilation. She has a past medical history of septic shock, septic arthritis, and multiple intubations. The patient's current conditions include agitation, restrictive lung disease, and opiate addiction.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation indicates a potential risk of inadequate oxygen supply to the body tissues. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly addressed.

2. Fevers: The presence of fevers suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. If not properly managed, it can progress to sepsis, leading to systemic inflammation and organ damage.

3. Agitation: The patient's agitation may be due to various causes such as medication side effects, withdrawal symptoms, or underlying psychological issues. If not managed appropriately, it can increase the risk of self-harm or injury to healthcare providers.

4. Restrictive lung disease: The patient has a history of asthma, which is a type of restrictive lung disease. Poorly controlled asthma can lead to respiratory distress and complications like pneumonia.

5. Opiate addiction: The patient's opiate addiction poses a risk of developing complications related to"

   She is very difficult.  Her psychiatric dis makes it difficult to
   evaluate her respiratory dis and sx.  I am underwhelmed by the evidence
   for asthma playing a role now.  She primarily has interstitial lung dis
   and is unlikely to be steroid responsive. Will discuss at conference.
   Psyche and Public Safety are helping us evaluate and manage her
   behavior.  Has not been able to tolerate nasal lavage so we do not yet
   know if she truly has influenza.  Prognosis is very poor.

 RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE (INCLUDING NEUROMUSCULAR, CHEST WALL)
 .H/O ANXIETY
 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, OTHER (INCLUDING SCHIZOPHRENIA, PERSONALITY
   DISORDERS)
   25 yo female with past medical history of asthma complicated by
   multiple intubations and IV drug abuse complicated by septic shock and
   septic arthritis. Patient was sent from [**Hospital1 250**] for ED evaluation of
   pneumonia after her oxygen saturation was noted to be low.
   #. Hypoxia, fevers:  She was admitted for hypoxia in the setting of
   fevers and productive cough and increased WBC count.  CXR was slightly
   worse than previous, but not consistent with bacterial pneumonia as she
   has had these changes previously.  However, being treated for PNA due
   to increased WBC, fevers, infiltrate on CXR.  Had CT chest yesterday
   that shows diffuse ground-glass opacities sparing the periphery that
   could represent chronic infection vs drug-induced lung injury vs other
   chronic process.  Less likely that she has influenza at this point, has
   remained afebrile since presentation.
   - Send sputum sample for culture if possible
   - Will contine original course of Levaquin x 7 days (today is day 3 of
   7 day course) and will switch ceftriaxone to po medication
   (cefpodoxime)
    - Retry for Nasopharyngeal swab for influenza DFA and droplet
   precautions pending, patient was not able to cooperate yesterday
   - Treat empirically for influenza with oseltamivir 75 mg [**Hospital1 **] until
   rules out
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - FU CT chest final read
   - Would likely benefit from lung biopsy or bronch but feel that this
   would be prohibitively difficult in this patient
   - Will be discussed at conference today
   #. Agitation: Patient being followed by psychiatry and had a Code
   Purple called for extreme agitation, trying to leave AMA, and trying to
   meet her brother who wanted to
bring her something.
  She was not
   capable of articulating the risks of leaving AMA and the psych team
   came to see her.  Additional seroquel and Ativan was given as needed.
   Currently somewhat somnolent, likely due to medications received last
   night.
   - Continue Seroquel 50mg po bid and 100mg po qhs at home dose
   - Continue Ativan 1mg po TID with additional doses as needed for
   agitation
   - Appreciate psych recs, are following
   - Continue 1:1 sitter, needed security sitter overnight last night
   - Consider ECG to look for QT prolongation
   #. Restrictive lung disease: Likely an ongoing chronic problem.
   - Standing ipratropium and albuterol as well as PRN albuterol nebs
   - Prednisone 60mg daily for short course x 5 day course, will taper
   quickly as she may not need this
   - Continue home montelukast, advair
   - Patient's outpatient pulmonary doctor, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5186**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1152**] (fellow),
   notified of admission and will likely visit today
   #. Opiate addiction:
   - Continue methadone taper as recommended by psych.
   - Will give 10mg po today, 5mg po tomorrow, then off
   - Will not give additional narcotics, confirmed with orthopedist and
   dentist
   #. Knee pain: Has a history of septic arthritis in the left knee and
   multiple total knee replacements.  Currently knee does not appear
   infected and patient moving comfortably around her room.
   - Continue tramadol, Tylenol, ibuprofen, and gabapentin for pain
   - Avoid narcotics

   Disposition: Will need to stay here today pending full workup of lung

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 25-year-old female with a past medical history of asthma, multiple intubations, IV drug abuse, septic shock, and septic arthritis.
- She was admitted for hypoxia, fevers, and productive cough. She is being treated for pneumonia but may have a chronic lung condition or drug-induced lung injury.
- The patient has a history of opiate addiction and is currently undergoing a methadone taper.
- She also has a history of septic arthritis in the left knee and multiple total knee replacements.
- The patient has been agitated and tried to leave against medical advice (AMA), but is currently somewhat somnolent due to medications.
- She requires ongoing pain management and has restrictive lung disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of asthma, pneumonia, and possible chronic lung disease, she is at risk for respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient's history of septic arthritis and IV drug abuse puts her at a higher risk for infections, including bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and wound infections.
3. Opiate Withdrawal or Relapse: Since the patient has a history of opiate addiction, there is a risk of opiate withdrawal"

   DISORDERS)
   25 yo female with past medical history of asthma complicated by
   multiple intubations and IV drug abuse complicated by septic shock and
   septic arthritis. Patient was sent from [**Hospital1 250**] for ED evaluation of
   pneumonia after her oxygen saturation was noted to be low.
   #. Hypoxia, fevers:  She was admitted for hypoxia in the setting of
   fevers and productive cough and increased WBC count.  CXR was slightly
   worse than previous, but not consistent with bacterial pneumonia as she
   has had these changes previously.  However, being treated for PNA due
   to increased WBC, fevers, infiltrate on CXR.  Had CT chest that shows
   diffuse ground-glass opacities sparing the periphery that could
   represent chronic infection vs drug-induced lung injury vs other
   chronic process.  Influenza negative, afebrile since admission
   -flu negative, Tamiflu d/c
   - Will contine original course of Levaquin x 7 days (today is day 4 of
   7 day course) and change from ceftriaxone to cefpodoxime
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   #. Agitation: Patient being followed by psychiatry and had a Code
   Purple called for extreme agitation, trying to leave AMA, and trying to
   meet her brother who wanted to
bring her something.
  She was not
   capable of articulating the risks of leaving AMA and the psych team
   came to see her.  Additional seroquel and Ativan was given as needed.
   - Continue Seroquel 50mg po bid and 100mg po qhs at home dose
   - Continue Ativan 1mg po TID with additional doses as needed for
   agitation
   - Appreciate psych recs, are following
   - 1:1 sitter?
   #. Restrictive lung disease: Likely an ongoing chronic problem.
   - Standing ipratropium and albuterol as well as PRN albuterol nebs
   - Prednisone 30mg daily for short course x 5 day course, will taper
   quickly as she may not need this
   - Continue home montelukast, advair
   - Patient's outpatient pulmonary doctor, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5186**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1152**] (fellow),
   notified of admission
   #. Opiate addiction:
   - Continue methadone taper as recommended by psych.
   - 5mg Methadone today, then off
   - Will not give additional narcotics, confirmed with orthopedist and
   dentist
   #. Knee pain: Has a history of septic arthritis in the left knee and
   multiple total knee replacements.  Currently knee does not appear
   infected and patient moving comfortably around her room and s/p
   nonseptic tap
   - Continue tramadol, Tylenol, ibuprofen, and gabapentin for pain

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of asthma, IV drug abuse, septic shock, and septic arthritis. She was admitted for hypoxia, fevers, and productive cough. The patient's oxygen saturation was low, and she had an increased white blood cell count. A chest X-ray showed slight worsening compared to previous ones, but not consistent with bacterial pneumonia. However, she was treated for pneumonia due to the increased WBC count, fevers, and infiltrate on the chest X-ray. A CT scan of the chest revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities sparing the periphery, which could represent chronic infection, drug-induced lung injury, or other chronic processes. The influenza test was negative, and she is afebrile since admission.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation indicates inadequate oxygen supply to the tissues, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not corrected.
2. Fevers: Elevated body temperature can be a sign of infection or inflammation. If left untreated, it can lead to systemic complications such as sepsis.
3. Productive cough: This may be a symptom of respiratory infection or pneumonia. If the infection is not treated appropriately, it can progress and cause further respiratory complications.
4. Increased WBC count: A high white blood cell count typically indicates an infection or inflammation in the body. If the underlying cause is not identified and treated, it can lead"

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with a past medical history of asthma, complicated by multiple intubations and IV drug abuse. She was admitted for hypoxia, fevers, and productive cough. Her oxygen saturation was low, and she was sent from Hospital1 for evaluation of pneumonia. The patient has been treated for pneumonia due to increased WBC count, fevers, and infiltrate on chest X-ray. However, her CT chest showed diffuse ground-glass opacities sparing the periphery, which could represent chronic infection, drug-induced lung injury, or other chronic processes. The patient is also being treated for leukocytosis, agitation, restrictive lung disease, opiate addiction, and knee pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation indicates a potential risk of inadequate oxygen supply to vital organs.
2. Infection: The patient's fever, increased WBC count, and infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection.
3. Chronic lung disease: The presence of diffuse ground-glass opacities on the CT chest indicates the possibility of chronic lung disease.
4. Drug-induced lung injury: The patient's history of IV drug abuse and the presence of ground-glass opacities on the CT chest raise the possibility of drug-induced lung injury.

   Assessment and Plan
 Restrictive lung disease/Asthma/Hypoxemia
   - unclear what underlying lung disease is currently
   - will change to oral antibiotics today - cefpodoxime/levofloxacin
   - now on day 4 of oral steroids, no plan for taper
   - counseled on tobacco cessation
 Psychiatric Disease/Agitation/Behavoiral disorder
   - on seroquel/ativan and prn haldol
   - sitter and security when necessary, not currently requiring
 Opiod abuse
   - discontinuing methadone after today's dose
   - plan for transfer back to [**Hospital1 250**]
 Leukocytosis
   - likely due to steroids, no other signs of worsening infection
   - culture if spikes

","Summary:
The patient is a 25-year-old female with hypoxemia, who has undergone arthrocentesis of her right knee without evidence of infection. She has allergies to magnesium, latex, and salicylates. She was given antibiotics including azithromycin, vancomycin, and levofloxacin. The patient is receiving ICU medications such as lorazepam, morphine sulfate, and famotidine. Her vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient has received a total of 2,590 mL of fluids and has had 2,040 mL of urine output. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, blood glucose, and liver enzymes. The assessment and plan include restrictive lung disease/asthma/hypoxemia, psychiatric disease/agitation/behavioral disorder, opioid abuse, leukocytosis, and ICU care.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has hypoxemia, which indicates a reduced level of oxygen in the blood. This can be caused by various respiratory conditions such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or exacerbation of underlying lung diseases like asthma. Respiratory support may be required, and further investigations like chest X-ray or pulmonary function tests may help identify the specific respiratory condition.

2. Infection:"
