   Code status:
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and hepatitis C infection. He presents with BRBPR and is currently in the ICU. 

The patient has a suspected gastrointestinal bleed (GIB), most likely due to colitis, but other causes such as small vessel ischemia and infectious/inflammatory processes are also considered. The patient's current presentation is less likely to be due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) given his history of gastric ulcers.

The plan includes monitoring hemodynamics, sending for C. diff and stool cultures, providing pain control with IV medications, and keeping the patient NPO for now. The patient also has a history of CAD with chronic angina symptoms, and an EKG without any acute changes. In the setting of GIB, ASA should be held.

Other plans include repleting lytes as needed, pneumoboots, and PPI prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition will be called out to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of the gastrointestinal condition leading to worsening bleeding or perforation, development of sepsis due to infection, cardiac complications related to CAD, electrolyte imbalances, and hepatic encephalopathy due to worsening liver function from Hep C infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is currently in the ICU. They have been experiencing fever, gastrointestinal bleeding, anxiety, and pain. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, mild hypotension, and a SpO2 of 93% on a nasal cannula. They have been receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, lorazepam, and hydromorphone. The patient's labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated potassium levels. Their blood cultures are growing gram-positive cocci in the blood, for which they have been started on vancomycin. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and has received ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in the past. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive blood cultures indicate a possible infection. If the infection progresses, it could lead to sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is experiencing lower gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by hematochezia, bradypnea, and gastrointestinal bleed. This can lead to significant blood loss and may require urgent intervention.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, indicating mild hypotension."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and lower gastrointestinal colitis, as seen on CT scan. He has a history of gastric ulcer, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN). The patient's chief complaint is bloody red brown pink stools (BRBPR). 

The patient has been receiving various medications including morphine sulfate, lorazepam, hydromorphone, protonix, and lidocaine patch. He is currently on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for suspected infection. His allergies include sulfonamide antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/71 mmHg to 139/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 3 liters.

The patient has been monitored closely with hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. He is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric (NG) tube and is NPO (nothing by mouth). 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds with bibasilar crackles, tender lower left quadrant (LLQ) and right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdomen, and absent peripheral pulses in both right and left extremities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, rapid ventricular response, lower gastrointestinal bleed, and colitis. He was admitted to the MICU and later transferred to the floor. The patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation with a heart rate climbing to 170 and was given Lopressor and 2 L IVF for blood pressure in the 90's. He is now on diltiazem gtt.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to an irregular and often rapid heart rate. This increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
2. Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's heart rate is very high (170 bpm), indicating a rapid ventricular response. This can further complicate the management of his atrial fibrillation and increase the risk of cardiac complications.
3. Lower Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has experienced a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which can result in significant blood loss and may lead to hypotension and shock if not managed properly.
4. Colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with colitis, which is an inflammation of the colon. If left untreated, it can lead to severe complications such as perforation or sepsis.
5. Asbestos Exposure: The patient has a history of asbestos exposure, which increases the risk of developing lung diseases like asbestosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB) -
   access OK, Hct stable, follow
   colitis - CDiff negative, complete 7 day course of cipro and flagyl
   A-fib - continue dilt gtt, volume resuscitate, follow EKG, enzymes,
   hold off on anticoag
   bacteremia -  follow-up cultures negative, CVL still in place, will
   replace tomorrow, continue vanco for now
   lung fibrosis - likely IPF, also some asbestos exposure, eventually
   needs eval as outpatient

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (a-fib) and rapid ventricular response (RVR). He was admitted to the ICU for lower gastrointestinal bleeding and had a CT scan showing colitis. The patient was transferred to the floor yesterday but developed rapid a-fib this morning with a heart rate climbing to 170. He was given lopressor and 2 L IVF for blood pressure in the 90's. He is now on diltiazem gtt.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including PUD (peptic ulcer disease), CAD (coronary artery disease) with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension (HTN), UTI (urinary tract infection), and a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 121 bpm (with a normal range of 85-127 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 103/60-132/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 17-24 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula with 3 LPM of oxygen. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 13.2"

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of 24-hour events in the ICU. The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and transitioned to PO diltiazem. The patient's intravenous (IV) lines were changed, with a PICC line placed and an internal jugular (IJ) line removed. A chest X-ray showed increasing edema and possible pneumonia. The patient developed mild hypoxia overnight, ranging from the low 80s on the respiratory accessory (RA). Oxygen therapy was administered via nasal cannula to prevent the patient from removing it. The patient stopped vancomycin due to a blood culture growing coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Ciprofloxacin was changed to levofloxacin for added lung coverage. Flagyl was continued.

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and an unknown allergy. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin (2129-1-9) at 09:40 AM, ciprofloxacin (2129-1-9) at 10:45 AM, levofloxacin (2129-1-9) at 09:03 PM, and metronidazole (2129-1-10) at 12:04 AM. Other ICU medications included diltiazem (2129-1-9) at 06:43 AM, pantoprazole (Protonix) (2129-1-9) at 08:15 PM, and furosemide (Lasix) (2129-1-9) at 10:00 PM.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following:
- Fever
- Flowsheet Data:
   - Vital signs: The patient's temperature ranged from 38.3 to 37.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) was 84 bpm with a range of 84-127 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranged from 102/60 mmHg to 117/92 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) was 19 breaths per minute with a range of 15-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 93% on nasal cannula.
   - Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) was 3 mmHg with a range of 3-7 mmHg.
   - Fluid balance: Total input was 4,098 mL, with 757 mL through the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, and total output was 1,670 mL.

Physical Examination:
- General appearance: The patient appeared well-nourished and not in acute distress.
- Eyes/conjunctiva: Pupils were equal and reactive, and the ocular movement was clear"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ?
   Hep C infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with
   Afib with RVR.
   .
   # Afib with RVR. Was in sinus tach earlier in day (to 110-120) with new
   Afib prompting MICU transfer.  Trigger for Afib includes hypovolemia
   from GIB, sepsis/infection, pulmonary embolus or other pulm process.
   Was also on BB at baseline that has been held.  Unclear etiology now.
   - Volume resuscitated and now in pulmonary edema; unclear if pulmonary
   edema preceded afib and was the cause
   - afib converted to NSR after dilt gtt, now on dilt PO
   - TSH and echo for workup
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Pulm edema
 likely from fluid rescussitation in setting of GI bleed
   and tachycardia
   - diurese as tolerated by BP
   - f/u CXR tomorrow
   - f/u echo for heart function
   .
   # Relative hypotension.  To SBP 90s after receiving 1 IV dilaudid and
   IV/PO metoprolol with Afib/RVR in addition.
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib
   - no change in mentation, change in UO, perfusing appropriately
   - titrate dilt to SBP of approximately 100
   .
   # GIB: CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid
   junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels were patent in
   prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and inflammatory
   also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions required with
   continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward steadily.
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient to evaluate
   - cont cipro and flagyl  per ID recs
   - f/u c diff and stool cultures
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] recs
   - tolerating clears
   .
    # Hypoxia
 likely from combination of underlying fibrosis and pulm
   edema, does not appear to have infection in lung
   - briefly on levoflox for possible pna, stopping today and continuing
   above abx for colitis
   - O2 NC as needed
   - diuresis as outlined above
   #Bacteremia: Pt with GPC growing in blood. He was started on
   vancomycin. Possible contamination ([**11-23**]) vs true infection. Pt has been
   febrile, but other sources of infection.  Grew coag negative staph
   - likely contaminant, stopping vanco
   .
   .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV AB and VL pending.
   - likely cause of elevated INR, consider reversing in setting of GI
   bleed with Vit K
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes.
   - restart ASA.
   - serial ECG.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with bloody bowel movement and later transferred back to the MICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, pulmonary edema, and relative hypoxia. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/60 mmHg to 117/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The physical examination reveals that he is well-nourished and not in acute distress. His cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia and irregular rhythm. The respiratory examination reveals bibasilar coarse crackles. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine level. Other lab values are within normal range. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib/RVR) possibly due to hypovolemia from gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis/infection, pulmonary embolus, or other pulmonary process. He has been successfully converted to sinus rhythm after receiving diltiazem gel and is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and possible Hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with bloody red brown postural (BRBPR) and is now transferred back to the MICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR). The trigger for the Afib includes hypovolemia from gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), sepsis/infection, pulmonary embolus, or other pulmonary process. The patient was also on beta-blockers (BB) at baseline, which has been held.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Volume resuscitation - The patient has received 2 liters of normal saline intravenously. Watch urine output, check central venous pressure (CVP), and can bolus further if less than 6 mL/kg. Watch hematocrit.
2. Continue coverage for colitis and gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in blood (cipro/flagyl and vancomycin).
3. Repeat ECG now with slower rates to reassess for ST changes.
4. Check transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to evaluate atrial size.
5. Consider anticoagulation in the long term; will not currently give recent GIB and duration x few hours thus far.
6. Relative hypotension. To systolic blood pressure (SBP) 90s after receiving 1 IV dilaudid and IV/PO metoprolol with Afib/RVR in addition.
7. Intravenous fluid (IVF) resuscitation as above. Treatment and workup of underlying trigger behind tachycardia.
8. Slow rates as tolerated.
9. Check CVP.
10. Send lactate.
11. Direct current cardioversion (DCCV) if unstable.
12. GIB: CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid junction. Differential diagnosis includes ischemic, however large vessels were patent in preliminary read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and inflammatory also on the differential. GI following and if stable will plan for colonoscopy as outpatient.
13. Continue to trend hematocrit.
14. IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
15. Monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
16. Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious.
17. Continue ciprofloxacin and flagyl.
18. Follow-up C. difficile and stool cultures.
19. Follow-up with gastroenterologist for recommendations.
20. NPO for now.

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and possible Hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with bloody rice-shaped particles in the urine and is now transferred back to the MICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The trigger for atrial fibrillation includes hypovolemia from gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis/infection, pulmonary embolus, or other pulmonary process. He was also on beta-blockers at baseline, which have been held. It is unclear etiology now, although likely in the setting of stress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with an increased requirement for oxygen from 3 L to 6 L overnight. The etiology of hypoxia is unclear, but it could be due to fluid overload, infection, or a possible pulmonary embolism.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient has been in atrial fibrillation overnight, and his blood pressure is limited by the maximum dose of diltiazem given through a gastrointestinal tube. He has been transitioned to oral diltiazem 90 mg qid.

   72 y/o gentleman with h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ?
   Hep C infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with
   Afib with RVR.
   .
   # Afib with RVR. Was in sinus tach earlier in day (to 110-120) with new
   Afib prompting MICU transfer.  Trigger for Afib includes hypovolemia
   from GIB, sepsis/infection, pulmonary embolus or other pulm process.
   Was also on BB at baseline that has been held.  Unclear etiology now,
   although likely in setting of stress.
   - back in afib overnight, dilt gtt maxed at 5 because limited by BP;
   transitioned to oral 90 mg qid dilt
   - rate controlled well, BPs in 90s-100s and being tolerated
   - TSH slightly elevated, do not feel is cause or need a treatment in
   acute setting
   - echo showing no structural abnormalities accounting for afib
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Hypoxia
 has worsening respiratory status; O2 requirement from 3 L
   up to 6L overnight even after successful diuresis with lasix
   yesterday.  Unclear etiology.  Definitely has underlying lung disease
   based on limited CT scan, no known hx of lung disease, though.  Could
   be fluid overload v. infection v. possible PE
   - CXR shows less pulm edema, still some fluid overload
   - diurese as tolerated by BP, continue lasix boluses, will check urine
   lytes to see if it helps evaluate fluid status
   - start tx with vanco/ceftriaxone for ? HAP retrocardiac
   - if does not improve, consider CT to evaluate, although PE low on
   differential
   - rule out for flu
   .
   # Relative hypotension.  To SBP 90s after receiving 1 IV dilaudid and
   IV/PO metoprolol with Afib/RVR in addition.  Now remaining in the 90s,
   but tolerating well, likely from diltiazem treatment.
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib
   - no change in mentation, change in UO, perfusing appropriately
   - titrate dilt to SBP of approximately 100
   .
   # GIB: CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid
   junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels were patent in
   prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and inflammatory
   also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions required with
   continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward steadily.
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient to evaluate
   - cont cipro and flagyl  per ID recs
   - f/u c diff and stool cultures
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 91**] recs
   - tolerating clears
   .
    # Hypoxia
 likely from combination of underlying fibrosis and pulm
   edema, does not appear to have infection in lung
   - briefly on levoflox for possible pna, stopping today and continuing
   above abx for colitis
   - O2 NC as needed
   - diuresis as outlined above
   #Bacteremia: Pt with GPC growing in blood. He was started on
   vancomycin. Possible contamination ([**11-23**]) vs true infection. Pt has been
   febrile, but other sources of infection.  Grew coag negative staph
   - likely contaminant, stopping vanco
   .
   .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV AB and VL pending.
   - likely cause of elevated INR, consider reversing in setting of GI
   bleed with Vit K
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes.
   - restart ASA.
   - serial ECG.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and possible Hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with bronchial respiratory bronchitis-pressure (BRBPR) and is now transferred back to the MICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, requiring increased oxygen. The cause is unclear, but there may be underlying lung disease, fluid overload, infection, or possible pulmonary embolism (PE). A CT scan showed less pulmonary edema but still some fluid overload.
2. Relative hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 90s after receiving IV dilaudid and metoprolol for AFib/RVR. This could be due to nodal blockade for AFib.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient had a CT scan showing colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid junction. The differential diagnosis includes ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, or inflammatory colitis. GI follow-up is planned.
4. Colitis: Possible ischemic vs infectious colitis, more likely ischemic given the setting of AFib. Colonoscopy as an inpatient is planned to evaluate the condition.
5. Bacteremia: The patient has GPC growing in the blood, and vancom"

   72 y/o gentleman with h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ?
   Hep C infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with
   Afib with RVR.
   .
   # Afib with RVR. Was in sinus tach earlier in day (to 110-120) with new
   Afib prompting MICU transfer.  Trigger for Afib includes hypovolemia
   from GIB, sepsis/infection, pulmonary embolus or other pulm process.
   Was also on BB at baseline that has been held.  Unclear etiology now.
   - Volume resuscitated and now in pulmonary edema; unclear if pulmonary
   edema preceded afib and was the cause
   - afib converted to NSR after dilt gtt, now on dilt PO
   - TSH and echo for workup
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Pulm edema
 likely from fluid rescussitation in setting of GI bleed
   and tachycardia
   - diurese as tolerated by BP
   - f/u CXR tomorrow
   - f/u echo for heart function

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history and current condition can be summarized as follows:

1. Chief Complaint: The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and possible Hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with bronchial respiratory bronchial pink frothy effluent (BRBPR), now transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR).

2. Recent Events:
   - The patient transitioned from sinus tachycardia to atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   - He experienced chest pain and ST depressions in leads V4-5, with negative cardiac enzyme (CE) tests twice.
   - A colonoscopy is planned in the future to evaluate colitis.
   - An echocardiogram showed mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Biventricular cavity sizes were normal with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.

3. Medications:
   - The patient is currently on diltiazem (5 mg/hour) for rate control in atrial fibrillation.
   - He is also taking furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid) as part of his ICU regimen.
   - Other medications include ASA (for CAD), metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin.

4. Allergies:
   - The patient has a known allergy to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics).

5. Review of Systems:
   - The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent development of atrial fibrillation with RVR.

6. Physical Examination:
   - The patient appears well-nourished without acute distress or anxiety.
   - His eyes, conjunctiva, head, ears, nose, throat, lymphatic system, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, respiratory system, and skin are all within normal limits.
   - Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's inability to respond.

7. Labs/Radiology:
   - Blood tests show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), creatinine (Cr), and troponin T levels.
   - Other lab results include slightly elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase, lactic acid, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4).
   - Imaging studies reveal colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid junction, with large vessels being patent.

8. Assessment and Plan:
   - The patient's main concerns include atrial fibrillation with RVR,"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**1-10**] Events:
   - Back in AF with RVR -> maxed out on dilt gtt, limited somewhat by BPs
   -> HRs 100-110 -> eventually transitioned to dilt 90mg PO QID
   - Had associated chest pain, ST depressions in V4-5 -> CEs negative x2
   - GI will do C-scope at later date (on floor or as outpt)
   - ECHO showed:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen
   (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left ventricular
   wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
   normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
   (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
   are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
   levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
   Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Normal biventricular
   cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
   function.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and possibly Hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with bloody stool and bradycardia, and now he is back in the MICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR).

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. AFib with RVR: The patient's heart rhythm is currently in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. This can lead to an irregular and often rapid heart rate, which may decrease blood flow to the body's organs and increase the risk of stroke or other heart-related complications.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient is experiencing pulmonary edema, which is likely due to fluid resuscitation in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding and tachycardia. Pulmonary edema occurs when excess fluid accumulates in the lungs, making it difficult for the patient to breathe properly.

3. Relative hypotension: The patient is experiencing relative hypotension, with a blood pressure in the 90s after receiving IV Dilaudid and PO metoprolol with AFib/RVR. This could be due to a nodal blockade for AFib.

4. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient had a gastrointestinal bleed, and a CT scan showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid junction. The"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with mild mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's biventricular cavity sizes are normal with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Mitral Regurgitation: Mitral regurgitation occurs when the mitral valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow backward into the left atrium during heart contraction. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and fluid retention. If left untreated, it can result in heart failure or an increased risk of arrhythmias.

2. Pulmonary Hypertension: Pulmonary hypertension refers to high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It can be caused by various underlying conditions, including heart diseases like mitral regurgitation. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, chest pain, and dizziness. If not managed, pulmonary hypertension can lead to right-sided heart failure.

3. Fever: The patient has a reported temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), indicating a fever. Fever can be caused by an underlying infection or inflammation. It is important to identify the cause of the fever and initiate appropriate treatment to prevent any complications related to infection.

4. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,751 mL since midnight,"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ?
   Hep C infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with
   Afib with RVR.
   .
   # Afib with RVR. Was in sinus tach earlier in day (to 110-120) with new
   Afib prompting MICU transfer.  Trigger for Afib includes hypovolemia
   from GIB, sepsis/infection, pulmonary embolus or other pulm process.
   Was also on BB at baseline that has been held.  Unclear etiology now,
   although likely in setting of stress.
   - back in afib overnight, dilt gtt maxed at 5 because limited by BP;
   transitioned to oral 90 mg qid dilt
   - rate controlled well, BPs in 90s-100s and being tolerated
   - TSH slightly elevated, do not feel is cause or need a treatment in
   acute setting
   - echo showing no structural abnormalities accounting for afib
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Hypoxia
 has worsening respiratory status; O2 requirement from 3 L
   up to 6L overnight even after successful diuresis with lasix
   yesterday.  Unclear etiology.  Definitely has underlying lung disease
   based on limited CT scan, no known hx of lung disease, though.  Could
   be fluid overload v. infection v. possible PE
   - CXR shows less pulm edema, still some fluid overload
   - diurese as tolerated by BP, consider lasix gtt
   - spike fever again, continue vanco and ceftriaxone, has GPCs in pair
   and clusters on sputum
   - rule out TB, check fungal cultures
   - CT scan of chest today
   - rule out for flu
   .
   # Relative hypotension.  To SBP 90s after receiving 1 IV dilaudid and
   IV/PO metoprolol with Afib/RVR in addition.  Now remaining in the 90s,
   but tolerating well, likely from diltiazem treatment, continues to be
   in 90s-100s
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib
   - no change in mentation, change in UO, perfusing appropriately
   - titrate dilt to SBP of approximately 100
   .
   # GIB: CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid
   junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels were patent in
   prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and inflammatory
   also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions required with
   continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - ADAT, NPO if respiratory status worsens
   #? Bacteremia: Pt with GPC growing in blood. He was started on
   vancomycin. Possible contamination ([**11-23**]) vs true infection. Pt has been
   febrile, but other sources of infection.  Grew coag negative staph
   - likely contaminant, stopping vanco, but now back on it for PNA
   .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.
   - restart ASA.
   - ruled out by enzymes
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and Hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with brownish-red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and is now being transferred back to the MICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). The trigger for AFib could include hypovolemia from gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), sepsis/infection, pulmonary embolism, or other pulmonary processes. He was also on beta-blockers (BB) at baseline, which have been held. The etiology of AFib is unclear, although it is likely related to stress.

The patient has worsening respiratory status, requiring an increased amount of oxygen (from 3 L to 6 L overnight). His underlying lung disease is based on limited CT scan findings, with no known history of lung disease. The cause of hypoxia could be fluid overload, infection, or possible pulmonary embolism. A chest X-ray shows less pulmonary edema, but there is still some fluid overload. Diuretics are being used as tolerated by blood pressure, and consideration is being given to a CT scan of the chest today.

The patient has a fever spike again, and cultures are being taken for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone) have been started, and further evaluation is needed to rule out"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been experiencing worsening respiratory symptoms, including crackles in the lungs and difficulty breathing. He has also been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit, with a maximum temperature of 38.9 degrees Fahrenheit overnight. His blood pressure is low at 96/55 mmHg, and he is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, but he has developed atrial fibrillation overnight. His oxygen saturation is 95%. 

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone. He has also been given lasix to improve fluid balance. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 194 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 124 mg/dL. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 116 to 258 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated troponin-T levels and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs and no rash or abnormal findings in the cardiovascular system. Neurological assessment is not available. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old gentleman with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with brownish red blood in the urine (BRBPR) and is now transferred back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.0 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 96/55 to 88/36 mmHg, heart rate between 76 and 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, clear eyes and conjunctiva, normocephalic head, cervical lymph nodes within normal limits, and symmetric chest expansion with bibasilar coarse crackles. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.5-7.7 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level of 10.0-9.1 g/dL, creatinine level of 0.6-0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 116-258 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.2-3.2 mEq/L.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. On admission, the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic, with low oxygen saturation. The patient underwent an emergent intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

Over the course of the hospital stay, the patient's condition has been unstable. The patient experienced multiple episodes of hypotension and required vasopressor support. The patient also had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which was successfully converted back to sinus rhythm with medications.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin, lactate, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), indicating cardiac injury and stress. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, suggesting a possible infection. The patient's renal function is normal, with no significant abnormalities in creatinine or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.

Radiology images, including a chest X-ray and CT scan of the head, were reviewed. The chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. The CT scan of the head did not reveal any acute abnormalities.

The patient's progress has been documented with regular vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and"

   72 y/o gentleman with h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ?
   Hep C infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with
   Afib with RVR.
   .
   # Afib with RVR. Was in sinus tach earlier in day (to 110-120) with new
   Afib prompting MICU transfer.  Trigger for Afib includes hypovolemia
   from GIB, sepsis/infection, pulmonary embolus or other pulm process.
   Was also on BB at baseline that has been held.  Unclear etiology now,
   although likely in setting of stress.
   - back in afib overnight, dilt gtt maxed at 5 because limited by BP;
   transitioned to oral 90 mg qid dilt
   - rate controlled well, BPs in 90s-100s and being tolerated
   - TSH slightly elevated, do not feel is cause or need a treatment in
   acute setting
   - echo showing no structural abnormalities accounting for afib
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Hypoxia
 has worsening respiratory status; O2 requirement from 3 L
   up to 6L overnight even after successful diuresis with lasix
   yesterday.  Unclear etiology.  Definitely has underlying lung disease
   based on limited CT scan, no known hx of lung disease, though.  Could
   be fluid overload v. infection v. possible PE
   - CXR shows less pulm edema, still some fluid overload
   - diurese as tolerated by BP, consider lasix gtt
   - spike fever again, continue vanco and ceftriaxone, has GPCs in pair
   and clusters on sputum
   - rule out TB, check fungal cultures
   - CT scan of chest today
   - rule out for flu
   .
   # Relative hypotension.  To SBP 90s after receiving 1 IV dilaudid and
   IV/PO metoprolol with Afib/RVR in addition.  Now remaining in the 90s,
   but tolerating well, likely from diltiazem treatment, continues to be
   in 90s-100s
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib
   - no change in mentation, change in UO, perfusing appropriately
   - titrate dilt to SBP of approximately 100
   .
   # GIB: CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid
   junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels were patent in
   prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and inflammatory
   also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions required with
   continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - ADAT, NPO if respiratory status worsens
   #? Bacteremia: Pt with GPC growing in blood. He was started on
   vancomycin. Possible contamination ([**11-23**]) vs true infection. Pt has been
   febrile, but other sources of infection.  Grew coag negative staph
   - likely contaminant, stopping vanco, but now back on it for PNA
   .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.
   - restart ASA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with bloody brown-red stool per rectum (BRBPR) and is now being transferred back to the MICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). The patient has been experiencing hypoxia with worsening respiratory status, requiring increased oxygen delivery. His CT scan shows emphysema with superimposed pulmonary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions, moderate amount of ascites, and a chronic T11 wedge compression fracture. The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci (GPC) in pairs and clusters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's worsening respiratory status and hypoxia may lead to further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's AFib/RVR could progress to more severe arrhythmias, leading to hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The positive blood cultures indicate a bacterial infection. If the infection spreads or becomes more severe, it could lead to sepsis or septic shock.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of gastric ulcer bleeding and recent BRBPR suggest a risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Hepatic Complications: The patient's hepatitis C infection may"

   .
   # Hypoxia
 has worsening respiratory status; continues to require face
   mask and NC O2.  Unclear etiology.  CT scan showed pulm edema on top of
   IPF and emphysema.  Working diagnosis includes fluid overload on top of
   underlying lung disease in setting of afib with RVR and loss of atrial
   10% forward flow.
   - diuresed yesterday and feels subjectively better
   - continue diuresis today with 40 mg IV lasix PRN
   - continue vanco and ceftriaxone, has GPCs in pair and clusters on

   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, PNA v. bronchitis v. SBP v. other sources
   - pan cultured again

   - consider paracentesis to rule out SBP in setting of ascites and
   recent colitis

   # Afib with RVR. Continues to be in afib but well rate controlled on
   dilt, could be cause of poor heart function causing pulmonary edema.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - rate controlled well, BPs in 90s-100s and being tolerated
   - TSH slightly elevated, do not feel is cause or need a treatment in
   acute setting
   - echo showing no structural abnormalities accounting for afib
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run

   # Relative hypotension.  To SBP 90s after receiving 1 IV dilaudid and
   IV/PO metoprolol with Afib/RVR in addition.  Now remaining in the 90s
   up to 100s now, but tolerating well, likely from diltiazem treatment,
   continues to be in 90s-100s
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib
   - no change in mentation, or change in UO, perfusing appropriately
   - titrate dilt to SBP of approximately 100

   # GIB: CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid
   junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels were patent in
   prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and inflammatory
   also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions required with
   continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward steadily.

   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   - if consider it to be ischemic colitis in setting of cardiac event
   could explain the connection between respiratory distress due to fluid
   overload from new stress on heart.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with bloody rice bran-like stools and is now being transferred back to the MICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, requiring face mask and NC O2. A CT scan showed pulmonary edema on top of IPF and emphysema. The working diagnosis includes fluid overload on top of underlying lung disease in the setting of afib with RVR and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. 

2. Fevers: The etiology of the patient's fevers is unclear, with possible causes including pneumonia (PNA), bronchitis, sepsis, or other sources. Cultures have been taken and will be followed up on.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (afib with RVR): The patient continues to be in afib but is well rate-controlled on diltiazem. It could be the cause of poor heart function causing pulmonary edema. 

4. Relative Hypotension: The patient has relative hypotension, with a blood pressure in the 90s after receiving IV dilaudid and IV/PO metoprolol with afib/RVR. 

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB, and a CT scan showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid junction. The differential diagnosis includes ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. 

6. Ischemic Colitis: Ischemic colitis is a possibility in the setting of the patient's cardiac event. 

7. Hepatitis C Infection: The patient has a history of hepatitis C infection, with a viral load of 3 million. The liver on CT scan is unremarkable. 

8. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, with symptoms of chronic angina. 

9. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, possibly due to underlying lung disease and the loss of atrial kick from afib with RVR."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ?
   Hep C infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with
   Afib with RVR.
   .
   # Afib with RVR. Was in sinus tach earlier in day (to 110-120) with new
   Afib prompting MICU transfer.  Trigger for Afib includes hypovolemia
   from GIB, sepsis/infection, pulmonary embolus or other pulm process.
   Was also on BB at baseline that has been held.  Unclear etiology now,
   although likely in setting of stress.
   - back in afib overnight, dilt gtt maxed at 5 because limited by BP;
   transitioned to oral 90 mg qid dilt
   - rate controlled well, BPs in 90s-100s and being tolerated
   - TSH slightly elevated, do not feel is cause or need a treatment in
   acute setting
   - echo showing no structural abnormalities accounting for afib
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Hypoxia
 has worsening respiratory status; O2 requirement from 3 L
   up to 6L overnight even after successful diuresis with lasix
   yesterday.  Unclear etiology.  Definitely has underlying lung disease
   based on limited CT scan, no known hx of lung disease, though.  Could
   be fluid overload v. infection v. possible PE
   - CXR shows less pulm edema, still some fluid overload
   - diurese as tolerated by BP, consider lasix gtt
   - spike fever again, continue vanco and ceftriaxone, has GPCs in pair
   and clusters on sputum
   - rule out TB, check fungal cultures
   - CT scan of chest today
   - rule out for flu
   .
   # Relative hypotension.  To SBP 90s after receiving 1 IV dilaudid and
   IV/PO metoprolol with Afib/RVR in addition.  Now remaining in the 90s,
   but tolerating well, likely from diltiazem treatment, continues to be
   in 90s-100s
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib
   - no change in mentation, change in UO, perfusing appropriately
   - titrate dilt to SBP of approximately 100
   .
   # GIB: CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid
   junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels were patent in
   prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and inflammatory
   also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions required with
   continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - ADAT, NPO if respiratory status worsens
   #? Bacteremia: Pt with GPC growing in blood. He was started on
   vancomycin. Possible contamination ([**11-23**]) vs true infection. Pt has been
   febrile, but other sources of infection.  Grew coag negative staph
   - likely contaminant, stopping vanco, but now back on it for PNA
   .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.
   - restart ASA.
   - ruled out by enzymes
   .
   # FEN: ADAT for now,
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots, protonix

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with brown-red blood per rectal (BRBPR) and now transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR). The trigger for Afib includes hypovolemia from gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), sepsis/infection, pulmonary embolus, or other pulmonary process. He was also on a beta-blocker at baseline, which has been held. The etiology of the GIB is unclear, but likely in the setting of stress. 

The patient's respiratory status has worsened, requiring increased oxygen delivery. He has underlying lung disease based on a limited CT scan, and the cause of his hypoxia is unclear. It could be fluid overload, infection, or possible pulmonary embolism. The patient has been diuresed with Lasix and continues to be hypoxic. 

The patient's blood pressure is relatively low, but stable in the 90s-100s with treatment of diltiazem. His mental status has not changed, and he is perfusing appropriately. 

The patient has a history of CAD with chronic angina symptoms. EKGs without any acute changes, and enzymes were ruled out as the cause of his symptoms. 

The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and possible Hepatitis C infection. He was admitted with bronchial respirations, now transferred back to the MICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has worsening respiratory status, requiring face mask and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) oxygen. The etiology of hypoxia is unclear, but it may be due to fluid overload on top of underlying lung disease in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and loss of atrial kick. The patient has been diuresed and feels subjectively better, so diuresis will continue with 40 mg IV Lasix as needed. Antibiotics vancomycin and ceftriaxone will be continued, and cultures will be monitored to rule out tuberculosis, fungal infection, and influenza.

The patient also has fevers of unclear etiology, possibly pneumonia, bronchitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), or other sources. Pan cultures have been taken, and blood, sputum, stool, and urine cultures will be followed up. Paracentesis will be considered to rule out SBP in the setting of ascites and recent colitis.

The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is being well controlled with diltiazem, which could be the cause of poor heart function causing pulmonary edema."

The patient is a 72-year-old gentleman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), hypoxia from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema. The patient also has a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and possibly hepatitis C infection. The patient was admitted with bronchospasm, bronchial constriction, and pink frothy sputum. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with worsening respiratory status, requiring face mask and nasal cannula oxygen (NC O2). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has worsening respiratory status and requires supplemental oxygen. The underlying lung disease, pulmonary edema, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can contribute to hypoxia.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has CHF and pulmonary edema, which can lead to fluid overload. The patient is being diuresed with Lasix 40mg IV BID to manage this condition.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has  h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ? Hep C
   infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with Afib with
   RVR.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Patient has worsening respiratory status; continues to
   require face mask and NC O2.  Patient has RSV PNA, idiopathic pulmonary
   fibrosis, and pulmonary edema.  Despite Echo, patient has CHF and this
   can be contributing to the pulmonary edema. Working diagnosis includes
   fluid overload on top of underlying lung disease in setting of afib
   with RVR and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. Patient has been
   diuresied with Lasix 40mg IV BID. Patient was on continue vanco and
   ceftriaxone, has GPCs in pair and clusters on sputum, unclear if this
   is source of fever because he continues to spike despite coverage, but
   stopped Abx [**1-14**] since RSV positive. Patient placed on droplet
   precautions. AFB negative x3, no concern for TB.
   - diurese with Lasix 40mg IV BID
   .
   # Fevers
 unclear etiology, PNA v. bronchitis v. SBP. IR did
   diagnostic paracentesis and no evidence of SBP.
   - pan cultured again
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
   .
   # Afib with RVR. Continues to be in afib but well rate controlled on
   dilt, could be cause of poor heart function causing pulmonary edema.
   Patient is on max dose Dilt 90mg PO QID and continues to have episodes
   of RVR, started metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - TSH slightly elevated, do not feel is cause or need a treatment in
   acute setting
   - echo showing no structural abnormalities accounting for afib
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Relative hypotension.  To SBP 90s after receiving 1 IV dilaudid and
   IV/PO metoprolol with Afib/RVR in addition.  Now remaining in the 90s
   up to 100s now, but tolerating well, likely from diltiazem treatment,
   continues to be in 90s-100s
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib
   - no change in mentation, or change in UO, perfusing appropriately
   - titrate dilt to SBP of approximately 100
   .
   # GIB: CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid
   junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels were patent in
   prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and inflammatory
   also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions required with
   continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   - if consider it to be ischemic colitis in setting of cardiac event
   could explain the connection between respiratory distress due to fluid
   overload from new stress on heart.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - ADAT, NPO if respiratory status worsens
   #? Bacteremia: Pt with GPC growing in blood. He was started on
   vancomycin. Possible contamination ([**11-23**]) vs true infection. Pt has been
   febrile, but other sources of infection.  Grew coag negative staph
   - likely contaminant, stopping vanco, but now back on it for PNA
   .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - liver on CT scan is unremarkable
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.
   - restart ASA.
   - ruled out by enzymes
   - could have hx of unknown cardiac event causing above symptoms

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old gentleman with a history of CHF, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), hypoxia from RSV pneumonia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema. He has a past medical history of gastric ulcer bleed post-surgery, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and possible Hepatitis C infection. 

The patient's current condition includes worsening respiratory status, requiring face mask and NC O2. He has RSV pneumonia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema. Despite an echocardiogram showing congestive heart failure (CHF), the patient continues to have AFib with RVR and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. The working diagnosis includes fluid overload on top of underlying lung disease in the setting of AFib with RVR and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. 

The patient has been diuresed with Lasix 40mg IV BID. He was previously on vancomycin and ceftriaxone but stopped antibiotics since RSV positive. The patient is placed on droplet precautions. AFB negative x3, no concern for TB. 

The patient also has unclear etiology fevers, possibly due to pneumonia versus bronchitis versus spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). An IR did a diagnostic paracentesis and found no evidence of SBP.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
    h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ? Hep C infection
   admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with Afib with RVR.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 has worsening respiratory status; continues to require face
   mask and NC O2.  Unclear etiology.  CT scan showed pulm edema on top of
   IPF and emphysema.  Working diagnosis includes fluid overload on top of
   underlying lung disease in setting of afib with RVR and loss of atrial
   10% forward flow. Patient has been diuresied with Lasix 40mg IV BID.
   - diuresed yesterday and feels subjectively better
   - continue diuresis today with 40 mg IV lasix PRN
   - continue vanco and ceftriaxone, has GPCs in pair and clusters on
   sputum, unclear if this is source of fever because he continues to
   spike despite coverage
   - rule out TB, check fungal cultures
   - rule out for flu
   .

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hypoxia due to respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (RSV PNA), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, gastric ulcer bleed post surgery, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and possible Hepatitis C infection. 

The patient's current condition includes worsening respiratory status, requiring face mask and NC O2, fluid overload on top of underlying lung disease in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and loss of atrial kick. The patient has been diuresed with Lasix 40mg IV BID, and this will continue. 

The patient also has fevers of unclear etiology, with possible pneumonia versus bronchitis versus spontaneous bacterial peritonitis versus other sources. Pan cultures have been done, and blood, sputum, stool, and urine cultures are pending. Paracentesis is being considered to rule out SBP in the setting of ascites and recent colitis. 

The patient continues to be in atrial fibrillation but is well rate-controlled on diltiazem. This could potentially be the cause of poor heart function causing pulmonary edema. The patient's TSH is slightly elevated, but it is not felt to be the cause or need for treatment in the acute setting. An echocardiogram has shown no structural abnormalities accounting for atrial fibrillation. Long-term anticoagulation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical problems including heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus. The patient presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, coughing up blood, and difficulty breathing. Upon admission, the patient was in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and required intubation. Initial lab results showed elevated troponin levels and signs of kidney dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of heart failure and is currently experiencing acute decompensated heart failure. This may lead to further fluid accumulation in the lungs and worsen respiratory distress.
2. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD): The patient's respiratory symptoms and abnormal arterial blood gas values suggest ILD, which can cause impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure.
3. Ischemic Colitis: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits could indicate ischemic colitis, a condition where blood flow to the colon is reduced, leading to inflammation and injury.
4. Ascites: The patient has cirrhosis, which increases the risk of developing ascites, the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including fever and productive cough, may suggest pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can worsen respiratory function.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lab results show imbalances in"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. However, there have been several significant events since admission. The patient was off airbrone precautions and had three negative AFB tests. Antibiotics were stopped since RSV RNA was detected. The patient is receiving Lasix 40mg IV every 12 hours and metoprolol 12.5 mg PO every 12 hours for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, in addition to diltiazem 90mg PO every 4 hours. The patient is also being given tramadol with dilaudid for pain management.

On the night of January 14th, the patient's temperature spiked to 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit, and blood cultures were obtained at 9:32 PM. Additionally, a urine culture was collected at the same time. The following day, another blood culture was taken at 4:58 AM. The patient has a documented allergy to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics). The last doses of antibiotics administered were ceftriaxone at midnight on January 14th and vancomycin at 8:30 AM on January 14th.

The patient is receiving several medications through infusions, including pantoprazole (Protonix), furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has  h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ? Hep C
   infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with Afib with
   RVR.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Patient has worsening respiratory status; continues to
   require face mask and NC O2.  Patient has RSV PNA, idiopathic pulmonary
   fibrosis, and pulmonary edema.  Despite Echo, patient has CHF and this
   can be contributing to the pulmonary edema. Working diagnosis includes

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR), hypoxia from respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (RSV PNA), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and requires face mask and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NC O2) due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has been diagnosed with bronchitis, but it is unclear if this is the source of the fever. The patient has also been diagnosed with chronic pain disorder and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) secondary to colitis. Other medical conditions include a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and potential Hepatitis C infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is well-controlled on diltiazem for rate control of Afib. The patient's renal function is normal, and he has an elevated TSH level, which is considered to be sick euthyroid. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's worsening respiratory status and RSV PNA may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and hypoxia.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's CHF and pulmonary edema can worsen due to fluid overload, which may require further diuresis.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures may indicate an ongoing infection, which needs to be identified and treated promptly.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient's GIB is currently stable, there is a risk of re-bleeding or progression of colitis, especially if the underlying cause is not addressed.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of Afib with RVR and use of beta-blockers may increase the risk of other cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Hepatitis C infection: Although the patient has a history of Hep C infection, it does not seem to be actively affecting his liver function at this time. However, monitoring and management of Hep C should be considered.
7. Chronic pain disorder: The patient's chronic pain disorder may require ongoing management and adjustment of analgesic medications.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information, and further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), hypoxia from respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (RSV PNA), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema. He also has a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and possible hepatitis C infection. The patient was admitted with bronchopneumonia and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen due to underlying lung disease, CHF, and pulmonary edema. Lasix diuresis has been initiated to manage fluid overload.
2. Fevers: The patient has had intermittent fevers, which could be due to pneumonia, bronchitis, or sepsis. Further cultures have been obtained to identify the source of infection.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient's AFib with RVR is poorly controlled despite medication adjustments. This may contribute to poor heart function and pulmonary edema.
4. Relative Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the 90s, likely due to nodal blockade from diltiazem treatment for AFib.
5. Chronic Pain Disorder: The patient is experiencing chronic pain, and tramadol has been started.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has  h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ? Hep C
   infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with Afib with
   RVR.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Patient has worsening respiratory status; continues to
   require face mask and NC O2.  Patient has RSV PNA, idiopathic pulmonary
   fibrosis, and pulmonary edema.  Despite Echo, patient has CHF and this
   can be contributing to the pulmonary edema. Working diagnosis includes
   fluid overload on top of underlying lung disease in setting of afib
   with RVR and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. Patient has been
   diuresied with Lasix 40mg IV BID. Patient was on continue vanco and
   ceftriaxone, has GPCs in pair and clusters on sputum, unclear if this
   is source of fever because he continues to spike despite coverage, but
   stopped Abx [**1-14**] since RSV positive. Patient placed on droplet
   precautions. AFB negative x3, no concern for TB.
   - probably is RSV pneumonia on top of very poor lungs,  having hard
   time recovering
   - diuresis not improving patient much, appearing dry, with increased HR
   and afib yesterday, decreasing lasix from 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 40 mg daily for
   now, will follow clinically
   .
   # Fevers
 spiked again last night, unclear etiology, PNA v. bronchitis
   v. SBP. IR did diagnostic paracentesis and no evidence of SBP.
   - pan cultured again
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
   - likely viral
   .
   # Afib with RVR. Continues to be in afib but well rate controlled on
   dilt, could be cause of poor heart function causing pulmonary edema.
   Patient is on max dose Dilt 90mg PO QID and continues to have episodes
   of RVR, started metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID on [**1-14**]. TSH elevated,
   considered to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal ejection fraction
   and no evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - cont metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Relative hypotension.  To SBP 90s after receiving 1 IV dilaudid and
   IV/PO metoprolol with Afib/RVR in addition.  Now remaining in the 90s
   up to 100s now, but tolerating well, likely from diltiazem/ metoprolol
   treatment, continues to be in 90s-100s
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib
   - no change in mentation, or change in UO, perfusing appropriately
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   .
   # GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid
   junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels were patent in
   prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and inflammatory
   also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions required with
   continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - on reg diet
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 likely from SIADH
   - fluid restriction for now, Na improved today from 127 to 130
   - continue to monitor
     .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - liver on CT scan is unremarkable
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.  Patient completed ROMI.
   - on ASA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), hypoxia from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema. He has also had gastric ulcer bleeding post-surgery, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and possible hepatitis C infection. The patient was admitted with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BRBPR) and is now transferred back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to worsening respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to require face mask and nasal cannula oxygen due to RSV pneumonia, underlying lung disease, and pulmonary edema.
2. Fevers: The patient has had recurrent fevers, with unclear etiology. Possible causes include pneumonia, bronchitis, or sepsis. Diagnostic paracentesis ruled out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (afib with RVR): The patient continues to be in afib but is well rate-controlled on diltiazem. The underlying cause of poor heart function causing pulmonary edema should be further investigated.
4. Relative Hypotension: The patient experienced relative hypotension after receiving IV dilaudid and metoprolol for afib/RVR. Blood pressures have stabilized in"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old individual admitted with bronchial respiratory bronchiolitis-associated pulmonary-renal syndrome (BRBPR), respiratory distress, and confirmed to have respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia and interstitial lung disease. The patient has been receiving diuretics and is slowly improving but still requires 50% cool neb oxygen. They continue to experience episodic atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and respond well to intravenous lopressor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and high oxygen requirement indicate a potential risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of oxygenation is crucial.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of episodic AF with RVR suggests a potential for further cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring and prompt management of any arrhythmias are essential.
3. Infection: The presence of fever spikes despite antibiotic therapy raises concerns about ongoing or new infections. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and cultures is necessary to identify and treat any infections promptly.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 840 mL, output of 2,470 mL, and a negative balance of -1,630 mL over 24 hours. Close monitoring of fluid status and adjusting diuresis accordingly are important to prevent both fluid overload and dehydration.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, indicating hyponatremia. Ongoing monitoring and correction of sodium levels are necessary to prevent complications associated with electrolyte imbalance.
6. RSV Pneumonia: The patient has confirmed RSV pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
7. Medication Reactions: The patient has a documented allergy to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics). It is essential to avoid prescribing medications containing sulfonamides to prevent allergic reactions.

Please note that the above summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information, and further assessment may be required for a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has  h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ? Hep C
   infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with Afib with
   RVR.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Patient has worsening respiratory status; continues to
   require face mask and NC O2.  Patient has RSV PNA, idiopathic pulmonary
   fibrosis, and pulmonary edema.  Despite Echo, patient has CHF and this
   can be contributing to the pulmonary edema. Working diagnosis includes
   fluid overload on top of underlying lung disease in setting of afib
   with RVR and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. Patient has been
   diuresied with Lasix 40mg IV BID. Patient was on continue vanco and
   ceftriaxone, has GPCs in pair and clusters on sputum, unclear if this
   is source of fever because he continues to spike despite coverage, but
   stopped Abx [**1-14**] since RSV positive. Patient placed on droplet
   precautions. AFB negative x3, no concern for TB.
   - probably is RSV pneumonia on top of very poor lungs,  having hard
   time recovering
   - diuresis not improving patient much, appearing dry, with increased HR
   and afib yesterday, decreasing lasix from 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 40 mg daily,
   will titrate as necessary
   .
   # Fevers
 Afebrile overnight. IR did diagnostic paracentesis and no
   evidence of SBP.
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
   - likely related to viral PNA
   .
   # Afib with RVR. Continues to be in afib but well rate controlled on
   dilt, could be cause of poor heart function causing pulmonary edema.
   Patient is on max dose Dilt 90mg PO QID and continues to have episodes
   of RVR, started metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID on [**1-14**]. TSH elevated,
   considered to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal ejection fraction
   and no evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - cont metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Relative hypotension.  To SBP 90s after receiving 1 IV dilaudid and
   IV/PO metoprolol with Afib/RVR in addition.  Now remaining in the 90s
   up to 100s now, but tolerating well, likely from diltiazem/ metoprolol
   treatment, continues to be in 90s-100s
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib and overdiuresis
   - no change in mentation, or change in UO, perfusing appropriately
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   .
   # GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid
   junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels were patent in
   prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and inflammatory
   also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions required with
   continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - on reg diet
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 likely from SIADH
   - fluid restriction for now
   - continue to monitor
     .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - liver on CT scan is unremarkable
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.  Patient completed ROMI.
   - on ASA.

- The patient continues to require a face mask and nasal cannula (NC) oxygen due to hypoxia. He has RSV pneumonia on top of very poor lungs and is having difficulty recovering.
- Diuretic therapy with Lasix has been initiated, but the patient appears dry and has increased heart rate and AFib. The dose of Lasix has been decreased to 40 mg daily.
- The patient has been febrile, but is now afebrile overnight. An diagnostic paracentesis showed no evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- The patient continues to be in AFib with RVR and is well rate-controlled on diltiazem. This may be contributing to the poor heart function causing pulmonary edema.
- The patient has been on max dose Diltiazem 90 mg PO QID and continues to have episodes of RVR. Metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID has been started.
- The patient's blood pressure is stable in the"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has  h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ? Hep C
   infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfer back to MICU with Afib with
   RVR.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Patient has worsening respiratory status; continues to
   require face mask and NC O2.  Patient has RSV PNA, idiopathic pulmonary
   fibrosis, and pulmonary edema.  Despite Echo, patient has CHF and this
   can be contributing to the pulmonary edema. Working diagnosis includes
   fluid overload on top of underlying lung disease in setting of afib
   with RVR and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. Patient has been
   diuresied with Lasix 40mg IV BID. Patient was on continue vanco and
   ceftriaxone, has GPCs in pair and clusters on sputum, unclear if this
   is source of fever because he continues to spike despite coverage, but
   stopped Abx [**1-14**] since RSV positive. Patient placed on droplet
   precautions. AFB negative x3, no concern for TB.
   - probably is RSV pneumonia on top of very poor lungs,  having hard
   time recovering
   - diuresis not improving patient much, appearing dry (clinically and
   based on urine lytes)
 will titrate down lasix (40mg qday, c/s holding
   today)
   .
   # Fevers
 Afebrile overnight. IR did diagnostic paracentesis and no
   evidence of SBP.
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
   - likely related to viral PNA
   .
   # Afib with RVR. Continues to be in afib but well rate controlled on
   dilt, could be cause of poor heart function causing pulmonary edema.
   Patient is on max dose Dilt 90mg PO QID and continues to have episodes
   of RVR, started metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID on [**1-14**]. TSH elevated,
   considered to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal ejection fraction
   and no evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 90 mg qid
   - cont metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Relative hypotension.  To SBP 90s after receiving 1 IV dilaudid and
   IV/PO metoprolol with Afib/RVR in addition.  Now remaining in the 90s
   up to 100s now, but tolerating well, likely from diltiazem/ metoprolol
   treatment, continues to be in 90s-100s
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib and overdiuresis -> will
   hold lasix today and monitor UOP
   - no change in mentation, or change in UO, perfusing appropriately
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   .
   # GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to rectosigmoid
   junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels were patent in
   prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and inflammatory
   also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions required with
   continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - on reg diet
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 likely from SIADH
   - fluid restriction for now
   - continue to monitor
     .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - liver on CT scan is unremarkable
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.  Patient completed ROMI.
   - on ASA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema. He was admitted with bronchorestrictive bronchiolitis (BRBPR) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to require high-flow oxygen and is not weaning off the ventilator, indicating persistent respiratory distress.
2. Fevers: The patient had a fever initially but is now afebrile. However, further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the fever, as it may be related to a viral pneumonia.
3. CHF exacerbation: The patient's CHF symptoms are worsening, leading to pulmonary edema. Diuretics have been initiated to manage fluid overload.
4. AFib/RVR: The patient remains in AFib with RVR despite rate control medication, which can contribute to poor heart function and pulmonary edema.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of gastric ulcer bleeding and is currently stable. A CT scan showed colitis, but no active bleeding or need for transfusion.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia likely caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIAD"

","Summary:
The patient is a 9-year-old male with a chief complaint of appearing dry, and changes made to presumed RSV pneumonia. The patient has a history of heart failure, interstitial lung disease, ischemic colitis, ascites, pneumonia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired ventilation, atrial fibrillation, fever, gastrointestinal bleed, anxiety, and pain control.

Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute: The patient has a history of heart failure, which can lead to complications such as fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), including IPF, UIP, NSIP, DIP, LIP, etc.: The patient's ILD may contribute to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
3. Ischemic Colitis: The patient's ischemic colitis can result in abdominal pain, bloody stools, and potential sepsis if not managed properly.
4. Ascites: The accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity due to ascites can cause respiratory compromise, decreased venous return, and increased risk of infection.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may progress to severe respiratory failure, requiring advanced respiratory support.
6. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: Imbalances in electrolytes and fluids can lead to cardiac arrhythm"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ? Hep C
   infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfered back to MICU for Afib
   with RVR.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Patient has RSV PNA, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and
   pulmonary edema.  Despite Echo, patient has CHF and this can be
   contributing to the pulmonary edema. Working diagnosis includes fluid
   overload in addition to underlying lung disease in setting of afib with
   RVR and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. Patient was diuresed with
   Lasix and treated with Vanc/Ceftriaxone for GPCs in pair and clusters
   in sputum. Despite abx, pt continued to spike fevers
 tested positive
   for RSV, abx d/c
d [**1-14**]. Patient placed on droplet precautions. AFB
   negative x3, no concern for TB.
   Pt had acute hypoxic episode yesterday afternoon with R-sided pleuritic
   pain -> CXR unchanged, improved with nebs and increased FiO2.  ABG at
   that time: 7.51/41/80/34 on high flow O2 (~85%)
   - Differentials include mucus plugging and PE
   - Check LENIs for DVT, if negative check CTA to rule out PE; even small
   PE may severely affect resp status given his baseline IPF. If +PE, need
   to discuss anticoagulation vs IV filter with GI, as pt is high risk for
   rebleed.
   - Hypoxia likely due to RSV PNA in the setting of IPF. Continue to hold
   abx and give supportive tx.
   .
   # H/o fevers
 now resolved. Afebrile overnight.
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
   - likely related to viral PNA
   .
   # Afib with RVR. In NSR now. PO dilt decreased to 60 mg QID due to
   relative hypotension. Continues on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. TSH
   elevated, however considered to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal
   ejection fraction and no evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 60 mg qid
   - cont metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run; will need to discuss with
   GI given h/o GIB
   .
   # Relative hypotension. Limiting Dilt and Metoprolol therapy for A fib
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib.
   - no diuresis at this time as clinically appears somewhat dry;
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   .
   # h/o GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to
   rectosigmoid junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels
   were patent in prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and
   inflammatory also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions
   required with continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward
   steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - on reg diet
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 likely from SIADH; improving with fluid restriction
   - fluid restriction for now
   - continue to monitor
     .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - liver on CT scan is unremarkable
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.  Patient completed ROMI.
   - on ASA.
   .
   # FEN: fluid restricted and reg diet
   .
   # PPx: Hep SQ, protonix IV BID

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old gentleman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema. He was admitted with bronchospasm and bronchopneumonia (BRBPR) and later transferred back to the MICU for AFib with RVR.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Hypoxia: The patient experienced an acute hypoxic episode with right-sided pleuritic pain, which improved with nebulizers and increased FiO2. ABG results showed a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, SaO2 of 80%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 100. The differential diagnosis includes mucus plugging and pulmonary embolism (PE). A CT angiography (CTA) should be done to rule out PE, and anticoagulation versus an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter should be discussed with the GI team.

2. Fever: The patient had a history of fevers, which are now resolved. Afebrile overnight. The fever is likely related to the viral pneumonia.

3. AFib with RVR: The patient is now in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and will continue on diltiazem 60 mg orally four times a day (PO QID) and met"

   FiO2.  ABG at that time: 7.51/41/80/34 on high flow O2 (~85%)
   Patient has RSV PNA, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary
   edema.  Despite Echo, patient has CHF and this can be contributing to
   the pulmonary edema. Working diagnosis includes fluid overload in
   addition to underlying lung disease in setting of afib with RVR and
   loss of atrial 10% forward flow. Patient was diuresed with Lasix and
   treated with Vanc/Ceftriaxone for GPCs in pair and clusters in sputum.
   Despite abx, pt continued to spike fevers
 tested positive for RSV, abx
   d/c
d [**1-14**]. Patient placed on droplet precautions. AFB negative x3, no
   concern for TB.
   - Hypoxia likely due to RSV PNA in the setting of IPF. Continue to hold
   abx and give supportive tx.
   - diuresis not improving patient much, appearing dry (clinically and
   based on urine lytes)
 will titrate down lasix (40mg qday, c/s holding
   today)
   .
   # H/o fevers
 now resolved. afebrile overnight.
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
   - likely related to viral PNA
   .
   # Afib with RVR. In NSR now. PO dilt decreased to 60 mg QID due to
   relative hypotension. Continues on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. TSH
   elevated, however considered to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal
   ejection fraction and no evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 60 mg qid
   - cont metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Relative hypotension. Limiting Dilt and Metoprolol doses.
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib.
   - hoding diuresis at the moement - no change in mentation, or change in
   UO, perfusing appropriately
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   .
   # h/o GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to
   rectosigmoid junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels
   were patent in prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and
   inflammatory also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions
   required with continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward
   steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, pulmonary edema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and previous gastric ulcer bleeding. The patient was admitted with bronchospasm, bronchial constriction, and pleuritic pain, which improved with nebulizers and increased FiO2. 

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
- Heart rate: 74 bpm (59-92)
- Blood pressure: 101/55 mmHg (76/39-126/71)
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (15-30)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on high flow nebulizer

The patient has been diagnosed with RSV pneumonia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema. The working diagnosis includes fluid overload in addition to underlying lung disease in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. The patient was diuresed with Lasix and treated with Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters in sputum. Despite antibiotic therapy, the patient continued to spike fevers and tested positive for RSV. Antibiotics have been held, and supportive treatment is being provided.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema. He was admitted with bronchospasm, bronchial constriction, and pleuritic pain. The patient tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia and was placed on droplet precautions.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxia: The patient experienced an acute hypoxic episode with right-sided pleuritic pain. ABG showed pH 7.51, PaCO2 41, PaO2 80, and SaO2 34 on high flow O2. The patient responded well to nebulizers and increased FiO2. Differentials include mucus plugging and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's underlying lung disease (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) and CHF are contributing to the pulmonary edema. Fluid overload is also a concern due to loss of atrial forward flow. The patient was diuresed with Lasix and treated with Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for possible group of pneumonia. Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient continued to spike fevers. RSV PNA is the likely cause of hypoxia in the setting of IPF. Supportive treatment will be continued, and diuresis will be reassessed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, there are several significant events that occurred within the 24-hour period. 

Firstly, the patient's hyponatremia improved with fluid restriction but did not diurese. Secondly, the patient's atrial fibrillation (AF) was controlled throughout the day by titrating down diltiazem to 60mg QID. Additionally, the patient experienced low pressures, which could indicate issues with heart function or fluid balance.

The patient also had an acute hypoxic episode in the PM with right-sided pleuritic pain. The chest X-ray was unchanged, and the symptoms improved with nebulizers (nebs) and increased FiO2. An arterial blood gas (ABG) at that time showed a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 41, SaO2 of 80%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 100 on high flow O2 (~85%).

In terms of allergies, the patient is allergic to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), with an unknown specific reaction. The last dose of antibiotics given was vancomycin on 01/14/2129 at 08:30 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature range of 36.1 - 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 74 and 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/55 to 81/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow neb.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid input of 1,820 mL and output of 2,290 mL since 12 AM. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating throughout the day.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on high flow nebulizers and having an SpO2 of 98%. The ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.51 and elevated PaCO2 of 41. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 100, which suggests moderate hypoxemia.

Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient not being fully assessed in several areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and various pulses.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Blood chemistry values indicate hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and normal renal function. Other lab results show elevated lactate levels and abnormal coagulation profile.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including heart failure (systolic), interstitial lung disease, ischemic colitis, ascites, pneumonia, electrolyte & fluid disorder, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired ventilation, atrial fibrillation, fever, gastrointestinal bleed, anxiety, and pain control."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ? Hep C
   infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfered back to MICU for Afib
   with RVR.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 had acute hypoxic episode yesterday afternoon with R-sided
   pleuritic pain -> CXR unchanged, improved with nebs and increased
   FiO2.  ABG at that time: 7.51/41/80/34 on high flow O2 (~85%)
   Patient has RSV PNA, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary
   edema.  Despite Echo, patient has CHF and this can be contributing to
   the pulmonary edema. Working diagnosis includes fluid overload in
   addition to underlying lung disease in setting of afib with RVR and
   loss of atrial 10% forward flow. Patient was diuresed with Lasix and
   treated with Vanc/Ceftriaxone for GPCs in pair and clusters in sputum.
   Despite abx, pt continued to spike fevers
 tested positive for RSV, abx
   d/c
d [**1-14**]. Patient placed on droplet precautions. AFB negative x3, no
   concern for TB.
   - Hypoxia likely due to RSV PNA in the setting of IPF. Continue to hold
   abx and give supportive tx.
   - diuresis not improving patient much, appearing dry (clinically and
   based on urine lytes)
 will titrate down lasix (40mg qday, c/s holding
   today)
   .
   # H/o fevers
 now resolved. afebrile overnight.
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
   - likely related to viral PNA
   .
   # Afib with RVR. In NSR now. PO dilt decreased to 60 mg QID due to
   relative hypotension. Continues on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. TSH
   elevated, however considered to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal
   ejection fraction and no evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 60 mg qid
   - cont metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run
   .
   # Relative hypotension. Limiting Dilt and Metoprolol doses.
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib.
   - hoding diuresis at the moement - no change in mentation, or change in
   UO, perfusing appropriately
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   .
   # h/o GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to
   rectosigmoid junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels
   were patent in prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and
   inflammatory also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions
   required with continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward
   steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - active type and cross
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - on reg diet
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 likely from SIADH; improving with fluid restriction
   - fluid restriction for now
   - continue to monitor
     .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - liver on CT scan is unremarkable
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.  Patient completed ROMI.
   - on ASA.

The patient was admitted with bronchopneumonia (BRBPR) and tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia. 

The patient's recent events include an acute hypoxic episode with right-sided pleuritic pain, which improved with nebulizers and increased FiO2. The arterial blood gas (ABG) at that time showed pH 7.51, PaCO2 41, PaO2 80, and HCO3- 34, with an oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow oxygen.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.1°C (97F), heart rate 74 bpm (59-92 bpm), blood pressure 101/55 mmHg (76-126/71-80 mmHg), respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute (15-30 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 98%. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus rhythm (SR).

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet (Plt) levels. However, the creatinine (Cr) level is elevated at 0"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ? Hep C
   infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfered back to MICU for Afib
   with RVR.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Patient has RSV PNA, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and
   pulmonary edema.  Despite Echo, patient has CHF and this can be
   contributing to the pulmonary edema. Working diagnosis includes fluid
   overload in addition to underlying lung disease in setting of afib with
   RVR and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. Patient was diuresed with
   Lasix and treated with Vanc/Ceftriaxone for GPCs in pair and clusters
   in sputum. Despite abx, pt continued to spike fevers
 tested positive
   for RSV, abx d/c
d [**1-14**]. Patient placed on droplet precautions. AFB
   negative x3, no concern for TB.
   Pt had acute hypoxic episode yesterday afternoon with R-sided pleuritic
   pain -> CXR unchanged, improved with nebs and increased FiO2.  ABG at
   that time: 7.51/41/80/34 on high flow O2 (~85%)
   - Differentials include mucus plugging and PE
   - Check LENIs for DVT, if negative check CTA to rule out PE; even small
   PE may severely affect resp status given his baseline IPF. If +PE, need
   to discuss anticoagulation vs IV filter with GI, as pt is high risk for
   rebleed.
   - Hypoxia likely due to RSV PNA in the setting of IPF. Continue to hold
   abx and give supportive tx.
   .
   # H/o fevers
 now resolved. Afebrile overnight.
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
   - likely related to viral PNA
   .
   # Afib with RVR. In NSR now. PO dilt decreased to 60 mg QID due to
   relative hypotension. Continues on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. TSH
   elevated, however considered to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal
   ejection fraction and no evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 60 mg qid
   - cont metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run; will need to discuss with
   GI given h/o GIB
   .
   # Relative hypotension. Limiting Dilt and Metoprolol therapy for A
   fib
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib.
   - no diuresis at this time as clinically appears somewhat dry;
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   .
   # h/o GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to
   rectosigmoid junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels
   were patent in prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and
   inflammatory also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions
   required with continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward
   steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - on reg diet
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 likely from SIADH; improving with fluid restriction
   - fluid restriction for now
   - continue to monitor
     .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - liver on CT scan is unremarkable
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.  Patient completed ROMI.
   - on ASA.

   CXR [**2129-1-18**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-17**], diffuse
   interstitial lung disease persists. It is difficult to detect any area
   of acute focal pneumonia radiographically, since this could easily be
   hidden within the widespread interstitial disease. Central catheter
   remains in place.
   CTA Chest [**2129-1-17**]: No PE seen. Compared to CT of [**2129-1-12**], areas of
   reticular and ground glass densities have become more extensive
   particularly in the LUL, but also in posterior areas of the LLL; this
   could represent increased extent of pulmonary edema superimposed on
   emphysema, however, a fibrotic process is also a
   consideration, esp with areas of bronchiectasis in RML and RLL.
   Bilateral pleural effusions have improved. There is also area of
   increased consolidation in the posterior RUL (3:12), which could
   represent also superimposed infection. Mediastinal and R>L hilar
   adenopathy. Fluid and oblong density in esophagus. Ascites, post
   surgical changes at GE junction, and upper abdominal lymph nodes, as
   seen on recent CT abd/pelv.
   Bilat LENIs [**2129-1-17**]: IMPRESSION: Thrombosis is seen in several
   superficial veins, however, no evidence of deep venous thrombosis seen.
   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ? Hep C
   infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfered back to MICU for Afib
   with RVR.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Patient has RSV PNA, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and
   pulmonary edema.  Despite Echo, patient has CHF and this can be
   contributing to the pulmonary edema. Working diagnosis includes fluid
   overload in addition to underlying lung disease in setting of afib with
   RVR and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. Patient was diuresed with
   Lasix and treated with Vanc/Ceftriaxone for GPCs in pair and clusters
   in sputum. Despite abx, pt continued to spike fevers
 tested positive
   for RSV, abx d/c
d [**1-14**]. Patient placed on droplet precautions. AFB
   negative x3, no concern for TB.
   Oxygen requirements have remained stable since yesterday.  LENIs show
   no DVT and CTA no PE.  However, CTA does show worsening of fibrotic
   disease, concerning for accelerated IPF and likely also related to RSV
   infection.  Continue to hold abx and give supportive tx.
   - start solumedrol 125 mg Q8H for IPF
   - f/u final results of imaging
   .
   # H/o fevers
 now resolved. Afebrile overnight.
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
 neg. to date
   - likely related to RSV PNA

   # Afib with RVR. In NSR now. PO dilt decreased to 60 mg QID due to
   relative hypotension. Continues on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. TSH
   elevated, however considered to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal
   ejection fraction and no evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 60 mg qid
   - cont metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run; will need to discuss with
   GI given h/o GIB
   .
   # Relative hypotension. Limiting Dilt and Metoprolol therapy for A
   fib
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib.
   - no diuresis at this time as clinically appears somewhat dry;
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   - some of leg pain may be related to superficial clots, will provide
   warm compresses to area
   .
   # h/o GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to
   rectosigmoid junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels
   were patent in prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's chief complaint is gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and the reason for MICU transfer is atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). 

The patient has a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary edema, gastric ulcer bleeding (GIB), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and possible Hepatitis C infection. 

The patient presented with hypoxia due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia, IPF, and pulmonary edema. Despite being on antibiotics, the patient continued to spike fevers and tested positive for RSV. Antibiotic therapy was discontinued, and the patient was placed on droplet precautions. AFB tests were negative three times, ruling out tuberculosis.

Imaging studies showed worsening fibrotic disease, concerning for accelerated IPF and likely related to RSV infection. The patient's oxygen requirements have remained stable since yesterday, and there is no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) on CTA. 

The patient's past medical history includes fevers now resolved, chronic pain disorder, GIB, and potential ischemic colitis. The cause of the GIB appears to be a gastric ulcer, and the colitis may be ischemic versus infectious.

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix),"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, ? Hep C
   infection admitted with BRBPR, now transfered back to MICU for Afib
   with RVR.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Patient has RSV PNA, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and
   pulmonary edema.  Despite Echo, patient has CHF and this can be
   contributing to the pulmonary edema. Working diagnosis includes fluid
   overload in addition to underlying lung disease in setting of afib with
   RVR and loss of atrial 10% forward flow. Patient was diuresed with
   Lasix and treated with Vanc/Ceftriaxone for GPCs in pair and clusters
   in sputum. Despite abx, pt continued to spike fevers
 tested positive
   for RSV, abx d/c
d [**1-14**]. Patient placed on droplet precautions. AFB
   negative x3, no concern for TB.
   Oxygen requirements have remained stable since yesterday.  LENIs show
   no DVT and CTA no PE.  However, CTA does show worsening of fibrotic
   disease, concerning for accelerated IPF and likely also related to RSV
   infection.  Continue to hold abx and give supportive tx.
   - start solumedrol 125 mg Q8H for IPF
   - f/u final results of imaging
   .
   # H/o fevers
 now resolved. Afebrile overnight.
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
 neg. to date
   - likely related to RSV PNA
   .
   # Afib with RVR. In NSR now. PO dilt decreased to 60 mg QID due to
   relative hypotension. Continues on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. TSH
   elevated, however considered to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal
   ejection fraction and no evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 60 mg qid
   - cont metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run; will need to discuss with
   GI given h/o GIB
   .
   # Relative hypotension. Limiting Dilt and Metoprolol therapy for A
   fib
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib.
   - no diuresis at this time as clinically appears somewhat dry;
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   - some of leg pain may be related to superficial clots, will provide
   warm compresses to area
   .
   # h/o GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to
   rectosigmoid junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels
   were patent in prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and
   inflammatory also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions
   required with continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward
   steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics

   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, HCV admitted
   with BRBPR, now transfered back to MICU for Afib with RVR with
   complication of RSV pneumonia and worsening IPF.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Most likely due to accelerated IPF with some contribution
   from RSV pneumonia.  Oxygen requirements have remained stable for the
   last two days, though waxes and wanes throughout the day.  Previously
   during this admission patient was diuresed with lasix and treated with
   Vanc/Ceftriaxone for GPCs in pair and clusters in sputum. AFB negative
   x3, no concern for TB.  LENIs show no DVT and CTA no PE.  However, CTA
   does show worsening of fibrotic disease. Continue to hold abx and give
   supportive tx.
   - cont. solumedrol 125 mg Q8H for IPF (D1 = [**1-18**])
   - f/u final results of imaging
   .
   # H/o fevers
 Had resolved but patient spiked to 100.5 overnight.
   Recultured
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
 neg. to date
   - likely related to RSV PNA
   .
   # Afib with RVR. In NSR now. PO dilt decreased to 60 mg QID due to
   relative hypotension and dose held this morning for hypotension.
   Continues on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. TSH elevated, however considered
   to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal ejection fraction and no
   evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 60 mg qid
   - cont metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run; will need to discuss with
   GI given h/o GIB
   .
   # Relative hypotension. Limiting Dilt and Metoprolol therapy for A
   fib
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib.
   - no diuresis at this time as clinically appears somewhat dry;
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - will start fentanyl patch 25 mcg/hr
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   - some of leg pain may be related to superficial clots, will provide
   warm compresses to area
   .
   # h/o GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to
   rectosigmoid junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels
   were patent in prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and
   inflammatory also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions
   required with continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward
   steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - on reg diet
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 likely from SIADH; improving with fluid restriction
   - fluid restriction for now
   - continue to monitor
     .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - liver on CT scan is unremarkable
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.  Patient completed ROMI.
   - on ASA.
   .
   # FEN: fluid restricted and reg diet; checking finger sticks and giving
   ss insulin given high dose steroids
   .
   # PPx: Hep SQ, protonix IV BID
   .
   # Access: PICC [**1-12**]
   .
   # Code: full; discussing with patient his wishes given worsening IPF
   and increased O2 requirements that will likely not improve.
   .
   # Dispo: ICU for now pending further discussions of patient
s wishes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary edema, gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. He is admitted with bronchopulmonary sequestration (BRBPR) and now transferred back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for AFib with RVR and complications of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia and worsening IPF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: Due to accelerated IPF with some contribution from RSV pneumonia. Oxygen requirements remain stable but may wax and wane throughout the day. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery and being closely monitored.
2. Fever: The patient had resolved fevers but spiked to 100.5 degrees overnight. Blood, sputum, stool, and urine cultures are negative to date, likely related to RSV PNA.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm (SR), but he has a history of AFib with RVR. He is on metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID and diltiazem 60 mg PO QID. D"

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema. He was admitted for bronchopulmonary infection and underwent surgery for a gastric ulcer bleed. The patient's current symptoms include hypoxia, fever, and relative hypotension. He has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hepatitis C virus infection. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 97/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation may be due to accelerated IPF with some contribution from RSV pneumonia. Oxygen requirements have remained stable for the last two days, but the patient's condition may worsen if oxygenation does not improve.
2. Fever: The patient had a spike in temperature overnight, which could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. Further evaluation and cultures are needed to determine the cause.
3. Relative Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, possibly due to his medications for atrial fibrillation. Adjustments to his antihypertensive therapy may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 9-year-old male who presented to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of constipation, heart failure, interstitial lung disease, ischemic colitis, ascites, pneumonia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired ventilation, atrial fibrillation, fever, gastrointestinal bleed, anxiety, pain control, and acute/chronic pain.

24-hour events include the initiation of a fentanyl patch. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits except for a slightly low blood pressure and decreased urine output. The patient is receiving various medications in the ICU, including infusions and other medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted conditions. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, although there are bilateral dry crackles in the chest. The patient's lab results indicate several abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver enzymes, among others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, exacerbation of interstitial lung disease, further gastrointestinal bleeding, development of deep vein thrombosis, and potential infections due to the use of central lines. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, HCV admitted
   with BRBPR, now transfered back to MICU for Afib with RVR with
   complication of RSV pneumonia and worsening IPF.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Most likely due to accelerated IPF with some contribution
   from RSV pneumonia.  Oxygen requirements have remained stable recently,
   though waxes and wanes throughout the day.  Previously during this
   admission patient was diuresed with lasix and treated with
   Vanc/Ceftriaxone for GPCs in pair and clusters in sputum. AFB negative
   x3, no concern for TB.  LENIs show no DVT and CTA no PE.  However, CTA
   does show worsening of fibrotic disease. Continue to hold abx and give
   supportive tx.
   - cont. solumedrol 125 mg Q8H for IPF (D1 = [**1-18**]), transition to slow
   steroid taper with prednisone starting with 60mg, will need prednisone
   >50mg for the next 5 days [**12-20**] P jiroveci
   - B glucan positive, so will treat for P jiroveci with Mepron as sulfa
   allergy (no Bactrim)
   - will investigate for PFO, as could be contributing in setting of R>L
   shunt
   -Cont Combivent nebs
   - Check ABG and EKG
   .
   # H/o fevers

   jiroveci
   .
   # Afib with RVR. In NSR now. PO dilt decreased to 60 mg QID due to
   relative hypotension and dose held this morning for hypotension.
   Continues on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. TSH elevated, however considered
   to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal ejection fraction and no
   evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 60 mg qid and metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **], as BP permits
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run; will need to discuss with
   GI given h/o GIB
   .
   # Relative hypotension. Limiting Dilt and Metoprolol therapy for A
   fib
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib.
   - no diuresis at this time as clinically appears somewhat dry
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - Continue fentanyl patch 25 mcg/hr
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   - some of leg pain may be related to superficial clots, will provide
   warm compresses to area
   .
   # h/o GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to
   rectosigmoid junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels
   were patent in prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and
   inflammatory also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions
   required with continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward
   steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - on reg diet

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, gastric ulcer bleed, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hepatitis C. The patient was admitted with bronchospasm, bronchopneumonia, and acute kidney injury. He is currently in the ICU for worsening atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and complications from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia and IPF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has ongoing hypoxia due to accelerated IPF with some contribution from RSV pneumonia. Oxygen requirements fluctuate throughout the day.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has RSV pneumonia, which may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential complications such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has pulmonary edema, which can worsen with fluid overload or inadequate diuresis.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. It is important to monitor and manage his heart rhythm to prevent further complications.
5. GI Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastric ulcer bleed and chronic pain disorder. There is a risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Hepatitis C: The patient has hepatitis C infection, which can lead to complications such as liver"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary edema, gastric ulcer bleed, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and hepatitis C infection. The patient was admitted with bronchopulmonary infection and later developed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia. He has been treated with Lasix for pulmonary edema and Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters in sputum.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, which is most likely due to accelerated IPF with some contribution from RSV pneumonia. Oxygen requirements have remained stable recently, though they wax and wane throughout the day. The patient continues to receive supportive treatment and is being given steroids for IPF. He also has a positive B glucan, so he will be treated for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) due to his sulfa allergy.

The patient has a history of fevers, which have resolved but recently spiked to 100.5 degrees overnight. Cultures for blood, sputum, stool, and urine are negative to date. This could be related to RSV pneumonia or possibly PJP.

The patient's AFib with RVR is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) due to medication."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, HCV admitted
   with BRBPR, now transfered back to MICU for Afib with RVR with
   complication of RSV pneumonia and worsening IPF.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Most likely due to accelerated IPF with some contribution
   from RSV pneumonia.  Oxygen requirements have remained stable for the
   last two days, though waxes and wanes throughout the day.  Previously
   during this admission patient was diuresed with lasix and treated with
   Vanc/Ceftriaxone for GPCs in pair and clusters in sputum. AFB negative
   x3, no concern for TB.  LENIs show no DVT and CTA no PE.  However, CTA
   does show worsening of fibrotic disease. Continue to hold abx and give
   supportive tx.
   - cont. solumedrol 125 mg Q8H for IPF (D1 = [**1-18**])
   - f/u final results of imaging
   .
   # H/o fevers
 Had resolved but patient spiked to 100.5 overnight.
   Recultured
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
 neg. to date
   - likely related to RSV PNA
   .
   # Afib with RVR. In NSR now. PO dilt decreased to 60 mg QID due to
   relative hypotension and dose held this morning for hypotension.
   Continues on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. TSH elevated, however considered
   to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal ejection fraction and no
   evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 60 mg qid
   - cont metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run; will need to discuss with
   GI given h/o GIB
   .
   # Relative hypotension. Limiting Dilt and Metoprolol therapy for A
   fib
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib.
   - no diuresis at this time as clinically appears somewhat dry;
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - will start fentanyl patch 25 mcg/hr
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   - some of leg pain may be related to superficial clots, will provide
   warm compresses to area
   .
   # h/o GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to
   rectosigmoid junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels
   were patent in prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and
   inflammatory also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions
   required with continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward
   steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - on reg diet
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 likely from SIADH; improving with fluid restriction
   - fluid restriction for now
   - continue to monitor
     .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.
   - HCV VL 3 million
   - liver on CT scan is unremarkable
   - likely cause of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to
   be reversed
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.  Patient completed ROMI.
   - on ASA.
   .
   # FEN: fluid restricted and reg diet; checking finger sticks and giving
   ss insulin given high dose steroids
   .
   # PPx: Hep SQ, protonix IV BID
   .
   # Access: PICC [**1-12**]
   .
   # Code: full; discussing with patient his wishes given worsening IPF
   and increased O2 requirements that will likely not improve.
   .
   # Dispo: ICU for now pending further discussions of patient
s wishes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and pulmonary edema. He was admitted with bronchopneumonia due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and worsening IPF. The patient has a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen requirements have remained stable but wax and wane throughout the day. This could be due to accelerated IPF with some contribution from RSV pneumonia.
2. Fever: The patient had a resolved fever but spiked to 100.5 degrees overnight, which could be related to RSV pneumonia.
3. AFib with RVR: The patient's heart rate is controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol, but relative hypotension has limited the dose of these medications. There is a concern for nodal blockade in the setting of AFib.
4. Chronic pain disorder: The patient has been experiencing chronic pain, likely contributing to sciatica down the left leg. This may be related to superficial clots, and warm compresses have been provided to the area.
5. History of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo male with CHF, A-Fib c/p RVR and admitted with RSV and pulmonary
   edema contributing to respiratory distress in the setting of A-fib with
   RVR.  He did have some response to diuresis transiently but has
   returned to significant respiratory distress/hypoxemia this morning.
   This is with preserved lung sounds throughout with patient having
   pulmonary crackles unchanged
this would argue against significant new
   collapse or effusion.  It may well be small area of collapse leading to
   shunt transiently worsening.  Alternatively patient may have PE or R
   shunt worsening transiently this morning.

Will need
   -ABG this morning
   -ECG this morning

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation (A-fib) who was admitted with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and pulmonary edema contributing to respiratory distress. He had some response to diuretics but has now returned to significant respiratory distress and hypoxemia. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 102/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87%. 

Physical examination reveals dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds on the chest, indicating possible fluid accumulation in the lungs. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, slightly low platelet count, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's current condition suggests potential medical complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism (PE), or an intracardiac shunt contributing to persistent hypoxemia. 

The assessment and plan include addressing the patient's hypoxemia with further evaluation of ABG, ECG, and CXR in follow-up. The possibility of a right-to-left cardiac shunt causing refractory hypoxemia is being considered. The patient will continue on albuterol and S"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o gentleman with CHF Afib with RVR with hypoxia from RSV PNA,
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema off Abx on Lasix.
   Patient has h/o gastric ulcer bleed s/p surgery, CAD, HTN, HCV admitted
   with BRBPR, now transfered back to MICU for Afib with RVR with
   complication of RSV pneumonia and worsening IPF.
   .
   # Hypoxia
 Most likely due to accelerated IPF with some contribution
   from RSV pneumonia.  Oxygen requirements have remained stable recently,
   though waxes and wanes throughout the day.  Previously during this
   admission patient was diuresed with lasix and treated with
   Vanc/Ceftriaxone for GPCs in pair and clusters in sputum. AFB negative
   x3, no concern for TB.  LENIs show no DVT and CTA no PE.  However, CTA
   does show worsening of fibrotic disease. Continue to hold abx and give
   supportive tx.
   - cont. solumedrol 125 mg Q8H for IPF (D1 = [**1-18**]), transition to slow
   steroid taper with prednisone starting with 60mg, will need prednisone
   >50mg for the next 5 days [**12-20**] P jiroveci
   - B glucan positive, so will treat for P jiroveci with Mepron as sulfa
   allergy (no Bactrim)
   - will investigate for PFO, as could be contributing in setting of R>L
   shunt
   -Cont Combivent nebs
   - Check ABG and EKG
   .
   # H/o fevers
 Had resolved but patient spiked to 100.5 overnight.
   Recultured
   - f/u blood, sputum, stool, urine
 neg. to date
   - likely related to RSV PNA, but could have contribution with P
   jiroveci
   .
   # Afib with RVR. In NSR now. PO dilt decreased to 60 mg QID due to
   relative hypotension and dose held this morning for hypotension.
   Continues on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID. TSH elevated, however considered
   to be sick euthyroid. Echo showed normal ejection fraction and no
   evidence of structural heart disease.
   - cont dilt 60 mg qid and metoprolol 12. 5 mg [**Hospital1 **], as BP permits
   - BPs stable
   - consider anticoagulation in the long run; will need to discuss with
   GI given h/o GIB
   .
   # Relative hypotension. Limiting Dilt and Metoprolol therapy for A
   fib
   - likely in setting of nodal blockade for afib.
   - no diuresis at this time as clinically appears somewhat dry
   .
   # chronic pain disorder
 started tramadol on [**1-14**]. Patient has been on
   IV dilaudid chronically.
   - control with tramadol and diluadid PRN
   - Continue fentanyl patch 25 mcg/hr
   - back pain likely contributing to sciatica down L leg
   - some of leg pain may be related to superficial clots, will provide
   warm compresses to area
   .
   # h/o GIB: stable, CT showed colitis at the hepatic flexure to
   rectosigmoid junction. DDx includes ischemic, however large vessels
   were patent in prelim read of CT. Infectious suggestive on CT scan and
   inflammatory also on the differential. GI following.  No transfusions
   required with continued stable hematocrit, although trending downward
   steadily.
   - stable, now checking only daily hcts
   - continue to trend Hct, tx for hct <25
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - monitor hemodynamically and maintain access.
   .
   #Colitis: see above. Possible ischemic vs infectious, although in
   setting afib more likely ischemic. Further workup did not support this
   and the abdominal pain appears to be from chronic pain disorder.
   - colonoscopy as inpatient v. outpatient to evaluate per GI
   - stopping antibiotics
   - c.diff and other stool cultures neg
   - on reg diet
   .
   # Hyponatremia
 likely from SIADH; improving with fluid restriction,
   but down from 133 -> 130, will follow
   - fluid restriction for now
   - Trend Na
     .
   # Hep C infection: Pt states he has a history of hep c.  likely cause
   of elevated INR, not actively bleeding, does not need to be reversed;
   liver on CT scan is unremarkable
   - HCV VL 3 million
   .
   # h/o CAD: CP c/w chronic angina symptoms. EKG without any acute
   changes except had demand ischemia when in afib with high rates, repeat
   EKGs were normal.  Patient completed ROMI.
   - on ASA.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old gentleman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and pulmonary edema. The patient also has a history of gastric ulcer bleeding, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and is currently admitted with brownish-red blood in the urine (BRBPR).

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, fever, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, chronic pain disorder, history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), colitis, hyponatremia, and hepatitis C infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information are:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is most likely due to accelerated IPF with some contribution from RSV pneumonia. Oxygen requirements have remained stable recently, though they wax and wane throughout the day.

2. Fever: The patient had resolved fevers but spiked to 100.5 overnight. Cultures from blood, sputum, stool, and urine are negative to date. The fever may be related to RSV pneumonia or Pneumocystis jiroveci infection.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) but has a history of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old gentleman with a history of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and pulmonary edema. He was previously admitted for gastric ulcer bleeding and coronary artery disease (CAD). On this admission, he presented with bilateral rales throughout the lungs, hypoxia, and confusion.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia and worsening IPF. He has declined further respiratory support and is currently on morphine for comfort. His oxygen saturation has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/57 mmHg to 143/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 73%. He is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with minimal improvement in oxygenation.

Laboratory findings show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. His liver function tests are slightly abnormal, with elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes. The patient has a history of hepatitis C infection.

The patient's chest X-ray shows no interval change in diffuse interstitial markings consistent with IPF. There is no evidence of pneumonia, but the left central catheter"
