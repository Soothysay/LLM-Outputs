   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and a recent STEMI with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The patient also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and presents with hypotension after dialysis in the setting of troponin elevation and ECG changes.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. HYPOTENSION: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is likely multifactorial due to fluid removal during dialysis, possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic medications, and possibly cardiogenic shock. The patient appears to have new right ventricular (RV) failure, although it is unclear whether it is related to the recent myocardial infarction (MI) and left ventricular (LV) systolic failure. The patient also has known chronic diastolic failure. It is unlikely to be septic shock, as there is no evidence of infection.

2. CORONARIES: The ECG shows mildly increased ST depressions, slightly elevated cardiac enzymes, with no chest pain (CP) or evidence of anginal equivalent. It is possible that the patient has had an MI within the past few weeks.

3. PUMP: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was previously normal, but it"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He experienced a previous STEMI and cardiac arrest. The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis (HD). He presents with hypotension after dialysis, elevated troponin levels, and slightly increased ST depressions on the ECG. The patient has a history of esophagitis, gout, and depression. He is currently being treated with various medications including heparin, ranitidine, fluconazole, ASA, Plavix, pravastatin, and citalopram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTENSION: The patient's persistent hypotension could be due to fluid removal during dialysis, possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic medications, or cardiogenic shock. The physician plans to hold blood pressure medications, provide fluid boluses to maintain systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg, and closely monitor the patient after dialysis.
2. CORONARIES: The ECG shows mildly increased ST depressions, slightly elevated cardiac enzymes, with no chest pain or evidence of anginal equivalent. This suggests a possible recent myocardial infarction (MI). The physician recommends trending troponin, CK, and CK/MB every 6 hours, continuing telemetry monitoring, administering ASA 325, Plavix"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He experienced a STEMI and subsequent ventricular fibrillation arrest, resulting in diastolic dysfunction with recurrent pulmonary effusions. The patient is also on hemodialysis (HD) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

The patient presents with hypotension after dialysis, elevated troponin levels, and ECG changes suggestive of a possible cardiac event. The hypotension is likely multifactorial, including fluid removal during dialysis, a possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic medications, and potential cardiogenic shock.

The patient appears to have new right ventricular (RV) failure, although it is unclear whether it is related to a recent myocardial infarction (MI) or left ventricular (LV) systolic failure. The patient has known chronic diastolic failure. There is no evidence of septic shock, although there was a temporary increase in temperature.

The plan includes holding blood pressure medications (beta blocker, imdur), giving fluid boluses to keep systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg, monitoring mental status (no urine output since HD), starting dopamine if the patient becomes unresponsive to intravenous fluids, sending blood cultures, and withholding antibiotics unless there is evidence of infection.

Other assessments and plans include potential coronary artery disease with increased ST depressions"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, who experienced a sudden cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). The patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing health issues. These include hypotension after dialysis, elevated troponin levels indicating a possible myocardial infarction (MI), diastolic dysfunction with recurrent pulmonary effusions, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD), and a history of esophagitis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be multifactorial, including fluid removal during dialysis, possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic medications, and cardiogenic shock. The patient appears to have new right ventricular (RV) failure, although it is unclear whether this is due to a recent MI and left ventricular (LV) systolic failure. Chronic diastolic failure is also a known issue.

2. Coronary Arteries: The patient's ECG shows mildly increased ST depressions, slightly elevated cardiac enzymes, with no chest pain or evidence of anginal equivalent. It is possible that the patient had an MI within the past few weeks.

3. Pump Function: The patient's previously normal ejection fraction (EF) may have decreased now in the setting"

   Patient appears to have new RV failure, although unclear whether from
   recent MI and LV systolic failure.  He has known chronic diastolic
   failure.  Unlikely to be septic shock, although ?hx of temp to 100.4 on

   following intubation likely exacerbated by sedation.  Deferred dopamine
   overnight
   -Hold blood pressure meds (beta blocker, imdur) will give fluid boluses
   to keep SBP above 80 mmHg
   -cannot monitor mental status in setting of sedation (no urine output
   since HD)

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous CABG surgery, who presented with hypotension after dialysis. He has been experiencing chest pain during hemodialysis and underwent an emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which was technically difficult. The patient became agitated in the cath lab and required endotracheal intubation. There was an attempted but failed stent placement in the mid-PDA graft stenosis, resulting in graft occlusion. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has acute respiratory alkalosis, with high rate and high plateau pressures. Right internal jugular (IJ) central catheter placement was successful, but right radial line placement was unsuccessful. The patient is hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s-80s and received one 500cc normal saline (NS) bolus. His allergies are unknown. He is receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam in the ICU. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the recent events. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 79/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg. His"

   during HD on [**2102-10-23**], now s/p failed PCI, intubated, with persistent
   hypotension.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Likely multifactorial in the setting of fluid removal at
   dialysis, possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic meds
   (received percocets yesterday).  Less likely cardiogenic shock.
   Patient appears to have new RV failure, although unclear whether from
   recent MI and LV systolic failure.  He has known chronic diastolic
   failure.  Unlikely to be septic shock, although ?hx of temp to 100.4 on
   [**2102-10-20**], no other evidence of infection.  Persistent hypotension
   following intubation likely exacerbated by sedation.  Deferred dopamine
   overnight
   -Hold blood pressure meds (beta blocker, imdur) will give fluid boluses
   to keep SBP above 80 mmHg
   -cannot monitor mental status in setting of sedation (no urine output
   since HD)
   -will start dopamine if patient becomes unresponsive to IVF
   -Send Blood Cx
   -Will not start antibiotics unless there is evidence of infection
   -pt would likely benefit from continuous a-line monitoring (ABGs, BP),
   difficult right radial placement, will likely need fem a-line
   -hypotension likely [**3-20**] RV failure (ishemia vs. left heart diastolic
   failure as etiology), less likely hypovolemic, septic, adrenal insuff,
   neurogenic, cardiogenic or tamponade physiology

   # CORONARIES: ECG will mildly increased ST depressions, slightly
   elevated cardiac enzymes, with no CP or evidence of anginal
   equivalent.  It is possible that he has had an MI within the past few
   weeks.   P/w chest pain yesterday morning, now s/p unsuccessful PCI
   -Trend troponin, CK and CK/MB Q6H x 2
   -continue telemetry
   -heparin ggt has been discontinued
   -ASA 325
   -Plavix 75, will switch omeprazole to zantac

   .
   # PUMP:  Previously normal EF, but could be decreased now in the
   setting of recent MI.  Also new RV failure of unclear etiology.
   -gentle fluid resuscitation with small boluses
   -will consider restarting heparin ggt also for hypokinesis
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation, with coumadin recently stopped (reason
   no clear from patient/chart).
   -will consider restarting heparin ggt
   -will hold off on nodal agents given continued hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG surgery, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presented with chest pain and was found to have ECG changes indicative of anterior ischemia. He underwent an emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which was technically difficult. The patient became agitated in the cath lab and required endotracheal intubation.

Post-procedure, the patient developed hypotension and was managed on mechanical ventilation. He had a central venous catheter placed in the right internal jugular vein due to difficulty placing a right radial line. The patient's arterial blood gases (ABGs) showed acute respiratory alkalosis, likely secondary to anxiety. High plateau pressures were also observed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 79/57 mmHg to 60/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His rhythm is atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of approximately 75 bpm.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including a history of STEMI, diastolic dysfunction with recurrent pulmonary effusions, and chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis. His troponin levels are elevated, suggesting possible myocardial injury. He continues to be hypotensive, and his blood pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. He experienced a sudden cardiac event with ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest in the past and has diastolic dysfunction with recurrent pulmonary effusions. The patient also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). He presented with hypotension after dialysis, troponin elevation, and ECG changes suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI).

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension is likely multifactorial, including fluid removal during dialysis, possible cardiac event, administration of analgesic medications, and sedation.
2. Right ventricular (RV) failure: The patient has new-onset RV failure, which could be due to ischemia or left heart diastolic failure. This is supported by the presence of increased right-sided heart pressures.
3. Acute respiratory alkalosis: The patient has acute respiratory alkalosis, likely secondary to anxiety. The high plateau pressures suggest possible lung issues such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism, but these are less likely.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has ongoing coronary artery disease with mildly increased ST depressions on ECG and slightly elevated cardiac enzymes. It is possible that he has had an MI within the past few weeks.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis (HD). The patient presented with hypotension after dialysis and was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and ECG changes suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). He underwent an emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but it was technically difficult and the patient became agitated, requiring endotracheal intubation.

Post-PCI, the patient developed hypotension and was managed with invasive ventilation. The patient's blood gases showed acute respiratory alkalosis, with high rate and high plateau pressures. A right internal jugular central catheter was placed, but a right radial line could not be placed. The patient was given a 500cc normal saline bolus due to hypotension.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. His last dose of antibiotics was on [**2102-10-20**]. He is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam, as well as other medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for chest pain during dialysis.

Flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's weight is 66.3 kg, and his height is 68 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 588 mL and output of 392 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube and is on mechanical ventilation (CMV/ASSIST mode) with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 22, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gases (ABGs) show a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, PaO2 of 388 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 24 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished, with no acute distress. The patient grimaces with movement/stimuli. Pupils are constricted. Cardiovascular examination shows normal pulse, regular rhythm, and no murmurs or rubs. The patient has diminished radial pulses on the right side and diminished distal pulses bilaterally. Respiratory examination shows symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion note, and coarse breath sounds from the ventilator. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Extremities show trace edema in both lower extremities. Skin examination is not assessed"

","Summary:
The patient presented with chest pain and underwent an emergent PCI due to ECG changes indicating anterior ischemia. The procedure was technically difficult, and the patient became agitated, requiring endotracheal intubation. The right IJ central catheter was placed, but the right radial line could not be placed. The patient experienced hypotension overnight and received a 500cc NS bolus. Currently, the patient is on ventilatory support with CMV/ASSIST mode, set at a rate of 22 breaths per minute, Vt of 350 mL, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI deferred due to hemodynamic instability. The ABG shows acute respiratory acidosis with high rate and high plateau pressures. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 79/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic hypotension, coronary artery disease, delirium/confusion, and chronic pleural effusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's high plateau pressures and acute respiratory acidosis suggest the possibility of ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can occur in critically ill patients.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia ("
