   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4045**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with PMH as listed above who was
   transferred to the MICU for dyspnea and recent dysphagia compalaints
   #) Respiratory distress -patient had very mild SOB by time she arrived
   to ICU service which was maintained on 2-4L oxygen via NC with oxygen
   saturations above 95% consistently and she continues to have minimal
   compalaints . CXR on admission showed hypertensive cardiomediastinal
   configuration but no evidence of aspirations or acute pulmonary
   process. She has benign lung exam and is CTA today.
   -plan to wean to RA today
   #) Mental status changes: Unclear etiology. Per nursing staff, she was
   alert, oriented, conversant on arrival, but had an episode after
   admission when she was not speaking in intelligible sentences. She had
   an initial differential for delerium which included severe dehydration,
   poor pain control, or other metabolic etiologies but after IVFs and
   better neck pain control she was much more alert and oriented and her
   communication was only hindered by her hoarse voice.
   - con
t current pain control regimen
   - IV fluids PRN for urine output less than 40cc/hr or MAP < 60.
   .
   #)Neurological findings:
   - neurology consulted and following, repeated MRI/MRA per neurology
   recommendations and the patient's neck MRA showed now evidence of
   dissections or pathology. Wet read of neck and head MRI on [**9-11**] was
   clear of any CVAs and showed no spinal cord impingement at C1 fx site,
   some cervical stenosis noted at lower levels. The patient's CT neck
   showed stable C1 fracture with no changes as compared to prior neck CT
   from [**9-5**]. She had an ENT exam with scope [**9-10**] that showed left partial
   vocal cord paralysis which may account for her hoarseness and suspected
   dysphagia, but true CN 12 partial involvement more fitting given
   leftward tongue deviation on exam and may be due to local edema, will
   continue to monitor for hopeful resolution.
   Repeat speech and swallow done after admission and patient was cleared
   [**9-10**] for thick liquids, purees and a nutrition team is also following.
   -callout to Neurology floor [**Hospital Ward Name **]
   - Will plan to f/up final results of MRI head and neck
   .
   #)C1 fracture: Occurred as a result of a recent mechanical fall. Her
   family decided to pursue a conservative approach. She was discharged
   with [**Location (un) 2420**] J collar in place which she will need to wear for the next
   3-4 months. As noted above no new radiological changes in fracture on
   CT since last CT done [**2145-9-5**].  Pain well controlled currently
   .
   #)Hypertension: Continued patient's home HCTZ on admission to ICU,
   added Lisinopril 10mg  qdaily for better control
   .
   #)GERD: Continue Omeprazole.
   .
   #) Pain control - continue oxycodone PRN,  first line acetaminophen
   .
   #)FEN: NPO initially, and will advance gradually to thick liquids and
   purees based on Speech and Swallow recs and will f/up additional
   nutrition consult input
   .
   #)Prophylaxis: Heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis; continue PPI
   .
   #)Access: 2 PIVs
   .
   #)Dispo: Pending clinical improvement , call out and  transfer  to
   neuro floor on [**Hospital Ward Name **] later today

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, GERD, and C1 fracture. She was admitted to the MICU for dyspnea and dysphagia complaints. Upon arrival, she had mild SOB and was placed on 2-4L oxygen via NC with oxygen saturations above 95%. She continues to have minimal complaints and is CTA today. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, initially presenting with an episode where she was not speaking in intelligible sentences. However, after IVFs and better pain control, she became more alert and oriented. Her communication is hindered by a hoarse voice due to left partial vocal cord paralysis, confirmed by ENT scope evaluation. MRI/MRA showed no evidence of dissections or pathology, and the CT neck showed a stable C1 fracture with no changes since the last neck CT. The patient has been cleared for thick liquids and purees by speech and swallow evaluation. She will need to wear a cervical collar for the next 3-4 months. Her potassium levels were repleted, and she continues to receive IV fluids PRN for urine output less than 40cc/hr or MAP < 60.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with dyspnea and was placed on supplemental oxygen. She remains stable with oxygen saturations above 95%. However, there is a risk of further respiratory distress if her condition wors"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-inch tall individual who presented with complaints of shortness of breath (SOB) and dysphagia. The patient tolerated crushed medications in apple sauce without any cough or dyspnea. Oxygen saturation remains above 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula. The patient has partial left vocal cord paralysis but is cleared for puree and thick liquids orally based on recent speech and swallow evaluation. The patient underwent an MRI of the head and neck.

Medical Complications:
1. Partial left vocal cord paralysis: This condition can lead to difficulty in speaking, breathing, and swallowing.
2. Potassium level of 2.7: Hypokalemia, which can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Abnormal laboratory values: The patient's white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total carbon dioxide, and magnesium levels are abnormal and require further evaluation.
4. Code status: Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)/Do Not Intubate (DNI), indicating that the patient does not want aggressive measures to prolong their life if they stop breathing or their heart stops.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 4045**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo female with PMH as listed above who was
   transferred to the MICU for dyspnea and recent dysphagia compalaints
   #) Respiratory distress -patient had very mild SOB by time she arrived
   to ICU service which was maintained on 4L oxygen via NC with oxygen
   saturations above 95% consistently and she continues to have minimal
   compalaints . CXR on admission showed hypertensive cardiomediastinal
   configuration but no evidence of aspirations or acute pulmonary
   process.
   #) Mental status changes: Unclear etiology. Per nursing staff, she was
   alert, oriented, conversant on arrival, but had an episode after
   admission when she was not speaking in intelligible sentences. She had
   an initial differential for delerium which included severe dehydration,
   poor pain control, or other metabolic etiologies but after IVFs and
   better neck pain control she was much more alert and oriented and her
   communication was only hindered by her hoarse voice.
   - Pain control
   - IV fluids.
   .
   #)Neurological findings:
   - neurology consulted and following, repeated MRI/MRA per neurology
   recommendations and the patient's neck MRA showed now evidence of
   dissections or pathology. Wet read of neck and head MRI on [**9-11**] was
   clear of any CVAs and showed no spinal cord impingement at C1 fx site,
   some cervical stenosis noted at lower levels. Will plan to f/up final
   results.   The patient's CT neck showed stable C1 fracture with no
   changes as compared to prior neck CT from [**9-5**]. She had an ENT exam with
   scope that showed left partial vocal cord paralysis which may account
   for her hoarseness and suspected dysphagia.
   Repeat speech and swallow done after admission and patient was cleared
   for thick liquids, purees and a nutrition team is also following.
   .
   #)C1 fracture: Occurred as a result of a recent mechanical fall. Her
   family decided to pursue a conservative approach. She was discharged
   with [**Location (un) 2420**] J collar in place which she will need to wear for the next
   3-4 months. As noted above no new radiological changes in fracture on
   CT since last CT done [**2145-9-5**].
   .
   #)Hypertension: Continued patient's home HCTZ on admission to ICU
   .
   #)GERD: Continue Omeprazole.
   .
   #) Pain control - continue oxycodone, acetaminophen
   .
   #)FEN: NPO initially, and will advance gradually to thick liquids and
   purees based on Speech and Swallow recs and will f/up additional
   nutrition consult input
   .
   #)Prophylaxis: Heparin SQ for DVT prophylaxis; continue PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, GERD, and recent mechanical fall resulting in a C1 fracture. She was admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and dysphagia complaints. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 124/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 2L nasal cannula. She is alert and oriented, but has a hoarse voice and left-sided CN VI palsy. The patient's labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but slightly elevated potassium level. Imaging studies reveal a stable C1 fracture with no changes since the last neck CT, clear of any CVAs, and cervical stenosis at lower levels. The patient has been started on conservative management for her C1 fracture and is cleared for thick liquids and purees based on the recent speech and swallow evaluation. She is also on pain control medications, IV fluids, and prophylactic heparin for DVT prevention. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is pending clinical improvement.

","The patient is a 95-year-old female with a history of C1 fracture following a mechanical fall and CN XII palsy. She was admitted with concern for respiratory failure, but her respiratory status is now stable. The patient is being weaned from the ventilator and is on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. She has vocal cord paralysis and is cleared for a dysphagia diet. The patient also has hypertension, for which she is taking lisinopril and HCTZ. She has mild hyperkalemia and hypokalemia, which are being monitored and treated accordingly. The patient's condition is stable, and she will be transferred to the floor with continued oxygen saturation monitoring due to impaired vocal cord function. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: Since the patient initially came in with concern for respiratory failure, there is a risk of it recurring, especially if the vocal cord paralysis worsens or if she develops any new respiratory infections.
2. Pneumonia: Due to her age and weakened respiratory status, the patient is at an increased risk of developing pneumonia, especially if she aspirates or has difficulty clearing secretions.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile in the ICU, there is a risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if they travel to the lungs.
4. Delirium or confusion: Older patients in the ICU"

   Total time spent:
","The patient is an elderly female with a history of C1 fracture and CN XII palsy following a mechanical fall. She was admitted with concerns of impending respiratory failure, indicated by a negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -24. The patient's current status is stable, and she is being weaned off respiratory assistance.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's initial concern for respiratory failure and CN XII palsy, there is a risk of further respiratory issues such as pneumonia or exacerbation of her existing condition.

2. Neurological complications: The patient's vocal cord paralysis and CN XII palsy indicate potential neurological complications. These can lead to difficulties in swallowing, speaking, and respiratory function.

3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure readings show hypertension, which may require management and monitoring. This could lead to complications such as heart failure or stroke if not properly controlled.

4. Infection-related complications: The presence of yeast in the urine culture suggests a possible fungal infection. This could progress to a systemic infection if not treated appropriately.

5. Kidney function complications: The patient's elevated bicarbonate levels may indicate mild contraction of the kidneys. Monitoring and management of fluid balance and electrolytes are crucial to prevent further kidney dysfunction.

6. Nutritional complications: Due to the patient's dysphagia, there is a risk of inadequate nutrition and associated complications such as malnutrition, weight loss, and"

   transferred to the MICU for dyspnea and recent dysphagia compalaints
   #) Respiratory distress -patient had very mild SOB by time she arrived
   to ICU service which was maintained on 2-4L oxygen via NC with oxygen
   saturations above 95% consistently and she continues to have minimal
   compalaints . CXR on admission showed hypertensive cardiomediastinal
   configuration but no evidence of aspirations or acute pulmonary
   process. She has benign lung exam and is CTA today.
   -plan to wean to RA today
   #) Mental status changes: Unclear etiology. Per nursing staff, she was
   alert, oriented, conversant on arrival, but had an episode after
   admission when she was not speaking in intelligible sentences. She had
   an initial differential for delerium which included severe dehydration,
   poor pain control, or other metabolic etiologies but after IVFs and
   better neck pain control she was much more alert and oriented and her
   communication was only hindered by her hoarse voice.

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4045**], a [**Age over 90 **]year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and GERD, was admitted to the MICU for dyspnea and dysphagia complaints. She is currently on antibiotics (ceftriaxone) for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and has been started on IV fluids. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 154/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. She is also receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient initially had mild shortness of breath but is now on 2-4 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula and oxygen saturations remain above 95%. A chest X-ray showed hypertensive cardiomediastinal configuration but no evidence of aspiration or acute pulmonary process. She continues to have a benign lung exam and is planned to be weaned off respiratory support today.
2. Mental status changes: The patient was alert and oriented upon arrival but experienced an episode of not speaking in intelligible sentences after admission. This could be due to severe dehydration, poor pain control, or other"

   dysphagia; now found to have E. Coli UTI.
   #) Respiratory distress -patient had very mild SOB by time she arrived
   to ICU service which was maintained on 2-4L oxygen via NC with oxygen
   saturations above 95% consistently and she continues to have minimal
   compalaints. CXR on admission showed hypertensive cardiomediastinal
   configuration but no evidence of aspirations or acute pulmonary
   process. Pt desats to 90-91% on RA when sleeping, however, maintains
   saturation in mid-90s during the daytime
   - Continue O2 supplementation at night
   #) Mental status changes: Unclear etiology. Per nursing staff, she was
   alert, oriented, conversant on arrival, but had an episode after
   admission when she was not speaking in intelligible sentences. She had
   an initial differential for delerium which included severe dehydration,
   poor pain control, or other metabolic etiologies but after IVFs and
   better neck pain control she was much more alert and oriented and her
   communication was only hindered by her hoarse voice. Resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 95-year-old female who presented with dyspnea and was found to have a C1 fracture and CN XII palsy after a mechanical fall. She had a urinary tract infection (UTI) that was treated with ceftriaxone, and her Foley catheter was inserted due to urinary frequency and foul-smelling urine. Her vital signs are stable, and she is tolerating a dysphagia diet. The patient's review of systems is unchanged except for dysuria. Her lab results show mild anemia and thrombocytopenia, but all other values are within normal range. The patient's assessment includes UTI, dysphagia, neurologic injury, respiratory status, hypovolemia, hypertension, and falls. The plan includes continuing ceftriaxone for UTI, reassessing dysphagia, consulting physical therapy, weaning oxygen, using a cervical collar for neurologic protection, providing small IV fluid boluses, stopping HCTZ for hypertension, and titrating lisinopril as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's age and immobility increase the risk of developing pneumonia, especially if respiratory support is weaned.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and advanced age are risk factors for DVT. The patient is receiving prophylactic UF heparin, which helps reduce"
