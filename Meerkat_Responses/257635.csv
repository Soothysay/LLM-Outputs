   Assessment and Plan
   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.  Overnight,
   patient has been tachycardic and hypotensive. Lasix drip stopped, given
   total fluid bolus of 750 ml.
   #.Failure to wean from ventilator: Patient has a history of COPD, per
   notes from outside hospital it appears that he was felt to have severe
   COPD and on home O2 and steroids. Patient has failed to wean from
   ventilator; bronchoscopy done at OSH suggested possible
   tracheobronchomalacia. Patient was seen and evaluated by IP on arrival;
   per their notes, they will plan on flexible bronchoscopy once medically
   stabilized. Also in OSH notes there is some report of ?Aspergillus in
   sputum, ?ABPA, but felt not to be cause of his PNA; however, this would
   also fit with eosinophilia. Patient does appear to have significant
   bronchiectasis on CXR which is also a likely explanation for why he may
   be failing to wean from ventilator.
   -IP following, will plan on flex bronchoscopy; patient is now medically
   clear per cardiology
   -ABG to assess current respiratory status on ventilator
   -IgE levels Aspergillus
   #Elevated troponins: Patient was seen and evaluated by Cardiology; per
   the history they obtained from him, they found no evidence of chest
   pain symptoms, and felt that because he is asymptomatic at this time,
   and it is unlikely that his presentation is a true acute coronary
   syndrome requiring emergent cardiac catheterization. Troponins have
   remained stable. Per history that we were able to obtain with a
   translator he has not had any chest pain. One concern is that he may
   have an element of demand ischemia, especially given that he appears to
   be atrial paced at a rate of 90 bpm.
   -Continue ASA
   -Check lipids with AM labs
   -EP consult as patient appears to be atrial paced at rate of 90bpm
   -Beta blocker to help with rate control down to where he has been
   Atrial paced (currently HR 100s-120s)
   -Cardiology has signed off, feel patient stable for any intervention
   that IP wishes.
   .
   #Right eye injection/macular rash around orbit: Patient does describe
   pain in right eye, pain with movement of right eye, difficulty with
   vision out of right eye. Patient was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH,
   initially on Acyclovir, but optho felt that not consistent with
   herpetic eye involvement, most likely chronic conjunctival chemosis.
   Currently no vesicular rash around eye so nothing to biopsy.
   -Ophtho consult in AM as unclear what plan for management of eye was at
   OSH, and patient appears to be experiencing new/worsening symptoms
   # Facial twitching: Appeared as though this may have been a possible
   seizure, though patient did not have clear post-ictal state. Concern
   also for possible air embolus given that episode happened in the
   context of RIJ pull. Will continue to monitor for further signs of
   seizure. Will also need head CT eventually
   -EEG
   -Monitor for signs of seizures
   #Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to Lasix
   80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission (presumably dry weight) was
   62 kg. [**Month (only) 51**] be preload dependent given degree of hypotension experienced
   with Lasix.
   -D/c lasix for now as patient appears to be tolerating this poorly,
   becoming tachycardic and hypotensive.
   -Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day
   #.Leukocytosis: patient was transfered on multiple antibiotics for
   several infections he experienced during 2 months at OSH. At this time,
   he has been taken off all antibiotics, and has been afebrile. However,
   does have mild leukcocytosis (11.8). Will continue to monitor. Sputum
   culture shows  >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field, as well as
   1+ gram neg rods. [**Month (only) 51**] represent colonization with pseudomonas given his
   trach. Will plan to treat if patient becomes febrile. Patient also has
   significant history of diarrhea, so will plan to send C.diff cultures.
   -Monitor fever curve
   -F/u pan culture
   -Stool for C.diff
   -Send galactomannan to assess for possible aspergillosis
   #Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia; however, it
   subsequently normalized. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to adrenal insufficiency
   (patient was on prednisone for unknown amount of time on arrival to
   OSH, unclear how much this was continued), may be secondary to
   parasitic infection given recent travel to [**Country **]; may be secondary
   to medication.
   -Stool for O&P x3
   -AM cortisol
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   .
   #.Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin.
   Patient also receiving frequent blood draws which may be contributing
   to drop in HCT as well. Relatively stable this morning (of note,
   patient had multiple attempts at central line placement yesterday).
   (HCT 32.4 yesterday
 29.2 today).
   -Guiaic stools
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   .
   #Elevated alk phos: Alk phos elevated at 236. [**Month (only) 51**] be a continued
   sequelae of shock liver. Will plan to continue to monitor in a few
   days. If continues to be elevated, may consider getting GGT to
   differentiate if this is secondary to increased bone turnover secondary
   to chronic bedbound state.
   -Continue to monitor
   .
   #Hypokalemia: Replete potassium as needed.
   #Hypernatremia: free water flushes via PEG (150 ml q6 hours)
   #Decreased albumin: Measuring prealbumin. Patient most likely
   chronically malnourished given long hospital course. Tube feeds via PEG
   tube, f/u prealbumin.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].
   -Wound care consult
   -Optimize nutrition
   -Frequent repositioning
   .
   FEN: Tube feeds via PEG tube
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with: Heparin SQ
   -Bowel regimen
   -Pain management with

   ACCESS: Left subclavian in place from OSH. Plan is to d/c left
   subclavian and send tip for culture, PICC placement (if can be done
   over the weekend) vs. LIJ
   CODE STATUS: No right heart cath, full code.
   .
   EMERGENCY CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **] is married, however wife not [**Name2 (NI) 2681**]
   speaking; patient's sister suggests patient's daughter [**Name (NI) 11128**] should be

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who has been admitted to the ICU for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has had several complications during his hospital stay, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, and multiple infections.

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has been unable to be weaned off the ventilator.
- The patient has been tachycardic and hypotensive, leading to the discontinuation of the Lasix drip and administration of a fluid bolus.
- There is a concern for possible air embolus during the right internal jugular (RIJ) line pull, which resulted in facial twitching and a brief episode of unresponsiveness.
- The patient has elevated troponins, but cardiac evaluation did not reveal any evidence of acute coronary syndrome.
- The patient has leukocytosis with a sputum culture showing colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
- The patient also has eosinophilia, which could be secondary to adrenal insufficiency, parasitic infection, or medication.
- The patient is anemic with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin levels.
- The patient has elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, which may be a sequel"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.  Overnight,
   patient has been tachycardic and hypotensive. Lasix drip stopped, given
   total fluid bolus of 750 ml.
   #.Failure to wean from ventilator: Patient has a history of COPD, per
   notes from outside hospital it appears that he was felt to have severe
   COPD and on home O2 and steroids. Patient has failed to wean from
   ventilator; bronchoscopy done at OSH suggested possible
   tracheobronchomalacia. Patient was seen and evaluated by IP on arrival;
   per their notes, they will plan on flexible bronchoscopy once medically
   stabilized. Also in OSH notes there is some report of ?Aspergillus in
   sputum, ?ABPA, but felt not to be cause of his PNA; however, this would
   also fit with eosinophilia. Patient does appear to have significant
   bronchiectasis on CXR which is also a likely explanation for why he may
   be failing to wean from ventilator.
   -IP following, will plan on flex bronchoscopy; patient is now medically
   clear per cardiology
   -ABG to assess current respiratory status on ventilator
   -IgE levels Aspergillus
   #Elevated troponins: Patient was seen and evaluated by Cardiology; per
   the history they obtained from him, they found no evidence of chest
   pain symptoms, and felt that because he is asymptomatic at this time,
   and it is unlikely that his presentation is a true acute coronary
   syndrome requiring emergent cardiac catheterization. Troponins have
   remained stable. Per history that we were able to obtain with a
   translator he has not had any chest pain. One concern is that he may
   have an element of demand ischemia, especially given that he appears to
   be atrial paced at a rate of 90 bpm.
   -Continue ASA
   -Check lipids with AM labs
   -EP consult as patient appears to be atrial paced at rate of 90bpm
   -Beta blocker to help with rate control down to where he has been
   Atrial paced (currently HR 100s-120s)
   -Cardiology has signed off, feel patient stable for any intervention
   that IP wishes.
   .
   #Right eye injection/macular rash around orbit: Patient does describe
   pain in right eye, pain with movement of right eye, difficulty with
   vision out of right eye. Patient was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH,
   initially on Acyclovir, but optho felt that not consistent with
   herpetic eye involvement, most likely chronic conjunctival chemosis.
   Currently no vesicular rash around eye so nothing to biopsy.
   -Ophtho consult in AM as unclear what plan for management of eye was at
   OSH, and patient appears to be experiencing new/worsening symptoms
   # Facial twitching: Appeared as though this may have been a possible
   seizure, though patient did not have clear post-ictal state. Concern
   also for possible air embolus given that episode happened in the
   context of RIJ pull. Will continue to monitor for further signs of
   seizure. Will also need head CT eventually
   -EEG
   -Monitor for signs of seizures
   #Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to Lasix
   80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission (presumably dry weight) was
   62 kg. [**Month (only) 51**] be preload dependent given degree of hypotension experienced
   with Lasix.
   -D/c lasix for now as patient appears to be tolerating this poorly,
   becoming tachycardic and hypotensive.
   -Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day
   #.Leukocytosis: patient was transfered on multiple antibiotics for
   several infections he experienced during 2 months at OSH. At this time,
   he has been taken off all antibiotics, and has been afebrile. However,
   does have mild leukcocytosis (11.8). Will continue to monitor. Sputum
   culture shows  >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field, as well as
   1+ gram neg rods. [**Month (only) 51**] represent colonization with pseudomonas given his
   trach. Will plan to treat if patient becomes febrile. Patient also has
   significant history of diarrhea, so will plan to send C.diff cultures.
   -Monitor fever curve
   -F/u pan culture
   -Stool for C.diff
   -Send galactomannan to assess for possible aspergillosis
   #Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia; however, it
   subsequently normalized. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to adrenal insufficiency
   (patient was on prednisone for unknown amount of time on arrival to
   OSH, unclear how much this was continued), may be secondary to
   parasitic infection given recent travel to [**Country **]; may be secondary
   to medication.
   -Stool for O&P x3
   -AM cortisol
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   .
   #.Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin.
   Patient also receiving frequent blood draws which may be contributing
   to drop in HCT as well. Relatively stable this morning (of note,
   patient had multiple attempts at central line placement yesterday).
   (HCT 32.4 yesterday
 29.2 today).
   -Guiaic stools
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   .
   #Elevated alk phos: Alk phos elevated at 236. [**Month (only) 51**] be a continued
   sequelae of shock liver. Will plan to continue to monitor in a few
   days. If continues to be elevated, may consider getting GGT to
   differentiate if this is secondary to increased bone turnover secondary
   to chronic bedbound state.
   -Continue to monitor
   .
   #Hypokalemia: Replete potassium as needed.
   #Hypernatremia: free water flushes via PEG (150 ml q6 hours)
   #Decreased albumin: Measuring prealbumin. Patient most likely
   chronically malnourished given long hospital course. Tube feeds via PEG
   tube, f/u prealbumin.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].
   -Wound care consult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history of COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is currently experiencing several issues such as tachycardia, hypotension, facial twitching, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, decreased albumin, and pressure ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Seizures: The patient experienced facial twitching, which may indicate a possible seizure episode. Monitoring for further signs of seizure activity and ordering an EEG would be appropriate.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple infections during his hospital stay, and there is a sputum culture showing colonization with Pseudomonas. Monitoring for fever and treating if the patient becomes febrile would be important.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient's troponins are elevated, but he appears to be stable without chest pain symptoms. However, there is a concern for possible demand ischemia due to atrial pacing. Further evaluation by cardiology and monitoring the heart rate and rhythm would be necessary.
4. Eye infection: The patient has symptoms of pain and vision problems in the right eye. An ophthalmology consult"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.  Overnight,
   patient has been tachycardic and hypotensive. Lasix drip stopped, given
   total fluid bolus of 750 ml.
   #.Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronciectasis.  Bronch at OSH with
   ?tracheobronchomalacia.  IP plans to preform flexible bronchoscopy once
   medically stabilized. From OSH ?Aspergillus in sputum, ?ABPA, but felt
   not to be cause of his PNA; however, this would also fit with
   eosinophilia. Patient does appear to have significant bronchiectasis on
   CXR which is also a likely explanation for why he may be failing to
   wean from ventilator.
   -IP following, will plan on flex bronchoscopy; patient is now medically
   clear per cardiology
   -ABG to assess current respiratory status on ventilator
   -IgE levels Aspergillus
   #Elevated troponins: Patient was seen and evaluated by Cardiology; per
   the history they obtained from him, they found no evidence of chest
   pain symptoms, and felt that because he is asymptomatic at this time,
   and it is unlikely that his presentation is a true acute coronary
   syndrome requiring emergent cardiac catheterization. Troponins have
   remained stable. Per history that we were able to obtain with a
   translator he has not had any chest pain. One concern is that he may
   have an element of demand ischemia, especially given that he appears to
   be atrial paced at a rate of 90 bpm.
   -Continue ASA
   -Check lipids with AM labs
   -EP consult as patient appears to be atrial paced at rate of 90bpm
   -Beta blocker to help with rate control down to where he has been
   Atrial paced (currently HR 100s-120s)
   -Cardiology has signed off, feel patient stable for any intervention
   that IP wishes.
   #Right eye injection/macular rash around orbit: Patient does describe
   pain in right eye, pain with movement of right eye, difficulty with
   vision out of right eye. Patient was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH,
   initially on Acyclovir, but optho felt that not consistent with
   herpetic eye involvement, most likely chronic conjunctival chemosis.
   Currently no vesicular rash around eye so nothing to biopsy.
   -Ophtho consult in AM as unclear what plan for management of eye was at
   OSH, and patient appears to be experiencing new/worsening symptoms
   # Facial twitching: Appeared as though this may have been a possible
   seizure, though patient did not have clear post-ictal state. Concern
   also for possible air embolus given that episode happened in the
   context of RIJ pull. Will continue to monitor for further signs of
   seizure. Will also need head CT eventually
   -EEG
   -Monitor for signs of seizures
   #Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to Lasix
   80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission (presumably dry weight) was
   62 kg. [**Month (only) 51**] be preload dependent given degree of hypotension experienced
   with Lasix.
   -D/c lasix for now as patient appears to be tolerating this poorly,
   becoming tachycardic and hypotensive.
   -Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day
   #.Leukocytosis: patient was transfered on multiple antibiotics for
   several infections he experienced during 2 months at OSH. At this time,
   he has been taken off all antibiotics, and has been afebrile. However,
   does have mild leukcocytosis (11.8). Will continue to monitor. Sputum
   culture shows  >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field, as well as
   1+ gram neg rods. [**Month (only) 51**] represent colonization with pseudomonas given his
   trach. Will plan to treat if patient becomes febrile. Patient also has
   significant history of diarrhea, so will plan to send C.diff cultures.
   -Monitor fever curve
   -F/u pan culture
   -Stool for C.diff
   -Send galactomannan to assess for possible aspergillosis
   #Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia; however, it
   subsequently normalized. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to adrenal insufficiency
   (patient was on prednisone for unknown amount of time on arrival to
   OSH, unclear how much this was continued), may be secondary to
   parasitic infection given recent travel to [**Country **]; may be secondary
   to medication.
   -Stool for O&P x3
   -AM cortisol
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   #.Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin.
   Patient also receiving frequent blood draws which may be contributing
   to drop in HCT as well. Relatively stable this morning (of note,
   patient had multiple attempts at central line placement yesterday).
   (HCT 32.4 yesterday
 29.2 today).
   -Guiaic stools
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #Elevated alk phos: Alk phos elevated at 236. [**Month (only) 51**] be a continued
   sequelae of shock liver. Will plan to continue to monitor in a few
   days. If continues to be elevated, may consider getting GGT to
   differentiate if this is secondary to increased bone turnover secondary
   to chronic bedbound state.
   -Continue to monitor
   #Hypokalemia: Replete potassium as needed.
   #Hypernatremia: free water flushes via PEG (150 ml q6 hours)
   #Decreased albumin: Measuring prealbumin. Patient most likely
   chronically malnourished given long hospital course. Tube feeds via PEG
   tube, f/u prealbumin.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].
   -Wound care consult
   -Optimize nutrition
   -Frequent repositioning
   FEN: Tube feeds via PEG tube
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with: Heparin SQ
   -Bowel regimen
   -Pain management with
   ACCESS: Left subclavian in place from OSH. Plan is to d/c left
   subclavian and send tip for culture, PICC placement (if can be done
   over the weekend) vs. LIJ

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU for multiple complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, tracheobronchomalacia, and bronchiectasis. The patient is currently tachycardic and hypotensive, with elevated troponins. He has a history of right eye injection/macular rash around orbit, facial twitching, anasarca, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, decreased albumin, and pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and tracheobronchomalacia may contribute to ongoing respiratory failure. Flexible bronchoscopy is planned to assess the airway.
2. Cardiac Issues: Elevated troponins indicate possible cardiac involvement. The patient may have an element of demand ischemia, and further cardiac evaluation is needed.
3. Eye Infection: The patient presents with right eye injection/macular rash around orbit, which may be related to herpes infection. Ophthalmology consultation is required for management.
4. Seizure Activity: Facial twitching raises concern for possible seizure activity. Monitoring for further signs of seizure and an EEG are recommended.
5. Anasarca: The patient's fluid overload and hyp"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #.Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronciectasis.  Bronch at OSH with
   ?tracheobronchomalacia.  IP plans to preform flexible bronchoscopy once
   medically stabilized. From OSH ?Aspergillus in sputum, ?ABPA.
   -IP following, will plan on flex bronchoscopy; patient is now medically
   clear per cardiology
   -f/u IgE levels Aspergillus
   #. Seizure: Presumed seizure since he was unresponsive and twitching.
   No further episodes overnight.
   - EEG pending
   #Elevated troponins: No CP, Trops stable.  Cards eval, and does not
   require emergent cardiac catheterization. Possible demand ischemia, in
   setting of tachycardia and hypotension.   Beta blocker started
   yesterday.
   -Continue ASA
   -F/u lipids
   -When HR decreased so that pacer spikes can be viewed consider EP
   consult
   #.Leukocytosis: Afebrile off all antibiotics with mild leukocytosis,
   sputum culture shows  1+ GNR.  Colonization vs infection . Patient also
   has significant history of diarrhea, concern for C. diff.
   -Monitor fever curve, treat if becomes febrile
   -F/u pan culture
   -Stool for C.diff
   -F/u  galactomannan to assess for aspergillosis
   #Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to Lasix
   80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission (presumably dry weight) was
   62 kg. [**Month (only) 51**] be preload dependent given degree of hypotension experienced
   with Lasix.
   -D/c lasix for now as patient appears to be tolerating this poorly,
   becoming tachycardic and hypotensive.
   -Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day
   #Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia; however, it
   subsequently normalized. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to adrenal insufficiency
   (patient was on prednisone for unknown amount of time on arrival to
   OSH, unclear how much this was continued), may be secondary to
   parasitic infection given recent travel to [**Country **]; may be secondary
   to medication.
   -Stool for O&P x3
   -AM cortisol
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   #.Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin.
   Patient also receiving frequent blood draws which may be contributing
   to drop in HCT as well. Relatively stable this morning (of note,
   patient had multiple attempts at central line placement yesterday).
   (HCT 32.4 yesterday
 29.2 today).
   -Guiaic stools
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #Right eye injection/macular rash around orbit: Patient does describe
   pain in right eye, pain with movement of right eye, difficulty with
   vision out of right eye. Patient was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH,
   initially on Acyclovir, but optho felt that not consistent with
   herpetic eye involvement, most likely chronic conjunctival chemosis.
   Currently no vesicular rash around eye so nothing to biopsy.
   -Ophtho consult in AM as unclear what plan for management of eye was at
   OSH, and patient appears to be experiencing new/worsening symptoms
   #Elevated alk phos: Alk phos elevated at 236. [**Month (only) 51**] be a continued
   sequelae of shock liver. Will plan to continue to monitor in a few
   days. If continues to be elevated, may consider getting GGT to
   differentiate if this is secondary to increased bone turnover secondary
   to chronic bedbound state.
   -Continue to monitor
   #Hypokalemia: Replete potassium as needed.
   #Hypernatremia: free water flushes via PEG (150 ml q6 hours)
   #Decreased albumin: Measuring prealbumin. Patient most likely
   chronically malnourished given long hospital course. Tube feeds via PEG
   tube, f/u prealbumin.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].
   -Wound care consult
   -Optimize nutrition
   -Frequent repositioning
   FEN: Tube feeds via PEG tube
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with: Heparin SQ
   -Bowel regimen
   -Pain management with
   ACCESS: Left subclavian in place from OSH. Plan is to d/c left
   subclavian and send tip for culture, PICC placement (if can be done
   over the weekend) vs. LIJ
   CODE STATUS: No right heart cath, full code.
   EMERGENCY CONTACT: [**Name (NI) **] is married, however wife not [**Name2 (NI) 2681**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU due to multiple complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, tracheobronchomalacia, and aspiration bronchiectasis. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, seizure, elevated troponins, leukocytosis, anasarca, eosinophilia, anemia, right eye injection/maculopapular rash around orbit, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, decreased albumin, and pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and tracheobronchomalacia, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Seizure: The patient experienced a presumed seizure, and further evaluation is pending with an EEG.
3. Elevated Troponins: The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. However, the cardiologist does not require emergent cardiac catheterization.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has mild leukocytosis, and there is a concern for colonization or infection. Stool cultures and monitoring for fever are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history of COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. The patient's main issues include respiratory failure, seizure activity, elevated troponin levels, leukocytosis, anasarca, eosinophilia, anemia, right eye injection/macular orbital rash, elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, decreased albumin levels, and ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and tracheobronchomalacia puts him at risk for ongoing respiratory failure. The plan is to perform a flexible bronchoscopy once medically stable, but the patient may require continued ventilatory support.
2. Seizure: The patient experienced an episode of altered responsiveness with right-sided twitching, which could indicate a seizure. Further evaluation, including an EEG, is needed to determine the cause.
3. Elevated Troponins: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia. However, the patient does not have chest pain or other signs of acute coronary syndrome, and a cardiac catheterization is not considered emergent at this time.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to infection or colonization with gram-negative rods identified in the sputum culture. Monitoring fever curves and treating if the patient"

   62 kg. Making adequte UOP but lasix held given boarderline BP.
   - Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day
   - Low dose lasix gtt
   #. Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia which normalized
   now 14%. Concern for adrenal insufficiency, random Cortisol 1.8. Recent
   travel to [**Country **],  may be secondary to parasitic infection.  Also
   concern for drug reaction

   chronic conjunctival chemosis. Currently no vesicular rash around eye
   so nothing to biopsy.
   -Ophtho consult in Monday if worsens, appears more likely chronic.
   #. Elevated alk phos: Alk phos elevated at 236. [**Month (only) 51**] be a continued
   sequelae of shock liver. Will plan to continue to monitor in a few
   days. If continues to be elevated, may consider getting GGT to
   differentiate if this is secondary to increased bone turnover secondary
   to chronic bedbound state.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and other complications. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement, and was sent from another hospital for interventional pulmonology assessment for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia. The patient's recent events include a brief episode of altered responsiveness with right-sided twitching, presumed seizure, and elevated troponins with possible demand ischemia. The patient also has leukocytosis with mild elevation, anasarca, eosinophilia, anemia of chronic disease, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Additionally, the patient has right eye injection/macular orbital rash, elevated sodium levels, decreased albumin, and stage III and IV pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and failure to wean from the ventilator pose a high risk for respiratory failure.
2. Seizure: The episode of altered responsiveness with right-sided twitching may indicate a seizure, and further evaluation with EEG is pending.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: Elevated troponins suggest possible cardiac ischemia, and the patient's tachycardia and hypotension could indicate demand ischemia.
4. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and colonization with two species of Gram-negative rods in the sputum culture. There is also"

   tomorrow so that chest rads people could be there to do it right
   --L subclavian line pulled  --> cath tip pending
   --Respiratory status before [**8-21**]--Per family, just before
   hospitalization, pt was able to climb stairs (lives on 2nd story, able
   to get up and down OK), able to walk .5 mile to sister's house, would
   get tired sometimes and have to take a break, but was able to do ADL's.
   Was using inhalers and home O2 (but home O2 only <1 mo duration).
   Overall, seems like pt wasn't fully limited by COPD before [**8-21**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD and multiple medical complications. The patient has been hospitalized for a long period and has had several interventions, including tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He was admitted to the ICU for further assessment and management of his conditions.

The patient's current status includes respiratory failure due to COPD and suspected tracheobronchomalacia. He is on mechanical ventilation, and flexible bronchoscopy is planned once he is medically stable. The patient also has a history of possible Aspergillus infection and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), which will be further investigated.

Additionally, the patient has had a presumed seizure, for which an EEG and CT head are pending. His troponin levels are elevated, but cardiac catheterization is not required at this time. He has been started on a beta-blocker, and an electrophysiologist (EP) consult will be considered when his heart rate allows for viewing pacer spikes.

The patient is also diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency, and he has been started on prednisone. His leukocytosis is trending down, and there is a colonization or infection with two species of Gram-negative rods. A central line tip culture is pending, and his urine culture is positive for yeast.

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronciectasis.  Bronch at OSH with
   ?tracheobronchomalacia.  IP plans to preform flexible bronchoscopy once
   medically stabilized, which from our stand point he is. From OSH
   ?Aspergillus in sputum, ?ABPA. Per family report, patient using home O2
   for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he was not
   that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   -IP following, will plan on flex bronchoscopy; patient is now medically
   clear
   -f/u IgE levels Aspergillus
   - formal airway CT today
   - wean from vent
   #. Seizure: Presumed seizure since he was unresponsive and twitching.
   No further episodes.
   - EEG pending
   - CT head
   #. Elevated troponins: No CP, Trops stable.  Cards eval, and does not
   require emergent cardiac catheterization. Possible demand ischemia, in
   setting of tachycardia and hypotension.   Beta blocker started
   yesterday.  Lipids normal. Continues tachycardic.  Given concern for
   demand ischemia, will send another troponin today (EKG changes have
   resolved) and see if these are stable or if they are trending down. If
   increasing, will increase beta blocker to decrease demand ischemia
   -Continue ASA
   -When HR decreased so that pacer spikes can be viewed consider EP
   consult
   -Check troponin
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   #. Leukocytosis: Trending down still. Patient had mild temperature
   overnight (100.3), sputum culture shows 2 species GNR.  Colonization vs
   infection. Patient also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff
   neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled. In setting of new fevers, will
   pan-culture again out of concern for possible new infection given that
   patient has been afebrile so far in hosp.
   -repeat pan culture
   -SC tip pending
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to
   Lasix 80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission to OSH (presumably dry
   weight) was 62 kg.  On Lasix gtt now, very negative already today so
   monitor closely to make sure that he does not become hypotensive.
   - Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day
   - Low dose lasix gtt
   #. Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia which normalized
   now 14%. Concern for adrenal insufficiency, [**Last Name (un) **] stim test +. Recent
   travel to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be secondary to parasitic infection; however,
   O&P neg TD.  Also concern for drug reaction
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Anemia: Hct stable, likely anemia of chronic disease given long
   hospital course; iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and
   increased ferritin.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Patient does describe pain
   in right eye, pain with movement, and difficulty with vision. Patient
   was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH, initially on Acyclovir, but optho
   felt that not consistent with herpetic eye involvement, most likely
   chronic conjunctival chemosis. Currently no vesicular rash around eye
   so nothing to biopsy.
   -Ophtho consult today.
   #. Elevated alk phos: Alk phos elevated at 236 on admission, trending

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to multiple complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He was sent from another hospital for interventional procedure assessment for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient has been receiving diuretics, including Lasix, but developed hypotension and the diuretics were discontinued. He has been experiencing fever, with sputum cultures showing two species of Gram-negative rods, raising concerns for colonization or infection. The central line from the previous hospital has been pulled, and the tip is pending. The patient also has a history of diarrhea, with C. difficile negative.

The patient presented with eosinophilia, which has normalized now at 14%. There is concern for adrenal insufficiency, as indicated by a positive corticotropin stimulation test. The patient has recent travel history to [Last Name (LF)] and [First Name3 (LF)], which could be secondary to parasitic infection; however, the O&P test was negative.

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronciectasis.  Bronch at OSH with
   ?tracheobronchomalacia.  IP plans to preform flexible bronchoscopy once
   medically stabilized, which from our stand point he is. From OSH
   ?Aspergillus in sputum, ?ABPA. Per family report, patient using home O2
   for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he was not
   that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   -IP following, will plan on flex bronchoscopy; patient is now medically
   clear
   -f/u IgE levels Aspergillus
   - formal airway CT today
   - wean from vent
   #. Seizure: Presumed seizure since he was unresponsive and twitching.
   No further episodes.
   - EEG pending
   - CT head
   #. Elevated troponins: No CP, Trops stable.  Cards eval, and does not
   require emergent cardiac catheterization. Possible demand ischemia, in
   setting of tachycardia and hypotension.   Beta blocker started
   yesterday.  Lipids normal. Now on home dose of metoprolol, continues to
   be tachycardic.
   -Continue ASA
   -When HR decreased so that pacer spikes can be viewed consider EP
   consult
   -Increase Metoprolol
   #. Leukocytosis: Trending down still. Patient had mild temperature
   overnight (100.3) , sputum culture shows 2 species GNR.  Colonization
   vs infection. Patient also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff
   neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled.
   -SC tip pending
   -Urine culture positive for yeast
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to
   Lasix 80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission to OSH (presumably dry
   weight) was 62 kg.
   - Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day
   - Low dose lasix gtt
   #. Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia which normalized
   now 14%. Concern for adrenal insufficiency, random Cortisol 1.8. Recent
   travel to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be secondary to parasitic infection; however,
    Also concern for drug reaction
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   #. Anemia: Hct stable, likely anemia of chronic disease given long
   hospital course; iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and
   increased ferritin.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Patient does describe pain
   in right eye, pain with movement, and difficulty with vision. Patient
   was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH, initially on Acyclovir, but optho
   felt that not consistent with herpetic eye involvement, most likely
   chronic conjunctival chemosis. Currently no vesicular rash around eye
   so nothing to biopsy.
   -Ophtho consult in Monday if worsens, appears more likely chronic.
   #. Elevated alk phos: Alk phos elevated at 236 on admission, trending
   down to 187 on [**11-13**]. Most likely secondary to shock liver, now
   resolving.
   -Continue to monitor
   #Hypokalemia: Resolved.
   #Hypernatremia: 148
   -Free water flushes just increased to 250cc q4. Continues to be
   hypernatremic. Morning electrolytes still pending. Will f/u morning
   electrolytes, increase free water flushes as needed.
   #Decreased albumin: Measuring prealbumin. Patient most likely
   chronically malnourished given long hospital course. Tube feeds via PEG
   tube, f/u prealbumin.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant past medical history of COPD, currently admitted to the ICU for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has been through multiple complications during his hospital course, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, tracheostomy placement, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and recent use of home oxygen for less than a month.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory status: The patient was able to climb stairs and walk 0.5 miles before hospitalization but is now on CPAP/PSV mode with a tracheostomy tube, indicating severe respiratory compromise.
- Temperature: The patient has a low-grade fever of 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit.
- Heart rate: The patient is tachycardic with a heart rate of 113 beats per minute.
- Blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits.
- Oxygen saturation: The patient maintains a normal oxygen saturation level of 100% on FiO2 of 30%.
- Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,600 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 2,325 mL through various routes. The patient's central line has been pulled.
- Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and there"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history of COPD, who presented to the ICU with multiple complications. The patient has been hospitalized for a long duration and has experienced respiratory failure, presumed seizure, elevated troponins, leukocytosis, anasarca, eosinophilia, anemia, right eye injection/macular orbital rash, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, decreased albumin, and pressure ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and previous tracheostomy for failure to wean from the ventilator indicate a high risk for ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Seizure: The patient had a presumed seizure episode, which could be due to various causes such as electrolyte imbalances or an underlying neurological condition.
3. Elevated Troponins: The elevated troponin levels suggest potential cardiac ischemia, although the cardiac evaluation did not recommend emergent cardiac catheterization.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a previous colonization with GNR bacteria, which may indicate a risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
5. Anasarca: The patient's edema and weight gain during hospitalization suggest fluid overload, which can lead to complications like heart failure or renal dysfunction.
6. Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophilia could be secondary to parasitic infection or drug"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  Bronch at OSH with
   ?tracheobronchomalacia.  IP plans to preform flexible bronchoscopy
   which can happen any time now as he is medically stable. From OSH
   ?Aspergillus in sputum, ?ABPA. Per family report, patient using home O2
   for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he was not
   that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   -IP following, will plan on flex bronchoscopy; patient is now medically
   clear
   -f/u IgE levels Aspergillus
   - formal airway CT today
   - wean from vent
   #. Seizure: Presumed seizure since he was unresponsive and twitching.
   No further episodes.
   - EEG pending
   - CT head
   #. Elevated troponins: No CP, Trops stable.  Cards eval, and does not
   require emergent cardiac catheterization. Possible demand ischemia, in
   setting of tachycardia and hypotension.   Beta blocker started
   yesterday.  Lipids normal. Continues tachycardic.  Given concern for
   demand ischemia, will send another troponin today (EKG changes have
   resolved) and see if these are stable or if they are trending down. If
   increasing, will increase beta blocker to decrease demand ischemia
   -Continue ASA
   -When HR decreased so that pacer spikes can be viewed consider EP
   consult
   -Check troponin
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   #. Leukocytosis: Trending down still. Patient had mild temperature
   overnight (100.3), sputum culture shows 2 species GNR.  Colonization vs
   infection. Patient also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff
   neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled. In setting of new fevers, will
   pan-culture again out of concern for possible new infection given that
   patient has been afebrile so far in hosp.
   -repeat pan culture
   -SC tip pending
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to
   Lasix 80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission to OSH (presumably dry
   weight) was 62 kg.  On Lasix gtt now, very negative already today so
   monitor closely to make sure that he does not become hypotensive. Upper
   arms seem more swollen than lower extremities, will get U/S to r/o DVT
   of upper extremities.
   - Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day
   - Low dose lasix gtt
   - upper extremity u/s to r/o DVT
   #. Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia which normalized
   now 14%. Concern for adrenal insufficiency, [**Last Name (un) **] stim test +. Recent
   travel to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be secondary to parasitic infection; however,
   O&P neg TD.  Also concern for drug reaction
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Anemia: Hct stable, likely anemia of chronic disease given long
   hospital course; iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and
   increased ferritin.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Patient does describe pain
   in right eye, pain with movement, and difficulty with vision. Patient
   was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH, initially on Acyclovir, but optho
   felt that not consistent with herpetic eye involvement, most likely
   chronic conjunctival chemosis. Currently no vesicular rash around eye
   so nothing to biopsy.
   -Ophtho consult today.
   #. Elevated alk phos: Alk phos elevated at 236 on admission, trending
   down to 187 on [**11-13**]. Most likely secondary to shock liver, now
   resolving.
   -Continue to monitor
   #Hypokalemia: Resolved.
   #Hypernatremia: 148
   -Free water flushes just increased to 250cc q4. Continues to be
   hypernatremic. Morning electrolytes still pending. Will f/u morning
   electrolytes, increase free water flushes as needed.
   -Electrolytes again at 4pm today
   #Decreased albumin: Measuring prealbumin. Patient most likely
   chronically malnourished given long hospital course. Tube feeds via PEG
   tube, f/u prealbumin.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant past medical history of COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and tracheobronchomalacia, for which he underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He failed to wean from the ventilator, leading to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Seizure: The patient experienced an episode of unresponsiveness and twitching, which was presumed to be a seizure. However, further episodes have not been reported.

3. Elevated Troponins: The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. However, the cardiac catheterization did not reveal any significant coronary artery disease, and the patient's symptoms improved with beta-blocker therapy.

4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient tested positive for adrenal insufficiency on corticotropin stimulation test. He is being treated with prednisone.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count, which has been trending down. There is a concern for colonization or infection, especially with the presence of fevers and GNR species in the sputum culture.

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronciectasis.  Bronch at OSH with
   ?tracheobronchomalacia.  IP plans to preform flexible bronchoscopy once
   medically stabilized, which from our stand point he is. From OSH
   ?Aspergillus in sputum, ?ABPA. Per family report, patient using home O2
   for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he was not
   that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   -IP following, will plan on flex bronchoscopy; patient is now medically
   clear
   -f/u IgE levels Aspergillus
   - formal airway CT today
   - wean from vent
   #. Seizure: Presumed seizure since he was unresponsive and twitching.
   No further episodes.
   - EEG pending
   - CT head
   #. Elevated troponins: No CP, Trops stable.  Cards eval, and does not
   require emergent cardiac catheterization. Possible demand ischemia, in
   setting of tachycardia and hypotension.   Beta blocker started
   yesterday.  Lipids normal. Continues tachycardic.  Given concern for
   demand ischemia, will send another troponin today (EKG changes have
   resolved) and see if these are stable or if they are trending down. If
   increasing, will increase beta blocker to decrease demand ischemia
   -Continue ASA
   -When HR decreased so that pacer spikes can be viewed consider EP
   consult
   -Check troponin
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   #. Leukocytosis: Trending down still. Patient had mild temperature
   overnight (100.3), sputum culture shows 2 species GNR.  Colonization vs
   infection. Patient also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff
   neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled. In setting of new fevers, will
   pan-culture again out of concern for possible new infection given that
   patient has been afebrile so far in hosp.
   -repeat pan culture
   -SC tip pending
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to
   Lasix 80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission to OSH (presumably dry
   weight) was 62 kg.  On Lasix gtt now, very negative already today so
   monitor closely to make sure that he does not become hypotensive. Upper
   arms seem more swollen than lower extremities, will get U/S to r/o DVT
   of upper extremities.
   - Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day
   - Low dose lasix gtt
   -upper extremity u/s to r/o DVT
   #. Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia which normalized
   now 14%. Concern for adrenal insufficiency, [**Last Name (un) **] stim test +. Recent
   travel to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be secondary to parasitic infection; however,
   O&P neg TD.  Also concern for drug reaction
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Anemia: Hct stable, likely anemia of chronic disease given long
   hospital course; iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and
   increased ferritin.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Patient does describe pain
   in right eye, pain with movement, and difficulty with vision. Patient
   was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH, initially on Acyclovir, but optho
   felt that not consistent with herpetic eye involvement, most likely
   chronic conjunctival chemosis. Currently no vesicular rash around eye
   so nothing to biopsy.
   -Ophtho consult today.
   #. Elevated alk phos: Alk phos elevated at 236 on admission, trending
   down to 187 on [**11-13**]. Most likely secondary to shock liver, now
   resolving.
   -Continue to monitor
   #Hypokalemia: Resolved.
   #Hypernatremia: 148
   -Free water flushes just increased to 250cc q4. Continues to be
   hypernatremic. Morning electrolytes still pending. Will f/u morning
   electrolytes, increase free water flushes as needed.
   -Electrolytes again at 4pm today
   #Decreased albumin: Measuring prealbumin. Patient most likely
   chronically malnourished given long hospital course. Tube feeds via PEG
   tube, f/u prealbumin.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant past medical history of COPD and a recent hospital course at another facility for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia. He was sent from the other facility for an interventional procedure. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to COPD and failure to wean from the ventilator, as well as bronchiectasis. There is also a suspicion of Aspergillus infection in the sputum and possible allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).

The patient experienced a presumed seizure with unresponsiveness and twitching, but no further episodes occurred. An EEG is pending, and a CT head will be performed. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, but there are no signs of coronary artery disease, and the patient does not require emergent cardiac catheterization. A beta-blocker has been started, and another troponin test will be done today to check for stability or increasing levels. If increasing, the beta-blocker dose will be increased to decrease demand ischemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency based on a positive corticotropin stimulation test. Prednisone has been started at 5 mg PO daily. The patient also has leukocytosis, which is trending down. There is mild temperature overnight, and sputum culture shows two species of gram-negative rods. Colonization versus infection is being considered, and a"

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  Bronch at OSH with
   ?tracheobronchomalacia. . CT showed b/l pleural effusions, small/mod on
   right, small on left, diffuse mild bronchial wall thickening and small
   clusters of centrilobular nodules and peribronchovascular ground glass
   opacities suggesting recent infection/inflammation or possibly
   aspiration. Most likely secondary to previous VAP at OSH. No radiologic
   evidence of TBM  From OSH ? Aspergillus in sputum, ?ABPA. Per family
   report, patient using home O2 for less than one month prior to going to
   hospital, seems he was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent
   hospitalization.
   -IP following, if definitively no stenting will inform pulmonologist at
   OSH
   -f/u IgE levels Aspergillus
   - wean from vent
   #. Seizure: Presumed seizure since he was unresponsive and twitching.
   No further episodes. EEG initial report shows no epileptiform activity,
   diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy
   - EEG pending
   - CT head
   #. Elevated troponins: No CP; cardiology saw him on arrival, feel does
   not require emergent cardiac catheterization, recommend medical
   management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of tachycardia and
   hypotension.   Troponin elevated yesterday to 0.59, metoprolol was
   increased out of concern for likely demand ischemia. Also may have poor
   renal function without elevated creatinine in the setting of very
   little muscle mass. Continues tachycardic, slightly improved.
   -Continue ASA
   -When HR decreased so that pacer spikes can be viewed consider EP
   consult
   -Check troponin again and EKG
   -Continue Metoprolol 37.5 TID
   -If troponins trending up will get cardiology consult
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   #. Leukocytosis: Trending down still. Patient febrile yesterday to
   101.1, pancultured. No growth to date from any blood or urine.  Sputum
   culture + for pseudomonas; sputum gram stain from yesterday continues +
   for GNR. Colonization vs infection. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no
   growth to date.

   #. Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to
   Lasix 80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission to OSH (presumably dry
   weight) was 62 kg.  No occlusive DVT in upper extremities. On lasix gtt
   for most of yesterday, net negative significantly but then became
   hypotensive.
   -Restart lasix gtt this am, very gentle diuresis
   - Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day (goal for
   today: -500mL)
   #. Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia which normalized,
   then at presentation to [**Hospital1 19**] at 14%. Now trending down to 8% on
   prednisone, most likely eosinophilia secondary to adrenal
   insufficiency. Recent travel to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be secondary to
   parasitic infection; however, O&P neg TD.  Also concern for drug
   reaction
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Anemia: Hct stable, likely anemia of chronic disease given long
   hospital course; iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and
   increased ferritin.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Patient does describe pain
   in right eye, pain with movement, and difficulty with vision. Patient
   was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH, initially on Acyclovir, but optho

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male with a significant medical history of COPD, who has been through a long hospital course with multiple complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and possible tracheobronchomalacia. The patient was sent from OSH for IP assessment for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's current health issues include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and was intubated for failure to wean from the ventilator. A CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusions, diffuse mild bronchial wall thickening, and small clusters of centrilobular nodules and peribronchovascular ground glass opacities suggesting recent infection/inflammation or possibly aspiration. No radiologic evidence of tuberculosis (TBM) was found. The patient also has bronchiectasis and is being evaluated for tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 30% and is expected to be weaned off the ventilator.

2. Seizure: The patient had a presumed seizure characterized by unresponsiveness and twitching. No further episodes have been reported. An electroencephalogram (EEG) initially showed no epileptiform activity but revealed diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy. A pending EEG report is expected.

3. Elevated Troponins: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, which may be due to demand ischemia caused by tachycardia and hypotension. Cardiology reviewed the patient and recommended medical management instead of emergent cardiac catheterization. The patient is currently on metoprolol 37.5 TID and will continue to be monitored.

4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient tested positive for corticotropin synthesis, indicating adrenal insufficiency. Prednisone 5mg PO daily is being administered.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and he is febrile. He has been pancultured, and no growth has been detected. Sputum culture grew pseudomonas, and the gram stain from yesterday is positive for GNR. Colonization versus infection is being considered. Central line from OSH has been pulled, and no growth has been detected.

6. Anasarca: The patient has generalized edema and has been receiving diuretics. Lasix was stopped due to hypotension but will be restarted gently.

7. Eosinophilia: The patient initially presented with eosinophilia, which has now normalized. It may be secondary to adrenal insufficiency or a parasitic infection. Drug reaction is also a concern.

8. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable, likely due to anemia of chronic disease. Iron studies are consistent with decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and increased ferritin.

9. Right Eye Injection/Macular Orbital Rash: The patient has pain in the right eye, pain with movement"

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  Bronch at OSH with
   ?tracheobronchomalacia. . CT showed b/l pleural effusions, small/mod on
   right, small on left, diffuse mild bronchial wall thickening and small
   clusters of centrilobular nodules and peribronchovascular ground glass
   opacities suggesting recent infection/inflammation or possibly
   aspiration. Most likely secondary to previous VAP at OSH. No radiologic
   evidence of TBM  From OSH ? Aspergillus in sputum, ?ABPA. Per family
   report, patient using home O2 for less than one month prior to going to
   hospital, seems he was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent
   hospitalization.
   -IP following, if definitively no stenting will inform pulmonologist at
   OSH
   -f/u IgE levels Aspergillus
   - wean from vent
   #. Seizure: Presumed seizure since he was unresponsive and twitching.
   No further episodes. EEG initial report shows no epileptiform activity,
   diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy
   - EEG pending
   - CT head
   #. Elevated troponins: No CP; cardiology saw him on arrival, feel does
   not require emergent cardiac catheterization, recommend medical
   management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of tachycardia and
   hypotension.   Troponin elevated yesterday to 0.59, metoprolol was
   increased out of concern for likely demand ischemia. Also may have poor
   renal function without elevated creatinine in the setting of very
   little muscle mass. Continues tachycardic, slightly improved.
   -Continue ASA
   -When HR decreased so that pacer spikes can be viewed consider EP
   consult
   -Check troponin again and EKG
   -Continue Metoprolol 37.5 TID
   -If troponins trending up will get cardiology consult
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   #. Leukocytosis: Trending down still. Patient febrile yesterday to
   101.1, pancultured. No growth to date from any blood or urine.  Sputum
   culture + for pseudomonas; sputum gram stain from yesterday continues +
   for GNR. Colonization vs infection. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no
   growth to date.
   -SC tip pending
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to
   Lasix 80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission to OSH (presumably dry
   weight) was 62 kg.  No occlusive DVT in upper extremities. On lasix gtt
   for most of yesterday, net negative significantly but then became
   hypotensive.
   -Restart lasix gtt this am, very gentle diuresis
   - Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day (goal for
   today: -500mL)
   #. Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia which normalized,
   then at presentation to [**Hospital1 19**] at 14%. Now trending down to 8% on
   prednisone, most likely eosinophilia secondary to adrenal
   insufficiency. Recent travel to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be secondary to
   parasitic infection; however, O&P neg TD.  Also concern for drug
   reaction
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Anemia: Hct stable, likely anemia of chronic disease given long
   hospital course; iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and
   increased ferritin.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Patient does describe pain
   in right eye, pain with movement, and difficulty with vision. Patient
   was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH, initially on Acyclovir, but optho
   felt that not consistent with herpetic eye involvement, most likely
   chronic conjunctival chemosis. Currently no vesicular rash around eye
   so nothing to biopsy.
   -Consider ophtho consult
   #Decreased albumin: Measuring prealbumin. Patient most likely
   chronically malnourished given long hospital course. Tube feeds via PEG
   tube, f/u prealbumin.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].

   Assessment and Plan
   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  Bronch at OSH with
   ?tracheobronchomalacia.  From OSH ? Aspergillus in sputum, ?ABPA. Per
   family report, patient using home O2 for less than one month prior to
   going to hospital, seems he was not that limited by COPD prior to most
   recent hospitalization. CT showed b/l pleural effusions, small/mod on
   right, small on left, diffuse mild bronchial wall thickening and small
   clusters of centrilobular nodules and peribronchovascular ground glass
   opacities suggesting recent infection/inflammation or possibly
   aspiration. Most likely secondary to previous VAP at OSH. No radiologic
   evidence of TBM.
   -IP following, if definitively no stenting will inform pulmonologist at
   OSH
   -f/u IgE levels Aspergillus
   - wean from vent
   #. Seizure: Presumed seizure since he was unresponsive and twitching.
   No further episodes. EEG initial report shows no epileptiform activity,
   diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy
   - EEG pending
   - CT head
   #. Elevated troponins: No CP; cardiology saw him on arrival, feel does
   not require emergent cardiac catheterization, recommend medical
   management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of tachycardia and
   hypotension.   Troponin elevated yesterday to 0.59, metoprolol was
   increased out of concern for likely demand ischemia. Continues
   tachycardic, slightly improved.
   -Continue ASA
   -When HR decreased so that pacer spikes can be viewed consider EP
   consult
   -Check troponin again and EKG
   -Continue Metoprolol 37.5 TID
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   #. Leukocytosis: Trending down still. Patient febrile yesterday to
   101.1, pancultured. No growth to date from any blood or urine.  Sputum
   culture + for pseudomonas; sputum gram stain from yesterday continues +
   for GNR. Colonization vs infection. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no
   growth to date.
   -SC tip pending
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to
   Lasix 80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission to OSH (presumably dry
   weight) was 62 kg.  No occlusive DVT in upper extremities. On lasix gtt
   for most of yesterday, net negative significantly but then became
   hypotensive.
   -Restart lasix gtt this am, very gentle diuresis
   - Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day
   #. Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia which normalized,
   then at presentation to [**Hospital1 19**] at 14%. Now trending down to 8% on
   prednisone, most likely eosinophilia secondary to adrenal
   insufficiency. Recent travel to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be secondary to
   parasitic infection; however, O&P neg TD.  Also concern for drug
   reaction
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Anemia: Hct stable, likely anemia of chronic disease given long
   hospital course; iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and
   increased ferritin.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Patient does describe pain
   in right eye, pain with movement, and difficulty with vision. Patient
   was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH, initially on Acyclovir, but optho
   felt that not consistent with herpetic eye involvement, most likely
   chronic conjunctival chemosis. Currently no vesicular rash around eye
   so nothing to biopsy.
   -Consider ophtho consult
   #Decreased albumin: Measuring prealbumin. Patient most likely
   chronically malnourished given long hospital course. Tube feeds via PEG
   tube, f/u prealbumin.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and multiple medical complications. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, seizures, elevated troponins, adrenal insufficiency, leukocytosis, anasarca, eosinophilia, anemia, right eye injection/macular orbital rash, decreased albumin, and ulcers. He is currently receiving various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and tracheostomy for failure to wean from the ventilator puts him at risk for ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Seizures: The patient had a presumed seizure episode, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and prevent future seizures.
3. Elevated Troponins: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest possible demand ischemia, which could be due to tachycardia and hypotension. Continuous cardiac monitoring and medical management are recommended.
4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient tested positive for adrenal insufficiency, and he is currently receiving corticosteroid replacement therapy.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. Cultures have been obtained, and appropriate antibiotics have been started.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history including COPD, recent hospitalization for multiple complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient was sent from the previous hospital for interventional pulmonology (IP) assessment for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and previously failed weaning from the ventilator. He also has bronchiectasis. The CT scan showed bilateral pleural effusions, mild bronchial wall thickening, and clusters of centrilobular nodules and peribronchovascular ground glass opacities, suggesting recent infection/inflammation or possibly aspiration. No radiologic evidence of tuberculosis (TBM) was found.

2. Seizure: The patient experienced a presumed seizure, with unresponsiveness and twitching. An EEG initially showed no epileptiform activity, but there was diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy. Further EEG results are pending, and a CT head is also needed.

3. Elevated Troponins: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may be due to demand ischemia in the setting of tachycardia and hypotension. The cardiology team does not recommend emergent cardiac"

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  Bronch at OSH with
   ?tracheobronchomalacia. . CT showed b/l pleural effusions, small/mod on
   right, small on left, diffuse mild bronchial wall thickening and small
   clusters of centrilobular nodules and peribronchovascular ground glass
   opacities suggesting recent infection/inflammation or possibly
   aspiration. Most likely secondary to previous VAP at OSH. No radiologic
   evidence of TBM  From OSH ? Aspergillus in sputum, ?ABPA. Per family
   report, patient using home O2 for less than one month prior to going to
   hospital, seems he was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent
   hospitalization.
   -IP following, if definitively no stenting will inform pulmonologist at
   OSH
   -f/u IgE levels Aspergillus
   - wean from vent
   #. Seizure: Presumed seizure since he was unresponsive and twitching.
   No further episodes. EEG initial report shows no epileptiform activity,
   diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy
   - EEG pending
   - CT head
   #. Elevated troponins: No CP; cardiology saw him on arrival, feel does
   not require emergent cardiac catheterization, recommend medical
   management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of tachycardia and
   hypotension.   Troponin elevated yesterday to 0.59, metoprolol was
   increased out of concern for likely demand ischemia. Also may have poor
   renal function without elevated creatinine in the setting of very
   little muscle mass. Continues tachycardic, slightly improved.
   -Continue ASA
   -When HR decreased so that pacer spikes can be viewed consider EP
   consult
   -Check troponin again and EKG
   -Continue Metoprolol 37.5 TID
   -If troponins trending up will get cardiology consult
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   #. Leukocytosis: Trending down still. Patient febrile yesterday to
   101.1, pancultured. No growth to date from any blood or urine.  Sputum
   culture + for pseudomonas; sputum gram stain from yesterday continues +
   for GNR. Colonization vs infection. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no
   growth to date.
   -SC tip pending
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Anasarca: Patient was receiving diuresis at OSH; received up to
   Lasix 80mg IV BID, then changed to Bumex, which was then d/c'd for
   hypotension. Patient
s weight on admission to OSH (presumably dry
   weight) was 62 kg.  No occlusive DVT in upper extremities. On lasix gtt
   for most of yesterday, net negative significantly but then became
   hypotensive.
   -Restart lasix gtt this am, very gentle diuresis
   - Will try to keep patient mildly net negative each day (goal for
   today: -500mL)
   #. Eosinophilia: Presented to OSH with eosinophilia which normalized,
   then at presentation to [**Hospital1 19**] at 14%. Now trending down to 8% on
   prednisone, most likely eosinophilia secondary to adrenal
   insufficiency. Recent travel to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be secondary to
   parasitic infection; however, O&P neg TD.  Also concern for drug
   reaction
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Anemia: Hct stable, likely anemia of chronic disease given long
   hospital course; iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and
   increased ferritin.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Patient does describe pain
   in right eye, pain with movement, and difficulty with vision. Patient
   was seen by ID & opthomology at OSH, initially on Acyclovir, but optho
   felt that not consistent with herpetic eye involvement, most likely
   chronic conjunctival chemosis. Currently no vesicular rash around eye
   so nothing to biopsy.
   -Consider ophtho consult
   #Decreased albumin: Measuring prealbumin. Patient most likely
   chronically malnourished given long hospital course. Tube feeds via PEG
   tube, f/u prealbumin.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].
   -Wound care consult
   -Optimize nutrition
   -Frequent repositioning
   #. FEN: Tube feeds via PEG tube, free water flushes 250 cc q4
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with: Heparin SQ
   -Bowel regimen
   -Pain management with
   #. ACCESS: PICC

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  Bronch at OSH with
   ?tracheobronchomalacia, but the CT here showed only findings suggestive
   of infection and no TBM.   Notes from OSH repeatedly bring up ?
   Aspergillus in sputum, ?ABPA, but not seen on testing. Per family
   report, patient using home O2 for less than one month prior to going to
   hospital, seems he was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent
   hospitalization.
   -IP does not want to stent.  We will discuss this with his OSH
   pulmonologist.
   - He appears euvolemic on exam.  We should titrate his lasix with goal
   being even I/O
s today.
   -f/u IgE levels Aspergillus
   - wean from vent as much as possible.  Should get trial of trach mask
   today.
   #. Seizure: One morning had what appeared to be a seizure since he was
   unresponsive and twitching.  No further episodes. EEG initial report
   shows no epileptiform activity, diffuse slowing consistent with
   encephalopathy .  If this recurs we could check a CT head.
   #. Elevated troponins: No CP; cardiology saw him on arrival, felt he
   did not require emergent cardiac catheterization, recommend medical
   management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of tachycardia and
   hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to 0.61, metoprolol
   was increased out of concern for likely demand ischemia.  Could have
   poor renal function without elevated creatinine in the setting of very
   little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Consult EP with possibility of slowing pacing to allow for more
   effective beta blockade.
   -Check troponin again and EKG
   -Continue Metoprolol 37.5 TID
   -If troponins trending up will get cardiology consult
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   - Consult endocrinology for further management.
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile with slowly improving leukocytosis.  Has
   had yeast and pseudomonas on urine and sputum cultures, likely
   colonizers. Patient also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff
   neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Anasarca: Improved, though he continues to have UE>LE edema.  An
   ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot.
   - Goal today is even to slightly negative with lasix prn.
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal
   -Minimize unecassary medications (d/c
d antibiotics, PPI, diuretics,
   betablocker)
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Anemia: Hct stable, likely anemia of chronic disease given long
   hospital course; iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and
   increased ferritin.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Decreased albumin: Measuring prealbumin. Patient most likely
   chronically malnourished given long hospital course. Tube feeds via PEG
   tube.  Prealbumin is slightly depressed, but not extremely low,
   suggesting he is receiving adequate nutrition now.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history of COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU for multiple complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, and tracheostomy placement. He was sent from another hospital for assessment for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including chronic pleural effusion, chronic anemia, rash, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without acute exacerbation, seizure without status epilepticus, hypernatremia (high sodium), electrolyte & fluid disorder, impaired nutrition, myocardial infarction (heart attack), and airway protection issues.

The patient's recent hospital course has been complicated by VAP, failure to wean from the ventilator, tracheostomy placement, and suspected Aspergillus infection. The patient's family reports that he has been using home oxygen for less than a month prior to hospitalization and seems not to be limited by COPD prior to the most recent hospitalization.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 115/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilatory support. His current medications include furosemide (Lasix) at 5 mg/hour"

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   -IP does not want to stent.  We will discuss this with his OSH
   pulmonologist.
   - He appears euvolemic on exam.  Goal yesterday was even, but patient
   was positive yesterday. Negative this AM.
   - wean from vent as much as possible.  Trial of trach mask went well,
   but then needed some pressure support
   #. Elevated troponins: No CP; cardiology saw him on arrival, felt he
   did not require emergent cardiac catheterization, recommend medical
   management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of tachycardia and
   hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to 0.61, Metoprolol
   was increased out of concern for likely demand ischemia.  Could have
   poor renal function without elevated creatinine in the setting of very
   little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 37.5 TID
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs.
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile.  Has had yeast and pseudomonas on urine
   and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no
   growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Anasarca: Improved, though he continues to have UE>LE edema.  An
   ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot.  Lasix given overnight
   made slightly negative this AM.
   - Goal today is even to slightly negative with lasix prn.
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Anemia: Hct stable, likely anemia of chronic disease given long
   hospital course; iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and
   increased ferritin.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.
   #. FEN: Tube feeds via PEG tube, free water flushes 250 cc q4

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant past medical history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He had a prolonged hospital course with multiple complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, and tracheostomy placement. The patient's family reports that he has been using home oxygen for less than a month prior to hospitalization and was not significantly limited by COPD before the recent hospitalization.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and required tracheostomy due to failure to wean from the ventilator. A CT scan showed only findings suggestive of infection and no tracheobronchomalacia. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 30%.
- Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cosyntropin stimulation test was positive for adrenal insufficiency. Baseline morning ACTH, cortisol, and PRA levels were obtained, followed by administration of 250mcg cosyntropin, with repeat labs at 30 and 60 minutes.
- Peripheral edema: The patient appears euvolemic on examination, with 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities. Negative fluid balance overnight.
- Chronic pleural effusion: The patient has a history of chronic pleural effusion.
- Anemia: The"

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   -IP does not want to stent.  We will discuss this with his OSH
   pulmonologist.
   - He appears euvolemic on exam.  Goal yesterday was even, but patient
   was positive yesterday. Negative this AM.
   - wean from vent as much as possible.  Trial of trach mask went well,
   but then needed some pressure support
   #. Elevated troponins: No CP; cardiology saw him on arrival, felt he
   did not require emergent cardiac catheterization, recommend medical
   management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of tachycardia and
   hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to 0.61, Metoprolol
   was increased out of concern for likely demand ischemia.  Could have
   poor renal function without elevated creatinine in the setting of very
   little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 37.5 TID
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs.
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile.  Has had yeast and pseudomonas on urine
   and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no
   growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Anasarca: Improved, though he continues to have UE>LE edema.  An
   ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot.  Lasix given overnight
   made slightly negative this AM.
   - Goal today is even to slightly negative with lasix prn.
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Anemia: Hct stable, likely anemia of chronic disease given long
   hospital course; iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and
   increased ferritin.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history of COPD, who has been experiencing multiple complications during his hospital stay. These include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient was sent from the operating room (OSH) for further assessment for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and has undergone tracheostomy for failure to wean from the ventilator. Bronchiectasis is also present. Despite using home oxygen for less than a month prior to hospitalization, the patient does not seem severely limited by COPD. The attending physician does not want to stent the tracheobronchomalacia at this time and plans to discuss it with the patient's OSH pulmonologist.

2. Seizure: The patient experienced an episode of unresponsiveness and twitching, which appeared to be a seizure. An initial EEG report showed no epileptiform activity but diffuse slowing consistent with encephalopathy. If this recurs, a CT head may be considered.

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   Able to tolerate 6 hours on trache mask yesterday.
   - He appears euvolemic on exam.  Goal yesterday was negative 500mL, but
   patient was positive yesterday; as SBP 100-140, can give Lasix 40mg IV
   this morning and follow UOP
   - wean from vent
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs.
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anasarca: Improved, though he continues to have UE>LE edema.  An
   ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot.  Lasix given overnight
   made slightly negative this AM.
   - Goal today is negative as tolerated by blood pressure.
   -Give Lasix 40mg IV this morning and follow UOP.
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin.
   However, given more significant decrease today would like to guiaic
   stool and check reticulocyte count to ensure that bone marrow response
   appropriate.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   -Guiaic stool
   -Retic count
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 37.5 TID
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile.  Has had yeast and pseudomonas on urine
   and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no
   growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.
   #. FEN: Tube feeds via PEG tube, free water flushes 250 cc q4
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with: Heparin SQ and pneumoboots.
   -Bowel regimen PRN
   -Ulcer ppx with ranitidine.
   #. ACCESS: PICC
   #. CODE STATUS: No right heart cath, full code.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and multiple complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, tracheostomy (trach) placement, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. He was sent from the outside hospital (OSH) for inpatient assessment for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 580 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. His respiratory support requirements indicate potential respiratory failure due to COPD and bronchiectasis, although the recent CT scan did not show findings suggestive of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 beats per minute and hypotension with a blood pressure of 104/54 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is maintained at 98% on the ventilator. The patient's physical examination reveals peripheral edema and chronic pleural effusion.

The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, as indicated by a positive corticotropin stimulation test. He has been prescribed prednisone 5 mg orally daily and will require an outpatient appointment with an"

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean from
   ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   - He appears euvolemic on exam.  Goal yesterday was negative 500mL, but
   patient was positive yesterday; as SBP 100-140, can give Lasix 40mg IV
   this morning and follow UOP
   - wean from vent as much as possible.  Trial of trach mask went well,
   but then needed some pressure support
   #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs.
   -Prednisone 5mg PO daily
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anasarca: Improved, though he continues to have UE>LE edema.  An
   ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot.  Lasix given overnight
   made slightly negative this AM.
   - Goal today is negative as tolerated by blood pressure.
   -Give Lasix 40mg IV this morning and follow UOP.
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin.
   However, given more significant decrease today would like to guiaic
   stool and check reticulocyte count to ensure that bone marrow response
   appropriate.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   -Guiaic stool
   -Retic count
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 37.5 TID
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile.  Has had yeast and pseudomonas on urine
   and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no
   growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.
   #. FEN: Tube feeds via PEG tube, free water flushes 250 cc q4
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with: Heparin SQ and pneumoboots.
   -Bowel regimen PRN
   -Ulcer ppx with ranitidine.

   #. CODE STATUS: No right heart cath, full code.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant past medical history of COPD, who has been hospitalized for a long period of time with multiple complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheostomy placement, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He was sent from the other hospital for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues including respiratory failure due to COPD and failure to wean from the ventilator. He also has chronic pleural effusion, chronic anemia, rash, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), seizure without status epilepticus, hypernatremia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered nutrition, myocardial infarction, impaired skin integrity, and airway protection issues.

The patient's current assessment and plan include adrenal insufficiency, peripheral edema, chronic anemia, tachycardia, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, right eye injection/macular orbital rash, ulcers, and pressure ulcer care. He is receiving various medications including corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency, diuretics for fluid management, and antibiotics for suspected infections.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. His electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106"

   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history of COPD, who has been in the ICU for a long hospital course with multiple complications. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and was sent from another hospital for assessment for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure due to COPD and failure to wean from the ventilator, elevated troponins with no cardiac catheterization required, adrenal insufficiency confirmed by corticotropin stimulation test, leukocytosis with colonization of yeast and pseudomonas in urine and sputum cultures, anasarca with edema, eosinophilia, anemia of chronic disease, right eye injection/macular orbital rash, and ulcers on sacrum/coccyx and left ear helix.

The patient's treatment plan includes medical management for cardiac condition, prednisone for adrenal insufficiency, monitoring for fever curve, Lasix for fluid management, minimizing unnecessary medications, daily HCT monitoring, active T&S, wound care, and repositioning for ulcers, tube feeds via PEG tube, DVT prophylaxis, bowel regimen PRN, ulcer prophylaxis with ranitidine, and full code status.

   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.  Has
   been tolerating trach mask well

   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anasarca: Improved, though he continues to have UE>LE edema.  An
   ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot.
   --Goal today is negative as blood pressure can tolerate
   --Is only slightly negative through [**Location 11298**] 40mg IV this am
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin.
   However, given more significant decrease today would like to guiaic
   stool and check reticulocyte count to ensure that bone marrow response
   appropriate.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile.  Has had yeast and pseudomonas on urine
   and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, chronic anemia, peripheral edema, and chronic pleural effusion. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has multiple medical complications including adrenal insufficiency, anasarca, tachycardia, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, right eye injection/macular orbital rash, ulcers, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency, which requires ongoing monitoring and treatment with corticosteroids.
2. Anasarca: The patient has generalized edema, indicating anasarca. This condition may be related to hypoalbuminemia and requires further evaluation and management.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be due to demand ischemia, especially in the setting of hypotension. It is important to monitor his cardiac status and continue medical management.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with colonization of yeast and pseudomonas in urine and sputum cultures. This may indicate a risk of infection, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent and treat any potential infections.
5. Eosinophilia: The patient's elevated eosinophil count could be due to medications or adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring and minimizing unnecessary medications are necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant past medical history of COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU for multiple complications. These complications include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and potential tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has been tolerating the tracheostomy well and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with 30% FiO2.

The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed. First, there is a suspicion of adrenal insufficiency, which has been confirmed by a cosyntropin stimulation test. The patient is currently on prednisone 5mg PO daily, but further follow-up with the endocrine team is needed to determine the appropriate dosage and frequency.

Second, the patient has edema, specifically peripheral edema and pleural effusion. An ultrasound has ruled out an obstructive clot, and the patient has been given Lasix 40mg IV to manage the edema as tolerated.

Third, the patient has anemia, likely due to anemia of chronic disease. However, the recent significant decrease in hemoglobin warrants further investigation, including a guaiac stool test and reticulocyte count.

Fourth, the patient has been tachycardic with elevated troponin levels, suggesting possible demand ischemia. Cardiology has"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, who has been hospitalized for multiple complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheostomy placement, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and potential tracheobronchomalacia stenting. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and failure to wean from the ventilator. He also has a history of chronic pleural effusion, chronic anemia, rash, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), seizure, hypernatremia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, and airway protection issues.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and has undergone tracheostomy for failure to wean from the ventilator. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with 30% FiO2 and tolerating the tracheostomy mask well.
- Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has tested positive for adrenal insufficiency using cosyntropin stimulation test. Baseline morning ACTH, cortisol, PRA, and other relevant labs have been ordered, and the patient is to receive 250mcg cosyntropin followed by the same labs at 30 and 60 minutes. The patient is currently on prednisone 5mg PO daily, but the dosage needs to be adjusted based on endocrine recommendations.

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
    #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs, currently still pending
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily but
   - Need to touch base with Endocrine about predisone dose
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anasarca: Improved, though he continues to have UE>LE edema.  An
   ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot.  BUN and Cr stable,
   seem to be tolerating aggressive diuresis
   --Goal today is 1-1.5L negative
   --Lasix 40mg IV bid
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased
   ferritin.Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile.  Has had yeast and pseudomonas on urine
   and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no
   growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated, though trending down (today 7.1%). [**Month (only) 51**]
   be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
    #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs, currently still pending
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily but
   - Need to touch base with Endocrine about predisone dose
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anasarca: Improved, though he continues to have UE>LE edema.  An
   ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot.  BUN and Cr stable,
   seem to be tolerating aggressive diuresis
   --Goal today is 1-1.5L negative
   --Lasix 40mg IV bid
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased
   ferritin.Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile.  Has had yeast and pseudomonas on urine
   and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no
   growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated, though trending down (today 7.1%). [**Month (only) 51**]
   be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), adrenal insufficiency, anemia of chronic disease, peripheral edema, pleural effusion, chronic, and hypernatremia. He has been hospitalized for a long duration and has experienced multiple complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, and tracheostomy placement. The patient was sent to the ICU for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and has previously required tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ongoing respiratory failure.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's corticotropin stimulation test is positive for adrenal insufficiency. He is currently on prednisone but may require adjustment of the dosage.
3. Anasarca: The patient has peripheral edema but no obstructive clot on ultrasound. His BUN and creatinine levels are stable, and he is tolerating aggressive diuresis.
4. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia of chronic disease. Iron studies are consistent with decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and increased ferritin. The reticulocyte index indicates hypoproliferation.
5. Tachycardia: Elevated troponins indicate possible myocardial"

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.  Has
   been tolerating trach mask well
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
    #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs.
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily for now but will need to touch
   base with Endocrine about this dosage
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anasarca: Improved, though he continues to have UE>LE edema.  An
   ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot.
   --Goal today is negative as blood pressure can tolerate
   --Is only slightly negative through [**Location 11298**] 40mg IV bid
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin.
   -Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile.  Has had yeast and pseudomonas on urine
   and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient also has significant
   history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line from OSH now pulled, no
   growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who has been hospitalized for a long period of time with multiple complications. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and was sent from the outside hospital for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, peripheral edema, chronic pleural effusion, chronic anemia, rash, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without acute exacerbation, seizure without status epilepticus, hypernatremia (high sodium), electrolyte & fluid disorder, alteration in nutrition, myocardial infarction, impaired skin integrity, and inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, cough).

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, eosinophilia, elevated troponins, anemia of chronic disease, hypoproliferative reticulocytosis, decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), increased ferritin, and normal creatinine.

The patient's plan includes continuing weaning from the ventilator, monitoring for signs of infection, managing adrenal insufficiency with cortisone and close follow-up with endocrinology, addressing anemia of chronic disease, managing tachycardia and potential demand ischemia, minimizing unnecessary medications, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and multiple hospitalizations with various complications. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, anasarca, anemia, rash, tachycardia, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, ulcers, and altered nutrition.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and previous failure to wean from the ventilator. This indicates a high risk for continued respiratory failure.

2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency, and the cortisol response to the cosyntropin stimulation test was positive. It is crucial to monitor and manage this condition properly to prevent adrenal crisis.

3. Anasarca: The patient has edema and anasarca, which can lead to fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and aggressive diuresis are necessary to manage this condition.

4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia likely due to anemia of chronic disease. Regular monitoring and appropriate management are needed to address this condition.

5. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia with elevated troponins, indicating possible myocard"

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   Patient did not tolerate trache mask trial well yesterday
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
   -Trache mask trial today, if patient does not tolerate well would get
   CXR to assess for possible worsening
    #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs, currently still pending
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily per endocrine
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anasarca: Improved.  An ultrasound was negative for an obstructive
   clot.  BUN and Cr stable, seem to be tolerating aggressive diuresis
   --Goal today is even/mildly negative
   --Lasix 40mg IV bid
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased
   ferritin.Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile. WBC count trending down.  Has had yeast
   and pseudomonas on urine and sputum cultures, likely colonizers.
   Patient also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central
   line from OSH now pulled, no growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated, though trending down (today 7.1%). [**Month (only) 51**]
   be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.
   #. FEN: Tube feeds via PEG tube, free water flushes 250 cc q4

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant past medical history of COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU for multiple complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient was sent from the operating room (OSH) for interventional procedures, possibly for tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/53 mmHg to 122/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with 30% FiO2.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally, trace edema in the upper extremities, and no lower extremity edema. The patient's right eye appears less red, and there is a macular orbital rash present. The patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on the sacrum/coccyx and stage IV ulcer on the left ear helix, both of which were present on admission.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.0 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, elevated troponin levels indicating possible myocardial infarction, and electrolyte imbalances including hypernatremia.

The patient's assessment and plan include adrenal insufficiency, peripheral edema, chronic pleural effusion, chronic anemia, rash, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without acute exacerbation, seizure without status epilepticus, hypernatremia, altered nutrition, myocardial infarction, impaired skin integrity, and airway protection issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, sepsis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), pressure ulcers, and cardiac events."

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   Patient did not tolerate trache mask trial well yesterday
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
   -Trache mask trial today, if patient does not tolerate well would get
   CXR to assess for possible worsening
    #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs, currently still pending
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily per endocrine
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anasarca: Improved.  An ultrasound was negative for an obstructive
   clot.  BUN and Cr stable, seem to be tolerating aggressive diuresis
   --Goal today is even/mildly negative
   --Lasix 40mg IV bid
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased
   ferritin.Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile. WBC count trending down.  Has had yeast
   and pseudomonas on urine and sputum cultures, likely colonizers.
   Patient also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central
   line from OSH now pulled, no growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated, though trending down (today 7.1%). [**Month (only) 51**]
   be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who has been hospitalized for a long period of time. He has had multiple complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, and tracheostomy placement. The patient was sent from another hospital for assessment for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to COPD and previous tracheostomy. He is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The patient did not tolerate a tracheostomy mask trial well yesterday, so further weaning from the ventilator will continue, and a tracheostomy mask trial will be attempted today. If the patient does not tolerate the trial well, a chest X-ray will be done to assess for possible worsening.

The patient also has adrenal insufficiency, as indicated by a positive corticotropin stimulation test. He is currently on prednisone 5mg per day and will need an outpatient appointment with an endocrinologist for further follow-up.

The patient has anasarca, which has improved, and an ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are stable, and he is tolerating"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), recent hospitalization for multiple complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and tracheostomy placement. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and failure to wean from the ventilator. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient is suspected to have adrenal insufficiency based on a positive corticotropin stimulation test. This condition may require ongoing hormone replacement therapy and careful monitoring of electrolyte imbalances.
3. Edema and Fluid Management: The patient has peripheral edema and anasarca, indicating possible fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuresis is necessary to prevent further fluid accumulation.
4. Anemia: The patient is likely experiencing anemia of chronic disease due to the long hospital stay. Iron studies show decreased TIBC and increased ferritin levels, indicating iron deficiency. Regular monitoring and management of anemia is required.
5. Cardiac Issues: Elevated troponin levels suggest possible myocardial infarction. The patient is at risk for cardiac complications such as ischemia and heart"

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.  Continues
   to fail trache mask trials.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   Patient did not tolerate trache mask trial for past two days. However,
   today patient appears to be doing well on trache mask trial up in
   chair. CXR today current wet read states not changed from previously.
   Make sure that up in chair when trache masking.
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
   -PT consult to work with patient for strength, out of bed.
   #. Anasarca: Improved.  An ultrasound was negative for an obstructive
   clot.  BUN and Cr stable, seem to be tolerating aggressive diuresis
   --Goal today is even/mildly negative  (-250 mL)
   --Lasix 40mg IV bid
    #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs, currently still pending
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily per endocrine
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased
   ferritin.Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile. WBC count stable.  Has had yeast and
   pseudomonas on urine and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient
   also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line
   from OSH now pulled, no growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated, though trending down (14
 7.1%). [**Month (only) 51**] be
   secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   - Check CBC with diff tomorrow
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.
   -Check albumin
   -Make sure that tube feeds optimized.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), previous hospitalizations for respiratory failure, tracheostomy placement, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and multiple complications. He was admitted to the ICU for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia but continues to fail tracheostomy mask trials.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and bronchiectasis, for which he underwent tracheostomy due to failure to wean from the ventilator. He is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with 30% FiO2. The goal is to continue weaning him off the ventilator. Make sure he is up in a chair during trache mask trials.
2. Anasarca: The patient's edema has improved, and an ultrasound ruled out an obstructive clot. He is tolerating aggressive diuresis with Lasix 40mg IV bid. The goal is to maintain an even or mildly negative fluid balance of (-250 mL).
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's corticotropin synthesis test was positive for adrenal insufficiency. Baseline morning ACTH, cortisol, PRA, and [**Male First Name (un)**] were ordered, followed by 250mcg Cosyntropin administration, with the same labs at 30"

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and has undergone tracheostomy due to failure to wean from the ventilator. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with 30% FiO2. The CXR shows no change, indicating ongoing respiratory issues.

2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has tested positive for adrenal insufficiency. Baseline morning ACTH, cortisol, PRA, and aldosterone levels have been ordered, and cosyntropin stimulation test will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Prednisone has been started at a dose of 5 mg PO daily.

3. Anasarca/Peripheral Edema: The patient's peripheral edema has improved, and an ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix 40 mg IV bid is being continued to achieve an even/mildly negative fluid balance.

4. Anemia: The patient is likely experiencing anemia of chronic disease, as indicated by long-term hospitalization, decreased TIBC, increased ferritin, and a reticulocyte index of 1.17. Daily HCT and active T"

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.  Continues
   to fail trache mask trials.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   Patient did not tolerate trache mask trial for past two days. CXR today
   current wet read states not changed from previously.
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
   -Brochcoscopy
   - EMG?
    #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs, currently still pending
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily per endocrine
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anasarca: Improved.  An ultrasound was negative for an obstructive
   clot.  BUN and Cr stable, seem to be tolerating aggressive diuresis
   --Goal today is even/mildly negative
   --Lasix 40mg IV bid
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased
   ferritin.Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile. WBC count trending down.  Has had yeast
   and pseudomonas on urine and sputum cultures, likely colonizers.
   Patient also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central
   line from OSH now pulled, no growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated, though trending down (today 7.1%). [**Month (only) 51**]
   be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.  Continues
   to fail trache mask trials.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   Patient did not tolerate trache mask trial for past two days. However,
   today patient appears to be doing well on trache mask trial up in
   chair. CXR today current wet read states not changed from previously.
   Make sure that up in chair when trache masking.
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
   -PT consult to work with patient for strength, out of bed.
   #. Anasarca: Improved.  An ultrasound was negative for an obstructive
   clot.  BUN and Cr stable, seem to be tolerating aggressive diuresis
   --Goal today is even/mildly negative  (-250 mL)
   --Lasix 40mg IV bid
    #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs, currently still pending
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily per endocrine
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased
   ferritin.Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile. WBC count trending down.  Has had yeast
   and pseudomonas on urine and sputum cultures, likely colonizers.
   Patient also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central
   line from OSH now pulled, no growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated, though trending down (today 7.1%). [**Month (only) 51**]
   be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   - Check CBC with diff tomorrow
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.
   -Check albumin

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple complications. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, peripheral edema, pleural effusion, chronic anemia, rash, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) without acute exacerbation, seizure without status epilepticus, hypernatremia, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, and inability to protect airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and previous failure to wean from the ventilator. He requires ongoing respiratory support and there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency and is receiving corticosteroid replacement therapy. Insufficient hormone replacement can lead to adrenal crisis, which is a life-threatening condition.
3. Peripheral Edema: The patient has anasarca (generalized edema) which can be associated with various underlying conditions such as heart failure or liver cirrhosis. This can lead to complications like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism.
4. Pleural Effusion: The patient has chronic pleural effusion, which can lead to respiratory compromise and potential infection.
5. Chronic Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, likely due to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), s/p tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and multiple complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and failure to wean from the ventilator. The patient is currently in the ICU for further evaluation and management.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and required a tracheostomy due to failure to wean from the ventilator. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with 30% FiO2. There are no recent changes in the chest X-ray.
2. Anasarca: The patient has improved edema, and an ultrasound ruled out an obstructive clot. His BUN and creatinine levels are stable, indicating tolerance to aggressive diuresis. The goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of -250 mL per day.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has a positive corticotropin stimulation test for adrenal insufficiency. Baseline labs are pending, and he is on Prednisone 5mg PO daily. An outpatient appointment with an endocrinologist is scheduled.
4. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia of chronic disease, with iron studies consistent with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin."

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.  Continues
   to fail trache mask trials.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   Patient did not tolerate trache mask trial for past two days. However,
   today patient appears to be doing well on trache mask trial up in
   chair. CXR today current wet read states not changed from previously.
   Make sure that up in chair when trache masking.
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
   -PT consult to work with patient for strength, out of bed.
   #. Anasarca: Improved.  An ultrasound was negative for an obstructive
   clot.  BUN and Cr stable, seem to be tolerating aggressive diuresis
   --Goal today is even/mildly negative  (-250 mL)
   --Lasix 40mg IV bid
    #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs, currently still pending
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily per endocrine
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased
   ferritin.Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile. WBC count stable.  Has had yeast and
   pseudomonas on urine and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient
   also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line
   from OSH now pulled, no growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated, though trending down (14
 7.1%). [**Month (only) 51**] be
   secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   - Check CBC with diff tomorrow
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history of COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple complications. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, peripheral edema, chronic pleural effusion, chronic anemia, rash, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), seizure without status epilepticus, hypernatremia, electrolyte & fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, and airway protection issues.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and has undergone tracheostomy for failure to wean from the ventilator. The patient appears to be doing well on tracheostomy trial up in a chair. The current CXR shows no change.
   - Continue weaning from the ventilator, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
   - Physical therapy consult for strength training and out-of-bed activities.

2. Anasarca: The patient's edema has improved, and an ultrasound was negative for an obstructive clot. The patient is tolerating aggressive diuresis.
   - Goal today is even/mildly negative (-250 mL) fluid balance.
   - Lasix 40mg IV bid.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The corticotropin stimulation test is positive for adrenal insufficiency. Baseline morning ACTH, cortisol, PRA,"

   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.  Continues
   to fail trache mask trials.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   Patient did well on trache mask trial up in chair yesterday, removed
   trache yesterday evening and [**Doctor Last Name 7198**] this well without drop in
   oxygenation per nursing. Make sure that up in chair when trache
   masking.
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.

   60 mins. Will f/u these labs, currently still pending
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily per endocrine
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased
   ferritin.Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on

   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant medical history of COPD, who has been admitted to the ICU for multiple complications including respiratory failure, inability to wean from the ventilator, tracheostomy placement, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and has undergone tracheostomy for failure to wean from the ventilator. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with 30% FiO2 and is expected to continue weaning.

2. Anasarca: The patient's edema has improved, and an ultrasound ruled out an obstructive clot. His BUN and creatinine levels are stable, indicating tolerance of aggressive diuresis. The goal is to achieve even/mildly negative fluid balance (-250 mL) with Lasix 40mg IV bid.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's corticotropin stimulation test was positive for adrenal insufficiency. He is currently on Prednisone 5mg PO daily and will require an outpatient appointment with the endocrine department.

4. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia of chronic disease, with iron studies consistent with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin. A daily HCT and minimizing unnecessary lab draws are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple complications. He has a long hospital course, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), failure to wean from the ventilator, and tracheostomy placement. The patient was sent from another hospital for possible stenting of tracheobronchomalacia. He continues to fail tracheal mask trials.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and previous respiratory failure. He required tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation but continues to struggle with weaning from the ventilator. There is concern about his ability to protect his own airway.
2. Anasarca: The patient has peripheral edema, and there is concern about fluid overload. An ultrasound ruled out an obstructive clot, and the goal is to achieve even or mildly negative fluid balance.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's corticotropin synthesis test was positive for adrenal insufficiency. He is currently on Prednisone 5mg PO daily and will need further follow-up with an endocrinologist.
4. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia of chronic disease, with iron studies consistent with decreased TIBC and increased ferritin. Retic index indicates hypoproliferation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 80-year-old male with a significant past medical history including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple hospitalizations, tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and various complications. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, peripheral edema, chronic pleural effusion, chronic anemia, rash, and other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and previous failure to wean from the ventilator. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has shown signs of adrenal insufficiency, and ongoing management is necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, possibly due to over-diuresis. It is important to monitor and manage fluid balance carefully.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia likely due to anemia of chronic disease. Iron studies indicate decreased TIBC and increased ferritin levels.
5. Tachycardia: The patient has elevated troponins, suggesting possible myocardial ischemia. Cardiac management should be continued, and further evaluation may be required.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, but cultures have not shown any growth. Monitoring for signs of infection is essential.

   80M with PMHx significant for COPD, s/p long hospital course at OSH
   with multiple complications, including VAP, failure to wean from
   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.  Continues
   to fail trache mask trials.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   Patient did well on trache mask trial up in chair yesterday, removed
   trache yesterday evening and [**Doctor Last Name 7198**] this well without drop in
   oxygenation per nursing. Make sure that up in chair when trache
   masking.
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
   -PT consult to work with patient for strength, out of bed.
   #Hypotension: Has been having episodes of hypotension.
   - 500 ml NS bolus
   - If not
    #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs, currently still pending
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily per endocrine
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased
   ferritin.Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile. WBC count stable.  Has had yeast and
   pseudomonas on urine and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient
   also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line
   from OSH now pulled, no growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   - Check CBC with diff tomorrow
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on
   arrival to [**Hospital1 19**].   Wound care is following and he is being frequently
   repositioned.
   -Check albumin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who has been hospitalized for a long period of time and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and failure to wean from the ventilator suggests a risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and continued weaning from the ventilator are necessary.

2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's elevated cortisol level and positive response to cortisone suggest adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation and management with corticosteroids are recommended.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension. Fluid resuscitation with normal saline bolus and careful monitoring are advised.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease, as indicated by iron studies and reticulocyte index. Monitoring hemoglobin levels and considering transfusion if necessary would be appropriate.

5. Tachycardia: Elevated troponins and no evidence of coronary artery disease suggest possible demand ischemia. Medical management, including beta-blockers, should be continued.

6. Leukocytosis: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. Monitoring fever curve and considering appropriate antibiotic therapy if needed.

7. Eosinophilia: Elevated eosinophil count may be secondary to medications or other"

   ventilator, s/p trach and PEG placement, sent from OSH for IP
   assessment for possible stenting of ?tracheobronchomalacia.  Continues
   to fail trache mask trials.
    #. Respiratory Failure: H/o COPD and s/p trach for failure to wean
   from ventilator also with bronchiectasis.  CT here showed only findings
   suggestive of infection and no TBM.  Per family report, patient using
   home O2 for less than one month prior to going to hospital, seems he
   was not that limited by COPD prior to most recent hospitalization.
   Patient did well on trache mask trial up in chair yesterday, removed
   trache yesterday evening and [**Doctor Last Name 7198**] this well without drop in
   oxygenation per nursing. Make sure that up in chair when trache
   masking.
   -Will continue to wean from vent, currently on PSV 5/5 with 30% FiO2.
   -PT consult to work with patient for strength, out of bed.
   #Hypotension: Has been having episodes of hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   over-diuresed.
   - 500 ml NS bolus
   - If not responding to bolus will increase Prednisone 10 mg PO daily as
   it may be secondary to adrenal insufficiency
    #Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisotropin syn test + for adrenal
   insufficiency. Per Endocrine recs, got baseline morning ACTH, cortisol,
   PRA, [**Male First Name (un) **], then give 250mcg Cosyntropin, then the same labs at 30 and
   60 mins. Will f/u these labs, currently still pending
   - Continues on Prednisone 5mg PO daily per endocrine
   -Will need outpatient appointment for F/u with Endocrine, outpatient
   pulmonologist aware, will include in d/c summary as well.
   #. Anemia: Likely anemia of chronic disease given long hospital course;
   iron studies consistent, with decreased TIBC and increased
   ferritin.Retic index 1.17 indicating hypoproliferation.
   -Daily HCT, minimize unecassary lab draws
   -Active T&S.
   # Tachycardic: Elevated troponins, no CP; cardiology saw him on
   arrival, felt he did not require emergent cardiac catheterization,
   recommend medical management. Possible demand ischemia, in setting of
   tachycardia and hypotension.   Troponin is persistently elevated up to
   0.61.  Metoprolol was increased out of concern for likely demand
   ischemia.  Could have poor renal function without elevated creatinine
   in the setting of very little muscle mass.
   -Continue ASA
   -Continue Metoprolol 25mg PO q6
   #. Leukocytosis: Now afebrile. WBC count stable.  Has had yeast and
   pseudomonas on urine and sputum cultures, likely colonizers. Patient
   also has significant history of diarrhea, C. diff neg.  Central line
   from OSH now pulled, no growth to date.
   - No antibiotics for now.
   -Monitor fever curve
   #. Eosinophilia: Thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency; however,
   still continues to be elevated. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to medications.
   -Minimize unecassary medications
   -Prednisone as above for adrenal insufficiency
   - Check CBC with diff tomorrow
   #. Right eye injection/macular orbital rash: Seen by ophtho who said
   that this is likely blepharitis and that the pilocarpine may have been
   worsening his discomfort.  They changed his drops to bacitracin and
   vigamox which seems to be helping.
   #Ulcers: Patient has stage III decubitus ulcer on sacrum/coccyx with
   minimal amount of serous drainage, and Stage IV ulcer on left ear helix
   with very scant amount of serous drainage. Patient also has circular
   healed pressure ulcer to right post acromium process. All present on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a significant past medical history including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and other complications. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, and continues to be on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and has required tracheostomy due to failure to wean from the ventilator. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient is suspected to have adrenal insufficiency, as indicated by a positive corticotropin stimulation test. He is currently on prednisone treatment, but further evaluation and follow-up are required.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, possibly due to over-diuresis. A bolus of normal saline and an increase in prednisone dosage have been initiated.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease, with iron studies showing decreased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and increased ferritin. Monitoring of hemoglobin and minimizing unnecessary lab draws are recommended.
5. Tachycardia: The patient has elevated troponin levels without chest pain, suggesting possible demand ischemia. He is being managed medically, and metoprolol has been increased.
