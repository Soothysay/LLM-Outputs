","The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for pneumonia, presenting unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers and respiratory distress. The patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia and WBC count. Likely source of infection is aspiration. Bronchoscopy with thick secretions in the left lower lobe. The patient also has a dirty urinalysis, indicating multiple potential sources of infection.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been intubated. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia. Chest tube placement was performed due to tension pneumothorax, which has been resolved. The patient is also being treated for hypernatremia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and dementia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's presentation of fevers, respiratory distress, and elevated WBC count suggests an ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has hypernatremia, which is a high concentration of sodium in the blood. This can lead to dehydration and imbalances in fluid and electrolyte levels, potentially causing organ dysfunction.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's dirty urinalysis suggests a possible UTI, which if left untreated, can lead to complications such as"

- Dementia: Continue memantine.
- Feeding: NPO for now, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) recommendations in the morning, replete electrolytes as needed.
- Access: Right internal jugular (RIJ), peripheral intravenous (PIV), left arterial line (AL).
- Prophylaxis: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - boots, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (UF Heparin); stress ulcer - H2 blocker; ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - head of bed (HOB) elevation, mouth care, daily wake up.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. Without appropriate management, it can progress to septic shock and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to high airway pressures.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected carefully to avoid rapid shifts in serum osmolality and potential neurological complications.
4. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia, and there is a risk of delirium in the ICU due to the stress of illness, medications, and other factors.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due"

   Plan:
   # Sepsis - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia and WBC count.
   Likely source is aspiration.  Bronchoscopy with thick secretions in
   LLL.  Also patient with dirty U/A, so several sources possible.
   - Central venous line
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - IV fluid boluses and Neosynephrine  if needed to maintain MAP > 65
   and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - d/c flagyl
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics for aspiration - Vanc/Zosyn
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum/bronch cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Initial hypoxia on presentation to ICU was due
   to Tension Pneumo which was corrected with chest tube.  Aspiration
   pneumonia also likely contributing.
   - Abx as above
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated
   - Chest tube to waterseal 10cm
   - f/u thoracics recs for chest tube management
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Came in at 163, possibly due to poor PO intake at
   nursing home.
   - bolus with NS for any hypotension

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for pneumonia. She presents unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers and respiratory distress. She is intubated, alert, and has decreased breath sounds on the left lower field. She has a chest tube placed due to tension pneumothorax, and her pressures have stabilized. She requires some pressors. The patient has been started on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and bronchoscopy with thick secretions in the left lower lobe. She also has a dirty urinalysis, indicating possible sources of infection such as central venous line, IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12, transfusion for Hct > 30, IV fluid boluses and neosynephrine if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr, discontinuation of flagyl, broad-spectrum antibiotics for aspiration - Vanc/Zosyn, and follow-up blood, urine, and sputum/bronch cultures. The patient's WBC count is elevated, and she meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia and WBC count. The likely source of infection is aspiration. She also has hypernatremia, paroxysmal A-fib, dementia, and goals of care to be discussed with the HCP today. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female who presented to the emergency department in respiratory distress. She was found to have a pneumothorax on the right side and was transferred to the ICU. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has a chest tube placed. She also has an arterial line and is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Septic Shock: The patient is suspected to have septic shock, as indicated by her low blood pressure, tachycardia, and high heart rate. She has received a significant amount of fluids but still has a low urine output. The extremities are slightly cool, which could indicate poor peripheral perfusion.
2) Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure, as evidenced by her dependence on mechanical ventilation. Weaning off FiO2 may be possible but not extubation at this time.
3) Pneumothorax: The patient had a pneumothorax that required chest tube placement. This complication should be monitored closely for re-expansion of the lung.
4) Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely secondary to dehydration. Monitoring and correcting electrolyte imbalances are necessary.
5) Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had atrial fibrillation but has now returned to sinus rhythm. Monitoring for any recurrence or complications related to arrhythmias is essential.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for pneumonia, presenting unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers and respiratory distress. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient also has an inability to protect her airway, which puts her at risk for aspiration.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had hypoxia due to tension pneumothorax, which was corrected with chest tube placement. Aspiration pneumonia is also contributing to her respiratory failure.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, possibly due to poor oral intake at the nursing home. This needs to be corrected carefully to avoid rapid shifts in fluid balance.

3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which needs to be managed with appropriate medication.

4. Dementia: The patient has chronic dementia and limited decision-making capacity. Goals of care need to be discussed with the healthcare proxy.

5. Inability to Protect Airway: The patient's risk for aspiration needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.

6. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which need to be corrected with appropriate interventions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a mechanically ventilated individual in the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), and risk for aspiration due to inability to protect the airway.

The patient's vital signs show a stable oxygenation level of 99% on FiO2 40%. Heart rate is within normal limits at 65 bpm. Blood pressure is slightly low but within acceptable range for an ICU patient at 99/59 mmHg. Respiratory rate is within expected range for mechanical ventilation at 24 inspiratory minutes.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 7,370 mL and output of 1,008 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 6,362 mL. This indicates the patient has received more fluids than they have excreted.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 20.3 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 27.6%, and slightly elevated platelet count (Plt) at 180 K/uL. Blood glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's electrolytes are slightly imbalanced with a high potassium level (K+) of 5.6 mEq/L and a low sodium level (Na+) of 120 mEq/L. The renal function tests show a normal blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 14 mg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for pneumonia, presenting unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers and respiratory distress. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, aspiration, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte & fluid disorder, and urinary tract infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a chest tube in place for a tension pneumothorax. She also has hypernatremia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial hypoxia on presentation was due to tension pneumothorax, which has been corrected with chest tube placement. Aspiration pneumonia is also contributing to her respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial. The patient may require weaning off the ventilator once her respiratory status improves.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia and elevated WBC count. The likely source of sepsis is aspiration. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and response to antibiotics is essential. Source control measures such as bronchoscopy to remove secretions in the left lower lobe may be required.

3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected carefully to prevent rapid shifts in serum osmolality. Close monitoring of sodium levels and careful management of fluid and electrolyte balance is necessary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-inch-old individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia. They have been experiencing hypernatremia, which was resolved by giving D5W at 150cc/hr. The patient received a 500cc NS bolus for low blood pressure and was weaned off pressors. A chest tube has been left in place for now as long as the patient is on ventilation. The patient's arterial line stopped at 12:50 AM, and their last dose of antibiotics was metronidazole on 2106-1-5 at 05:45 AM, vancomycin on 2106-1-5 at 07:56 PM, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 2106-1-6 at 04:53 AM.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs. This condition can cause symptoms such as cough, fever, difficulty breathing, and chest pain. If left untreated, it can lead to complications like respiratory failure, sepsis, and even death.

2. Aspiration: Due to the inability to protect the airway, the patient is at risk for aspiration. Aspiration occurs when foreign material, such as food or gastric contents, enters the lungs instead of the esophagus. This can result in lung infections, such as pneumonia, and can"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for pneumonia. She presents unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers and respiratory distress after intubation. The patient has subcutaneous emphysema today, which is a concern for pneumothorax or chest tube movement. The plan includes obtaining a stat chest X-ray to evaluate the need for another chest tube and monitoring the patient. The patient no longer meets the criteria for sepsis and is off pressors. The likely source is/was aspiration, and the patient will continue with think secretions with suctioning. The central venous line will be discussed, and the antibiotic regimen will be continued for healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia in the setting of MRSA. Follow-up blood, urine, and sputum/bronchial cultures are recommended. The patient's respiratory failure is due to tension pneumothorax, which was corrected with a chest tube, as well as aspiration pneumonia. The RSBI does not suggest successful extubation at this time. The patient's thrombocytopenia is trending down but still at an acceptable level. The hypernatremia has resolved, and the patient should be monitored with fluids as needed. The patient's paroxysmal A-fib has converted back to sinus rhythm, and she is not anticoagulated. The patient's dementia is chronic, and she should continue with memantine. The patient is N"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with hypotension and sepsis. Overnight, the patient's blood pressure and perfusion parameters improved after being taken off vasopressors. The patient has a history of pneumonia, aspiration, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and urinary tract infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient presents with significant subcutaneous emphysema on examination, indicating a possible pneumothorax. Immediate insertion of a chest tube to suction and a STAT portable chest x-ray should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and manage the condition.

2. Septic Shock/Pneumonia: Although the patient is now off vasopressors and their white blood cell count has normalized, other perfusion parameters such as urine output and lactic acid levels still need to be monitored closely. The focus should be on diuresis and weaning from the ventilator, along with continuing antibiotics to address the septic shock and pneumonia.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia/septic shock and volume overload from resuscitation. Diuresis should be initiated once the blood pressure stabilizes, assuming the issue with pneumothorax is properly resolved. Changing to pressure support ventilation may also be beneficial.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating thrombocytopenia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly individual with severe kyphosis, subcutaneous emphysema on both shoulders, chest, upper abdomen, and right arm. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit, stable heart rate, low blood pressure ranging from 49 to 71 mmHg systolic and 27 to 44 mmHg diastolic, normal respiratory rate, and slightly decreased oxygen saturation at 98%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure of 14 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation. The total fluid input and output balance shows an overall positive balance of 437 mL, with significant urine output of 1,115 mL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including heparin for thromboprophylaxis, lorazepam for sedation, haloperidol for agitation, furosemide for diuresis, and various antibiotics. The arterial line was started due to the patient's low blood pressure, which responded well to a 250 cc bolus.

The respiratory support shows the patient is on assisted control mode ventilation with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for pneumonia. She presents unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers and respiratory distress after intubation. She has new subcutaneous emphysema today. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and her respiratory status is improving but still with secretions. She has aspiration pneumonia and is being treated with Vanc/Zosyn for healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia in the setting of a history of MRSA. Blood, urine, and sputum/bronchial cultures are pending, and the WBC count fever curve is being trended.

The patient also has respiratory failure with tension pneumothorax, which has been managed with chest tube placement. The chest tube is on suction with minimal drainage. The patient tolerates CPAP with pressure support throughout the day and assisted ventilation overnight for rest. The RSBI does not suggest that the patient would tolerate extubation today. There is a large contribution of pneumonia and fluid overload. Antibiotics have been started as above, and diuresis with lasix is being attempted. A lasix drip is considered, and the central venous line will be maintained until extubation. Follow-up thoracics recommendations for chest tube management are being provided, and the patient will remain on suction for now. The RSBI will be rechecked this afternoon after diuresis for potential extubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old female with recent ICU admission for likely aspiration pneumonia.
- She presented unresponsive with fevers, respiratory distress, and tension pneumothorax.
- Intubation was performed and subcutaneous emphysema developed.
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP and PS throughout the day, and AC overnight.
- Chest tube placement was done due to tension pneumothorax.
- The patient has an increased white blood cell count, indicating infection.
- Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered.
- The patient's respiratory system is compromised, and she is at risk for aspiration.
- Electrolyte and fluid disorders are present.
- She has a history of dementia and is receiving tube feeds through an orogastric tube.
- Thrombocytopenia is also noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and findings suggest aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and fever indicate an ongoing infection, which could progress to sepsis if not managed appropriately.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, and she may require prolonged mechanical ventilation support.
4. Tension Pneumothorax: The patient had a tension pneumothorax, which required chest tube placement. Close monitoring is needed"

- The patient is more alert in the morning.
- The family discussed not intubating the patient, but the patient remains full code.
- The patient has a history of allergies, antibiotic dosages, and current infusions.
- The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress.
- The patient has subcutaneous emphysema on the right chest/arm/neck, a systolic murmur, and clear breath sounds.
- The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis, an elevated CRP, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient has imaging showing an endotracheal tube and a right-sided chest tube in place.
- The patient's assessment and plan include pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte/fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), and airway inability to protect.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that was treated with chest tube placement and intubation. She developed subcutaneous emphysema on [**1-6**].

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure with tension pneumothorax, aspiration pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She also has an inability to protect her airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, cough).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
- Heart rate: 72 bpm (67-78)
- Blood pressure: 93/34 mmHg (56/24-130/48)
- Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (11-30)
- Oxygen saturation: 98%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's lab results show:
- White blood cell count: 10.1-10.2 thousand/mm³
- Hemoglobin: 7.9-7.9 g/dL
- Sodium: 154-154 mEq/L
- Potassium: 3.0-3.0 mEq/L
- Creatinine: 0.3-0.6 mg/dL
- Glucose: 113-141 mg/dL

The patient's chest tube dressing was changed, and she continues to tolerate CPAP with pressure support throughout the day and assisted ventilation at night. The chest tube is on suction with minimal drainage. The patient's RSBI does not suggest she would tolerate extubation today. There is no air leak today.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening respiratory failure, progression of aspiration pneumonia, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further electrolyte and fluid disorders. Additionally, the patient's thrombocytopenia should be monitored, and there is a risk for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement and intubation. The patient has developed subcutaneous emphysema. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP and PS mode, with minimal drainage from the chest tube. The RSBI does not suggest that the patient would tolerate extubation today. There are concerns for potential medical complications such as aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia indicates a possible ongoing infection in the lungs due to inhalation of food, liquids, or stomach contents. This can lead to respiratory distress and may require further treatment with antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating severe respiratory failure. This can be a result of aspiration pneumonia and tension pneumothorax. The RSBI does not suggest that the patient would tolerate extubation today, indicating ongoing respiratory support may be needed.
3. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The presence of fever and respiratory distress suggests systemic inflammation, which could progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is crucial.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure likely due to aspiration pneumonia, with ongoing secretions and an inability to protect their airway.
- The patient also has septic shock/pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics.
- There is subcutaneous emphysema due to a bronopleural fistula following line placement.
- Thrombocytopenia has improved.
- The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder needs to be addressed.
- There is a risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance.
- The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect their airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The ongoing infection and inflammation in the body may progress to sepsis, potentially leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Bronchopleural fistula: The presence of a fistula can result in persistent air leaks and complications such as pneumothorax or empyema.
4. Thrombocytopenia: Although the patient's platelet count has improved, it is still important to monitor for any signs of bleeding or clotting disorders.
5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's imbalances in potassium, sodium, chloride, and other electrolytes need to be corrected to maintain proper bodily functions.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are currently experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and a bronchopleural fistula. They also have sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorders, and a urinary tract infection. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has a chest tube in place. Their vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 132/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. However, the patient is at risk for aspiration due to an altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may continue to deteriorate if the aspiration pneumonia and bronchopleural fistula are not adequately managed.
2. Septic shock/pneumonia: There is a risk of worsening sepsis and septic shock if the underlying infection is not properly treated.
3. Subcutaneous emphysema: The presence of subcutaneous emphysema indicates a possible complication from the bronchopleural fistula, which could lead to further respiratory complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a risk of bleeding complications.
5. Electrolyte and fluid imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels and fluid status are abnormal, which can affect various organ functions and overall health.
6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is at risk of developing or experiencing worsening UTI due to catheterization.
7. Airway protection: The patient's inability to protect their own airway increases the risk of further aspiration events."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax. The patient was intubated and had a chest tube placement with development of subcutaneous emphysema. She has been improving overall but still has secretions. She is currently on Vanc/Zosyn for healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia in the setting of MRSA. Blood, urine, and sputum/bronchial cultures are being followed, and her WBC count fever curve is trending. A long-term plan of care and aspiration precautions will be discussed with the family in the setting of likely chronic aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for continued respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and fluid overload. RSBI does not suggest that she would tolerate extubation today.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is not in shock. It is important to monitor her blood pressure and respond appropriately with fluids or medications as needed.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, including low potassium, low magnesium, and high bicarbonate levels. Close monitoring and management of these imbalances are necessary.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient may be at risk for developing a UTI due"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax. The patient underwent intubation and chest tube placement, resulting in subcutaneous emphysema.

The patient's condition has shown improvement overall, although she still has secretions. She is currently on Vanc/Zosyn for healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia in the setting of MRSA. Blood, urine, and sputum/bronchial cultures are being followed, and the WBC count fever curve is being trended. The long-term plan of care and aspiration precautions are being discussed with the family.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure with tension pneumothorax, which was managed by chest tube placement. The chest tube is now at water seal, and the patient tolerates CPAP with pressure support throughout the day and assisted ventilation overnight. RSBI is deferred due to the patient's tachypnea. Large contributions from pneumonia and fluid overload are suspected. No air leak is observed today, and a chest X-ray will be performed this afternoon.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement and intubation. The patient also developed subcutaneous emphysema.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of chronic aspiration, which increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory distress and require mechanical ventilation.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia and fluid overload. This can result in hypoxemia and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

3. Tension Pneumothorax: The patient had a tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement. If not managed properly, it can lead to respiratory distress and compromised cardiac output.

4. Subcutaneous Emphysema: The patient developed subcutaneous emphysema, which is an abnormal collection of air in the subcutaneous tissue. It can occur due to trauma or procedures such as chest tube placement. Monitoring for any signs of worsening or infection is essential.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially if invasive procedures are required"

   Patient very tachypneic on the ventilator, although she denies dyspnea.
   Oxygenation adequate. Tidal volumes are small (150-250) when PSV
   reduced. Still significant airway secretions. When these diminish, will
   make attempt at extubation. Continue present antibiotics.
   Hct stable. Not at transfusion threshold now.
   No fluctuations in water seal chamber with respiration. Height of water
   seal chamber 8 cm. Ask thoracic surgery to reassess tube; not clear it
   is in communication with pleural space absent respiratory variation
   (may have clot). Would like to see less water in water seal chamber.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions. They have aspiration pneumonia and tension pneumothorax, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), anemia, and pneumothorax. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 109/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and is on multiple medications including antibiotics, insulin, furosemide, midazolam, famotidine, heparin sodium, colace, amiodarone, vit D, chlorhexidine, fentanyl, senna, and versed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of prolonged ventilation if the patient does not improve.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of the bed, performing regular mouth care, and assessing respiratory system infection risk score (RSBI) will be implemented to prevent VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement and intubation. The patient has shown improvement in her condition but still faces several medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and tension pneumothorax. This condition requires close monitoring and ongoing management, including the use of mechanical ventilation and chest tube drainage.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be related to sepsis, fluid overload, or other underlying causes. Monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation or medication adjustment may be necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.

3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of infection from aspiration pneumonia and other sources. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is essential for early detection and prompt treatment.

4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels and fluid balance need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent any imbalances that could complicate her recovery.

5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Although not currently active, the patient's history and clinical presentation suggest a risk for UTI. Regular urine cultures and appropriate antibiotic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement and intubation. The patient has developed subcutaneous emphysema. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 99%. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/49 to 159/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and temperature of 36.6°C.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and tension pneumothorax. She requires mechanical ventilation to support her breathing. The ongoing concern is the potential for worsening respiratory failure and the need for continued ventilatory support.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which increases the risk of secondary infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Monitoring for signs of worsening lung infection, such as increased fever, increased sputum production, or changes in oxygenation, is crucial.

3. Sepsis: Given the presence of pneumonia and potential secondary infections, the patient is at risk for developing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient remains tachypnic with low tidal volumes, and extubation has been deferred. A chest tube has been placed without inspiratory/expiratory variation, but no recommendations have been made to fix this issue. The patient has diuresed 400 cc and has a decreasing hematocrit level, which indicates acute blood loss. Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease. The patient also has a mushroom catheter with brown stool, but cannot perform a guaiac test. The family has been updated with no new decisions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to sepsis or fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection (sepsis) with elevated white blood cell count and positive blood cultures. This increases the risk of organ dysfunction and potentially death.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which may be a result of aspiration due to the inability to protect their own airway.
5. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, including low potassium, magnesium, and sodium levels. These imbalances need"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that was treated with chest tube placement and intubation. The patient developed subcutaneous emphysema on [1-6]. 

The patient has several medical complications including:
1. Hypotension (not in shock)
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
3. Pneumonia, aspiration
4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction
5. Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other
6. Urinary tract infection (UTI)
7. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough)

The patient is currently on various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, furosemide, famotidine, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 95/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and platelet count within normal range. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits except for slightly low magnesium. Other lab results"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax (ptx) that required chest tube placement and intubation. The patient developed subcutaneous emphysema on [**1-6**].

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information in the note include:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of chronic aspiration, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia in the setting of a history of MRSA.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to tension ptx, which has been managed with chest tube placement and CPAP with PSV. The patient's RSBI is 179, indicating large contributions from pneumonia and fluid overload. The plan is to remove the chest tube once the patient is extubated and to continue diuresis with Lasix for a goal of -1L today.

3. Subcutaneous Emphysema: The patient has stable to improved subcutaneous emphysema after a dressing change yesterday. Daily CXR will be monitored, and thoracics will follow chest tube management.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has improved from prior levels and is stable over the past"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax (ptx) that required chest tube placement and intubation. The patient also developed subcutaneous emphysema. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's conditions include:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of chronic aspiration, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. It is important to continue the current antibiotics and discuss long-term plan of care/aspiration precautions with the family.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to the tension ptx, which has been managed with chest tube placement and CPAP/PSV ventilation. There is a concern for large contribution of pneumonia and fluid overload. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and continue with appropriate interventions.

3. Subcutaneous Emphysema: The patient developed subcutaneous emphysema, which may indicate an ongoing leak from the tension ptx. Close monitoring and daily chest X-ray are recommended to assess the resolution of subcutaneous emphysema.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has improved from prior values but is still within the low range. Monitoring of the platelet count is advised to ensure timely intervention"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for several conditions including hypotension, respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection, and inability to protect the airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is monitored closely due to acute respiratory failure. If not properly managed, this condition may progress to more severe respiratory distress or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. If not promptly treated, sepsis can lead to organ failure and potentially death.
3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels and fluid balance are abnormal. If left uncorrected, this can result in various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, kidney dysfunction, and other organ dysfunctions.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Although the patient has been diagnosed with a UTI, it is essential to monitor for any worsening symptoms or signs of infection, as it may progress to a more serious condition if not appropriately managed.
5. Inability to protect the airway: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to an altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance. This increases"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation support and has had several interventions including the placement of a chest tube. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/41 mmHg to 95/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's condition is being closely monitored for potential complications such as hypotension, respiratory failure, sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, urinary tract infection, and airway protection issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to sepsis or fluid imbalances. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation or vasopressor therapy may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is essential. Adjustments to ventilator settings and oxygen delivery may be necessary to maintain adequate gas exchange.

3. Sepsis: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement and intubation. The patient has shown overall improvement but still has secretions. She is being treated with antibiotics for healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia in the setting of a history of MRSA. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, indicating that she is no longer meeting the criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). She is tolerating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with pressure support throughout the day and assist control (AC) overnight. The patient's respiratory system is stable, but there may be a large contribution of pneumonia and fluid overload. A chest tube is still in place, and the patient is receiving diuretics with Lasix for fluid removal. The patient's platelet count has improved from prior values and is stable. She has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but has been converted back to sinus rhythm. The patient also has chronic dementia and is on medication for it. She is receiving tube feeds via orogastric (OG) tube, and her electrolytes are being replenished as needed. The patient has central venous and arterial lines in place. She is being monitored closely, and her code status is full code."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and sepsis. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 102/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on FiO2 of 40%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, famotidine, and heparin sodium. She has a history of pneumonia and sepsis, and her recent labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's fluid balance is negative by 1,611 mL since midnight, and she has received a total of 2,039 mL of fluids and lost 3,650 mL through various outputs. The patient's arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.48, PaO2 of 283 mmHg, and PaCO2 of 27 mmHg. Her neurological examination is normal, but she has a risk for aspiration due to an altered gag reflex and impaired airway protection. The patient's electrolytes are relatively stable, except for a slightly low magnesium level. The patient's recent imaging shows improvement in her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect her airway increases the risk of aspiration, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement and intubation. The patient developed subcutaneous emphysema and is now in the wet phase of diuresis.

The patient has several medical conditions, including hypotension (not in shock), respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS), pneumonia (aspiration), sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including Lasix for diuresis, Vancomycin and Zosyn for healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia, amiodarone for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and memantine for dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of chronic aspiration increases the risk of recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be exacerbated by her aspiration pneumonia and fluid overload.
3. Tension Pneumothorax: The patient's previous tension pneumothorax, although resolved, could potentially recur if there is a reaccumulation of air in the pleural space.
4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction could progress to septic shock if not managed appropriately.

The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple health issues. The patient has been receiving various medications including lasix, piperacillin/tazobactam, famotidine, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/40 to 144/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 335 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine (Cr) levels, as well as low platelet count (Plt). Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current conditions include hypotension, respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte & fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), and inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, impaired airway clearance, and cough).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female who presented to the ICU with symptoms of respiratory distress, fever, and a tension pneumothorax. She required intubation and chest tube placement, and was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for healthcare-associated aspiration pneumonia, including Vancomycin and Zosyn. Her current conditions include hypotension, respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection, and inability to protect the airway.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if she is unable to wean off the ventilator or if there is a recurrence of aspiration leading to further lung complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if the antibiotics are not effective against the causative organism or if she develops any new complications such as abscess formation or pleural effusion.
3. Sepsis: There is a risk of sepsis progression if the patient's infection control measures fail or if the infection spreads to other organs.
4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte and fluid imbalances need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or renal dysfunction.
5. Urinary Tract Infection: If left untreated, the urinary tract infection may progress and lead to more serious complications such as urosepsis or pyel"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a chief complaint of failed respiratory system assessment (RSBI) yesterday, and the ventilator settings were adjusted accordingly. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including hypotension, respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UTI), and risk for aspiration. The patient is currently receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These may include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, which increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic inflammatory response due to an infection.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications with the ventilator settings or if the underlying cause of respiratory distress is not adequately addressed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension (low blood pressure) can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, which can affect various bodily functions and potentially lead to complications.
6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI, which if left untreated or inadequately managed, can progress and cause further"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and urinary tract infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, and fluid balance shows a negative balance of 2,763 mL since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the presence of pulmonary edema.
2. Pneumothorax: The patient has a history of pneumothorax that required chest tube placement.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a risk of bleeding complications.
4. Access Issues: The patient has a PICC line in place and an internal jugular vein (IJ) line removed. There is a potential risk of complications related to these lines, such as infection or thrombosis.
5. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory failure is now likely secondary to pulmonary edema. Aggressive diuresis should be continued to manage this condition.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolytes are slightly imbalanced, which can affect various bodily functions if not corrected promptly.
7. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI, which may require appropriate antibiotic treatment.
8. Airway Protection: Due to the patient's inability to protect their own airway, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia and subsequent respiratory complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent dialysis with 4.5L removed.
- Antibiotics were administered, including Dapto/[**Last Name (un)**] until [**1-21**], and vancomycin for 2 weeks following discontinuation of the course.
- Fentanyl patch was increased to 50mcg.
- The patient had atrial fibrillation on [**1-10**], and it was written to reinstate Coumadin.
- Speech and swallow consultation was requested.
- Case management screening for placement was conducted.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on [**2106-1-12**] at 10:30 AM and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2106-1-13**] at 04:02 AM.
- The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), Furosemide (Lasix), and others.

The patient's vital signs as of [**2106-1-14**] 06:50 AM show a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/41 (58) to 153/144 (149) mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 inspirations per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance indicates a total input of 1,506 mL, including 608 mL through PO, 846 mL through TF, and 340 mL through IVF. The total output includes 3,195 mL of blood products and 1,620 mL of urine. The net fluid balance is -1,689 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube and CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 353 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results show pH 7.53, PaCO2 46 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 240.

The physical examination findings are incomplete due to lack of assessment in several areas, such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, and tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 23.5%, increased platelet count (Plt) of 368 K/uL, and normal creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab values, including glucose, electrolytes"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax. She was intubated and developed subcutaneous emphysema. The patient continues to improve, tolerating CPAP with PS throughout the day and AC overnight. A chest tube was placed to suction for recurrent pneumothorax. The patient completed an antibiotic course and diuresis was good, with a loss of 2.6 liters. She was hypotensive and received a 250cc bolus at 4am.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia and a tension pneumothorax. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or worsening respiratory distress.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has likely aspiration pneumonia. There is a risk of progression of the pneumonia or development of new infections due to her compromised respiratory status and immobility.
3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction. There is a risk of progression to septic shock if not appropriately managed.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluid. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient may be"

   1)Respiratory Failure
   - initially secondary to pneumonia and sepsis but has since improved
   and now with pulmonary edema
 however, cxr today has more dense
   opacity in right lower lobe which may be fluid, early HAP, atelectasis
   Plan:
   - Question of new infiltrate in right lower lobe which could be
   atelectasis  or potentially developing HAP although no fever or
   significant secretions at this point -> will follow closely and if any
   signs of infection or increased secretions or worsening infiltrate,
   then will re-start antibiotics
   - Continue diuresis
   - Discuss with family whether would want to pursue tracheostomy if
   unable to wean off ventilator
 in meantime, continue to work toward
   extubation
   2)Pneumothorax:
   - persistent leak and cannot discontinue chest tube at this time
keep
   on suction for now
   3) Anemia
 follow hematocrit

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia and pulmonary edema. She has been in the ICU and is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 96/46 mmHg to 129/67 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, with a respiratory system compliance of 115 L/min, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.53, PaCO2 46 mmHg, PaO2 240 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral chest crepitus, right-sided edema, warm skin, and no focal neurological findings. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9 mg/dL, and slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) level of 23.5%. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte/fluid disorder, urinary tract infection (UT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with respiratory failure. She is currently receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of pneumonia, aspiration, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and urinary tract infection. She also has an inability to protect her airway, which increases the risk of aspiration and impaired gag reflex.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which could lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to the mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia, UTI, and sepsis. There is a risk of developing new infections or worsening of existing ones, particularly due to the invasive lines and the immunocompromised state.
3. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has an electrolyte and fluid disorder, which can lead to complications like cardiac arrhythmias or renal dysfunction.
4. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, especially in vulnerable areas like the sacrum or heels.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of DVT, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if left untreated.
6. Aspiration Pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect her airway"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement and intubation. She developed subcutaneous emphysema and was successfully diuresed. Her overall respiratory and mental status have been improving.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient initially had aspiration pneumonia, which is a lung infection caused by inhaling foreign material into the lungs. Although her condition has improved, she still has secretions in her sputum, indicating ongoing respiratory issues.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced acute respiratory failure, possibly due to the aspiration pneumonia and tension pneumothorax. She required mechanical ventilation support through CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.
3. Tension Pneumothorax: The patient had a tension pneumothorax, which is a life-threatening condition where air accumulates in the pleural space and cannot escape, leading to increased pressure on the lung and potentially compromising blood flow. She underwent chest tube placement to relieve the pressure.
4. Subcutaneous Emphysema: The patient developed subcutaneous emphysema, a condition where air leaks into the subcutaneous tissue. This is often associated with pneumothorax or trauma. It has nearly resolved with conservative management.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female admitted with respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient's course has been complicated by a line-associated pneumothorax. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/49 mmHg to 128/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, famotidine, heparin sodium, amiodarone, calcium carbonate, vitamin D, and Pepcid. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated potassium and magnesium levels, and low albumin level.

The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, urinary tract infection, and inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, and airway clearance).

The plan of care includes adding a scopolamine patch to decrease oral secretions, attempting to extubate the patient today, re-checking chest X-ray post-CT clamp, and continuing ICU care. The patient is critically ill, and close monitoring and management are required."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement and intubation. The patient successfully diuresed and is now showing improvement in her overall respiratory and mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient initially had aspiration pneumonia, which has improved but still shows some signs of infection with 2+ GPCs in the sputum. Monitoring for any worsening respiratory symptoms or fever is important.
2. Respiratory Failure with tension PTX: The patient had tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement. The chest tube is currently at water seal and the patient tolerates CPAP with PS throughout the day and AC overnight. Continued monitoring of the chest tube drainage and follow-up thoracic recommendations are necessary.
3. Subcutaneous Emphysema: The patient had subcutaneous emphysema, which has nearly resolved. Daily chest X-rays and monitoring are recommended to ensure resolution.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient had thrombocytopenia, but it has improved. Monitoring platelet levels is important to ensure stability.
5. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient converted back to sinus rhythm. Continued monitoring and use of amiodarone are necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with likely aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive from her nursing home with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement and intubation. The patient developed subcutaneous emphysema and successfully underwent chest tube removal and extubation. Her overall respiratory and mental status have been improving. However, she still requires high levels of supplemental oxygen. Sputum culture revealed the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-positive. The patient is currently on vancomycin and levofloxacin for hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially considering her prior MRSA positivity. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 9.3 to 13.9 thousand/mm3. Her hemoglobin level is 7.4 g/dL, and platelet count is 86 thousand/mm3. Blood glucose levels have been within normal range. Other lab values indicate possible electrolyte imbalances and kidney dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she has a high respiratory rate and low blood pressure. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles and rhonchi in both lungs, especially on the right side, and significant pitting edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination is incomplete due to her mental status impairment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. She required intubation and mechanical ventilation, but was later extubated. The patient has been diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumoniae infection and Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-positive infection, for which she has been restarted on vancomycin and levofloxacin. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. She has been receiving various medications such as heparin sodium, famotidine, and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The presence of Staphylococcus aureus coagulase-positive infection indicates a potential bacterial cause for VAP.
2. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, especially considering the presence of infections.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's risk for aspiration is increased due to the inability to protect her airway. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium levels, indicating the need for careful monitoring and management of electrolyte balance.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 115/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's chest tube was removed on 01/16/2106 at 05:01 PM.

The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL, platelet count of 432 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride of 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 22.3%, glucose of 89 mg/dL, and albumin of 2.1 g/dL. The patient's blood cultures grew Klebsiella and Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, respiratory failure, pneumonia due to aspiration, sepsis without organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and urinary tract infection. The patient is at risk for airway obstruction due to altered gag reflex and inability to protect the airway.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. She has been recovering in the ICU and has made progress, including being extubated yesterday afternoon. A chest tube was removed on January 16th. Klebsiella and Staph were grown out of her sputum culture. She is currently on antibiotics (Vancomycin and Levofloxacin) and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/46 to 131/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. She is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and standby ventilator mode. Her ABG results indicate adequate oxygenation and ventilation. She is alert and oriented, with no signs of sedation or paralysis. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds and no signs of cyanosis or clubbing. Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and glucose levels. Imaging shows no new pulmonary edema, but limited views due to obscured head. Microbiology reports positive cultures for Klebsiella and Staphylococcus aureus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient did well after extubation, but there is a risk of reintubation if her respiratory status deteriorates.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and pneumonia. He has been extubated and is currently on a face tent with oxygen delivery. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 124/49 mmHg and a heart rate of 76 bpm. He is still intubated and requires respiratory support.

The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and sepsis without organ dysfunction. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for low magnesium and phosphorus levels. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, while his hemoglobin and platelet levels are normal. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an increased creatinine level.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics for MRSA and Klebsiella in his sputum. He also has a central line and a peripheral IV line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he does not improve with the current respiratory support. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may progress and lead to further respiratory complications. Monitoring for any changes in sputum production, oxygen saturation, and chest X-ray findings is important.

3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis could potentially deteriorate into septic shock if not appropriately managed. Continuous monitoring of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay for aspiration pneumonia. She presented unresponsive with fevers, respiratory distress, and a tension pneumothorax that required chest tube placement and intubation. The patient developed subcutaneous emphysema and was successfully diuresed. She was started on antibiotics for Klebsiella and MRSA from a sputum culture. The patient underwent extubation and chest tube removal on [**1-16**]. She is currently on supplemental oxygen and being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and ongoing respiratory distress indicate a potential complication of pneumonia. Klebsiella and Staph Aureus were found in her sputum culture, for which she is receiving antibiotic treatment.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had tension pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement and intubation. Although the chest tube has been removed, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to underlying lung damage or infection.
3. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient presented with fevers and respiratory distress, which could indicate an infection leading to sepsis. She is receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment, but close monitoring is necessary.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has imbalances in her electrolytes and fluid status, as indicated by her lab results. It is important to manage her fluid and electroly"
