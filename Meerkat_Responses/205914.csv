","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis presenting with painless lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/41-131/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no signs of distress or organomegaly. Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine and potassium levels. The patient has been started on a massive transfusion protocol due to ongoing hemorrhage. The plan includes transfusing 2 units of packed red blood cells now, with additional units available as needed, and coordinating an abdominal angiogram if necessary. Electrolyte levels will be monitored and calcium may need repletion. The patient has been placed on DNR/DNI status, with permission to intubate for procedures. Prophylactic measures include PPI and pneumatic boots. The patient requires central venous catheter access due to tenuous peripheral intravenous access."

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old individual with diverticulosis presenting with a painless lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's low blood count (Hct 23.7%) and elevated white blood cell count (WBC 8.2 K/uL) indicate a potential risk for ongoing bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and continuous assessment of the patient's hemodynamic status is crucial to identify any signs of hemorrhage.

2. Infection: The elevated WBC count may also suggest an underlying infection. Regular monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters should be done to detect any signs of infection, such as fever or an increasing trend in the WBC count.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are within normal limits, but there is a slight variation. It is important to monitor blood pressure closely and promptly address any episodes of hypotension to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

4. Respiratory issues: Although the patient's oxygen saturation is currently at 100% and the respiratory rate is within normal limits, it is essential to continue monitoring the respiratory status for any signs of deterioration. The patient's ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation should be closely monitored.

5. Fluid balance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid over the past 24 hours, with a total"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with diverticulosis who presented with a painless lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.1Â°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal range of 65-101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/55 mmHg to 177/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with a normal range of 8-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 78.4 kg.

The patient has been receiving multiple infusions and medications, including sodium bicarbonate, dextrose, furosemide (Lasix), insulin, and pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient also has several allergies and previous medical conditions, but these are not specified in the note.

Fluid balance shows an input of 4,975 mL, including 579 mL of blood products, and an output of 3,230 mL, with a negative balance of 1,745 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula and has an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of 7.37///28/. 

Physical examination reveals an alert patient with no acute distress, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender without rebound tenderness or guarding. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), as well as elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan for the patient include management of the lower GI bleed likely due to diverticulosis, with plans for tagging red blood cells (RBCs) and coordination for abdominal angiography if positive. The patient is also being monitored for calcium repletion and massive transfusion protocol monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient may experience further bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and organ dysfunction.

2. Infection: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures increase the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.

3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's vital signs indicate hypertension and tachycardia, which could be signs of inadequate perfusion and organ stress. This could potentially lead to kidney injury or failure, hepatic dysfunction, or cardiovascular complications.

4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels and abnormal laboratory values suggest potential electrolyte disturbances, such as hypernatremia, hyperkalemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 88 yo F with diverticulosis and h/o GI
   bleed who presents with a painless lower GI bleed.
   .
   # GI Bleed: most likely due to diverticulosis. GI and surgery aware,
   typed and crossed;  Hct slowly drifting down overnight, but no further
   BRBPR.  Patient drank ~2L of golytely last night before having to lie
   flat after angiosheath removal.  She had 1 bottle of magnesium citrate
   this morning, however, stools are still not yet clear.
   - HCT Q6H, increased frequency if further BRBPR
   - 2L more of golytely this morning with plan for colonoscopy this
   afternoon if clear
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   .
   # Femoral bruit: Patient felt to have small hematoma medially last
   night when sheath was removed.  Unclear if bruit is new or old as there
   is no prior documentation regarding this on this admission.
   - Femoral ultrasound this am to assess
   - IR following; their assistance appreciated
   .
   # Afib: stable, patient does have occasional [**12-9**] sec pauses on
   telemetry
   .
   # HTN: holding home antihypertensives given potential for rapid GI
   bleed until further info from colonoscopy.
   - nitro drip prn for hypertension
   .
   # FEN:  NPO except golytely, IVF, replete electrolytes, ISS
   .
   # Prophylaxis: [**Hospital1 **] PPI and pneumo boots
   .
   # Access: RIJ placed [**2130-2-8**]

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo female admitted with lower GI bleed and with clinical evidence of
   continued bleed patient has undergone multiple procedures to look for
   source of bleeding.  Angiography was performed at what appeared to be a
   possibly optimal time based on active bleeding--source, however, was
   not found.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female admitted to the ICU with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has undergone multiple procedures to identify the source of bleeding, including angiography, but the source was not found. 

The patient is currently experiencing complications related to hemorrhage, specifically an anal and rectal abscess, as well as hematoma formation due to procedures. Additionally, the patient has gastrointestinal bleeding, other than peptic ulcer disease.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has shown a good response to transfusions, indicating that the patient is receiving blood products to manage the bleeding. The current active issue is identifying and controlling the bleeding source.

The plan moving forward includes continuing with GoLytely, maintaining two peripheral intravenous (P-IV) lines, aiming to increase the patient's hemoglobin concentration every four hours today, discussing the case in the gastrointestinal consult, monitoring the femoral bruit and hematoma, performing an ultrasound (U/S) today, and following extremity exams.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on a nothing-by-mouth (npo) diet, has two peripheral lines inserted, and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI), and the patient is expected to remain in the ICU."

   # GI Bleed: most likely due to diverticulosis. GI and surgery aware,
   typed and crossed;  Hct now stable and no further BRBPR.  Patient
   stools are clear.  GI currently feels that patient does not need
   colonoscopy.  If rebleeds, may need partial colectomy.
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT

   # Femoral bruit: Stable.  Ultrasound showed no AV fistula or
   pseudoaneurysm.  Assistance from IR appreciated.
   .
   # Afib: stable, patient does have occasional [**12-9**] sec pauses on
   telemetry
   .
   # HTN: Home antihypertensives were held given potential for rapid GI
   bleed until further info from colonoscopy.  As no further bleeding and
   patient
s blood pressure has crept up, would be appropriate now to
   slowly restart anti-HTN regimen.
   .
   # FEN:  IVF, replete electrolytes, ISS titrated up given hyperglycemia;

","The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis and previous gastrointestinal bleed who presents with a painless lower gastrointestinal bleed. The most likely cause of the GI bleed is diverticulosis. The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.8 g/dL, which indicates anemia likely due to the bleed. The patient has been stabilized, and her hemoglobin levels are now stable without further bleeding. 

The patient also has a femoral bruit but no AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm was found on ultrasound. The patient's atrial fibrillation is stable, but there are occasional pauses on telemetry. The patient's blood pressure has been monitored, and it is appropriate to restart antihypertensive medication now that there is no further bleeding. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,887 mL and total output of 2,132 mL over the last 24 hours, with a positive balance of 1,755 mL. The patient's respiratory support shows an oxygen saturation of 96% and ABG results of ///27. 

The patient's physical examination reveals an alert and oriented individual without acute distress. The patient has clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and a soft, non-tender abdomen with increased bowel sounds. The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.7, hemoglobin of 37.9, platelet count of 129, creatinine of 0.8, glucose of 118, and electrolyte levels within normal range. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring, restarting antihypertensive medication, restarting enteral feeding if no colonoscopy is performed, and continuing prophylactic measures such as PPI and pneumo boots. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is pending disposition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 88 yo F with diverticulosis and h/o GI
   bleed who presents with a painless lower GI bleed.
   .
   # GI Bleed: most likely due to diverticulosis. GI and surgery aware,
   typed and crossed;  Hct slowly drifting down overnight, but no further
   BRBPR.  Patient drank ~2L of golytely last night before having to lie
   flat after angiosheath removal.  She had 1 bottle of magnesium citrate
   this morning, however, stools are still not yet clear.
   - HCT Q6H, increased frequency if further BRBPR
   - 2L more of golytely this morning with plan for colonoscopy this
   afternoon if clear
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   .
   # Femoral bruit: Patient felt to have small hematoma medially last
   night when sheath was removed.  Unclear if bruit is new or old as there
   is no prior documentation regarding this on this admission.
   - Femoral ultrasound this am to assess

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of diverticulosis and previous gastrointestinal (GI) bleed who presents with a painless lower GI bleed. The assessment suggests that the GI bleed is most likely due to diverticulosis. 

The patient has been managed with various interventions including Hct Q6H to monitor and increase frequency if further bleeding occurs, 2L more of golytely for bowel preparation for colonoscopy, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastric acid suppression. 

Additionally, the patient was found to have a femoral bruit, which could indicate a hematoma or vascular issue. An ultrasound of the femoral area was performed, and interventional radiology (IR) is following up on this matter. 

The patient also has atrial fibrillation (Afib) with occasional pauses, hypertension, and is being monitored closely for any complications. 

The patient is currently nil per os (NPO) except for golytely for bowel preparation, intravenous fluids (IVF), repletion of electrolytes, and insulin sliding scale (ISS). Prophylactic measures include PPI and pneumo boots. The patient has a right internal jugular (RIJ) line placed and a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status with permission to intubate for procedures."
