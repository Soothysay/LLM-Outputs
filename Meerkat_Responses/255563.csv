","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids and nasogastric tube drainage. The family meeting held this morning discussed the patient's prognosis and code status, with a decision made to maintain DNR/DNI. The patient has been started on antibiotics empirically for possible pneumonia. The arterial line was inserted, and various lab tests have been conducted. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 95-108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/82 to 132/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's abdominal examination reveals a soft and distended abdomen with tenderness upon deep palpation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis given the distended abdomen limiting diaphragmatic excursion. Monitoring oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be essential to assess the patient's progress.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's large volume"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient has been in the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She is also experiencing oliguria, which is likely due to volume depletion. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and is receiving antibiotics empirically for suspected pneumonia. Her pain is being managed with fentanyl, and she is NPO (nothing by mouth) due to the SBO. The patient's code status is full code, and a family meeting was held to discuss prognosis and code status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis due to her distended abdomen limiting diaphragmatic excursion. Continued monitoring and weaning off mechanical ventilation as tolerated will be important.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient presented with SBO, and there has been a large volume output from the nasogastric tube without bowel movements yet. Surgery has been declined by the family. The management plan includes continued nasogastric tube placement, aggressive fluid replacement, and electrolyte repletion as needed.

3. Oliguria: The patient has poor urine output since admission, which is likely due to volume depletion. Fluid boluses will be continued as needed to achieve a target urine output"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presented with small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient's condition has been unstable, with dry labs leading to the administration of intravenous fluids (IVF) throughout the day and night. A significant amount of feculent material was drained from the nasogastric tube (NGT), and no bowel movements have been observed yet. A family meeting was held to discuss prognosis and code status, and it was decided to maintain current care without surgery.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. The most recent blood gas shows adequate oxygenation and ventilation, but the patient's pulmonary reserve is limited due to lung metastases and home oxygen use. There is a suspicion of respiratory decompensation in the emergency department (ED) due to a distended abdomen limiting diaphragmatic excursion and possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has SBO, including intussusception and adhesions. A large volume output from the NGT yesterday without any bowel movements yet suggests ongoing obstruction. Surgery is recommended based on the surgeon's recommendations. Aggressive fluid replacement and repletion of electrolytes are being continued.

3. Oliguria: The patient has poor urine output since admission to the ICU, likely due to volume depletion. There is no evidence of hydrone"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) admitted to the ICU for small bowel obstruction (SBO) and respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and has shown some improvement in urine output. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The blood gases show adequate oxygenation and ventilation, but the high RSBI suggests a risk for extubation failure. Close monitoring and weaning of ventilation support will be necessary.

2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient has a known history of SBO, which is likely contributing to her poor oral intake and subsequent malnutrition. NG tube output turned bloody, indicating possible bowel ischemia or perforation. Aggressive fluid replacement and close monitoring are essential to prevent further complications.

3. Oliguria: The patient has poor urine output since admission, likely due to volume depletion secondary to SBO. Oliguria can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) if not managed promptly. Continued fluid boluses and close monitoring of urine output are necessary.

4. Cancer (Metastatic RCC): The patient has a history of metastatic RCC and has recently undergone chemotherapy with avastin. The oncology team plans a family meeting to discuss prognosis and code status. Pain control should be optimized using appropriate analges"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma admitted to the ICU with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and respiratory distress. The patient's condition is complicated by poor urine output, suspected pneumonia, and potential abdominal compartment syndrome. The patient is unable to provide history due to sedation. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and has been receiving antibiotics for suspected infections.

24-hour events include bloody output from the nasogastric (NG) tube, administration of intravenous fluids (IVF) boluses with continued poor urine output, and consideration of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), obstruction, or abdominal compartment syndrome. The family is uncertain about pursuing a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/90 mmHg to 135/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory system compliance pressure (RSBP) of 103, plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

The patient's physical examination reveals pallor, an endotracheal and NG tube in place, and tenderness in the abdomen with grimacing during"

   initially.
   Given poor PO, n/v, and SBO likely with significant volume depletion.
   Consider also ATN.
   No evidence of hydronephrosis/hydroureter on CT abdomen making
   obstruction less likely.
   Continue fluid boluses as needed, following O2 sat, to achieve 30cc/hr

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) admitted to the ICU with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and respiratory distress. The patient's NG tube output turned bloody, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. She received 4 liters of intravenous fluids (IVF) but continued to have poor urine output, leading to concerns of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), obstruction, or abdominal compartment syndrome. The family is unsure about pursuing a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and is currently receiving propofol, pantoprazole, fentanyl, and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are stable, but she is sedated and unable to provide a history. Review of systems reveals pain as an unchanged symptom since admission.

Flowsheet data shows a total input of 5,318 mL with an output of 945 mL, resulting in a fluid balance of 4,373 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) pending. Her ABG results indicate adequate oxygenation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and small bowel obstruction (SBO). She has a history of allergies to penicillins, and her last doses of antibiotics were levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient is currently sedated and not responding to verbal or physical stimuli, with an endotracheal tube in place. Her vital signs are within normal range, but she has a slightly elevated heart rate. Her blood pressure is stable, and her respiratory rate is on the higher end of normal. Oxygen saturation is at 92%. The patient's weight has increased since admission due to fluid administration.

The patient has been receiving propofol infusion and various medications including fentanyl, which she receives as a patch and boluses. She is also receiving IV fluids and electrolyte repletion as needed. The patient has a history of poor baseline pulmonary function, restrictive lung disease due to SBO, and possible pneumonia. The initial chest X-ray showed improvement in pulmonary edema but indicated that the endotracheal tube should be advanced by 2-3 cm. A recent abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of left renal hydronephrosis. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a 6 cm mass in the right kidney with multiple metastases in the liver.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-inch tall, 91.3 kg male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, small bowel obstruction, and renal cancer. The patient has been sedated and not responding to verbal or physical stimuli with an endotracheal tube in place. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 340 mL, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and a respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 105/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Daily awakening and mouth care should be performed as prophylaxis.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization. Prophylactic measures such as pneumatic compression devices (pneumoboots) should be used.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and small bowel obstruction. She has a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and is currently on avastin treatment. The patient is unresponsive and intubated, making it difficult to obtain a detailed medical history. The patient has allergies to penicillins and has received various antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/112 to 143/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is receiving propofol infusion and other medications such as morphine sulfate and pantoprazole.

Fluid balance shows an input of 3,537 mL and output of 2,047 mL, with a positive balance of 1,490 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has a nasogastric (NG) tube with a large output. There is also a picc line in place.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Blood glucose levels are within normal range, but other lab values including creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), and lactic acid levels"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 60-year-old woman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and small bowel obstruction (SBO).
- She has a history of poor baseline pulmonary function and is currently being treated for pneumonia with vancomycin and levofloxacin.
- The patient's respiratory status will be assessed today through a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to gauge her ability to breathe independently.
- The SBO is causing significant output from the nasogastric (NG) tube, and she is receiving antibiotics for a possible bowel source of infection.
- There is no plan to pursue surgery for the SBO, and the patient will continue to receive Flagyl and levofloxacin for bowel-related infection.
- The patient has a history of RCC and is experiencing oliguria (decreased urine output).
- The patient's pain management is a priority, and she is receiving ICU care, including nutritional support through nasogastric tube and glycemic control.
- The patient has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line, PICC line, and peripheral IV line.
- Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention are being implemented.
- The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an intubated 65-inch-tall, 92.5 kg male with a history of small bowel obstruction (SBO), respiratory distress, and renal cancer. The patient's urine output remains poor, and there is a transient return of bowel sounds overnight. The patient has been switched from pressure support ventilation (PS) to assist-control ventilation (AC). The patient is able to nod and interact with family members while off propofol. 

Infusions include propofol at 35 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications such as morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and fentanyl. The patient has allergies to penicillins and experienced rash with previous antibiotic use. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 88-99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's weight has increased from 75.6 kg at admission to 92.5 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,172 mL and output of 1,196 mL since midnight. 

Respiratory support indicates the use of continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode with assist and autoflow, set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 73, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 27 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 96%. 

ABG results show a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 104%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 23 mEq/L. 

Physical examination reveals the patient to be intubated and sedated, with no response to verbal or physical stimuli. Heart sounds are regular with no murmur. Lung auscultation reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases. The abdomen is firm and distended, with no bowel sounds. No lower extremity edema is present, and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with pneumatic boots is in place. 

Lab results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 5.3 to 6.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 30.5% to 32.6%, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 167 to 185 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) level ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 mg/dL, blood glucose level ranging from 85 to 88 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer, respiratory failure, small bowel obstruction, and anasarca. She is currently in the ICU and has been intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/76 mmHg to 143/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight has increased from 75.6 kg at admission to 92.5 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,172 mL and output of 2,044 mL, with a net balance of 3,744 mL positive. The patient has received a total of 4,172 mL of IV fluids. Respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 5.3 to 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level between 30.5% and 32.6%, platelet count ranging from 167 to 185 K/uL, blood glucose levels between 85 and 88 mg/dL, sodium level between 139 and 142 mEq/L, potassium level between 3.2 and 4.1 mEq/L, and creatinine level between 0.6 and 0.8 mg/dL. 

The patient's imaging shows a CXR that is approximately stable. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessments include respiratory failure, small bowel obstruction, and anasarca. The plan includes trying a spontaneous breathing trial off of sedation, administering Lasix due to anasarca, keeping the nasogastric tube to suction, and discussing total parenteral nutrition (TPN) at a family meeting. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)."

She is sedated and unable to provide her own medical history. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is receiving various medications including propofol, fentanyl, and a pain management patch. She is being monitored closely with hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support through mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs indicate a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 107/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has shown fluctuations in her laboratory results, including slightly elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as low potassium and magnesium levels. Imaging reveals that her chest X-ray is approximately stable. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory failure, small bowel obstruction, and cancer treatment. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to prolonged sedation and intubation, further deterioration of renal function, and complications related to her cancer."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who was admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO) and respiratory distress. She has been extubated but remains in the ICU as a comfort measure only (CMO) due to her advanced cancer diagnosis and poor prognosis.

24-hour events include the removal of an arterial line, a family meeting where the decision for CMO status was made, and extubation. The patient has allergies to penicillins, and she received antibiotics such as levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin within the past day.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/48 mmHg to 121/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on standby ventilator mode with a tidal volume of 1,186 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and spontaneous breathing.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with respiratory failure and small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, renal cancer, and is currently on comfort measures only (CMO) status. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 83/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is sedated and not responding to voice or touch. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds at the bases, no bowel sounds, firm and distended abdomen, and lower extremity edema. Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, high creatinine level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's respiratory support includes an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, standby ventilator mode, and supplemental oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 70%. Imaging studies are not provided in the given information. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the current status of being extubated and relying on supplemental oxygen. Continuous monitoring and support may be necessary.
2. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's SBO can lead to further"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who was admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO). Conservative treatment for SBO did not improve her condition, so a comfort measures only (CMO) status was made last night. The patient appears comfortable and will continue receiving morphine through a drip.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 99 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 76/48 mmHg to 121/82 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) ranging from 8 to 240 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 96%. The patient is on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device and standby ventilator mode. The tidal volume (Vt) is 1,186 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 70%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 5 cmH2O, and plateau pressure is 20 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination findings are not fully assessed due to sedation and inability to provide history. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, as well as abnormal kidney function tests. The patient has been on multiple medications including furosemide, morphine, levofloxacin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, admitted with small bowel obstruction (SBO) that did not improve with conservative treatment. She has been extubated and is on morphine for pain management. The patient is currently comfortable, but she is experiencing respiratory failure and has peripheral edema. Her condition is being managed in the ICU with various interventions, including glycemic control, nutrition, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function if not properly managed.
2. Peripheral Edema: The presence of peripheral edema indicates possible fluid overload or cardiac dysfunction, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction: The underlying SBO may lead to complications like bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis if not addressed promptly.
4. Malignancy: The patient's metastatic renal cell carcinoma increases the risk of further complications related to cancer progression, such as metastasis to other organs or complications from chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
5. Infection: Given the prolonged ICU stay, the patient is at an increased risk of developing infections, including hospital-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or bloodstream infections.
