","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (sCHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with an exacerbation of sCHF and worsening AS. The patient presented with persistent severe dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and was found to have critical AS with a valve area of 0.5cm2 and a gradient of 60. The plan was for the patient to undergo aortic valvuloplasty today.

The patient received Lasix 20 mg IV, resulting in the excretion of 250 cc of urine. Subsequently, his blood pressure dropped to 81/52 mmHg, and he was given 650 cc of normal saline. A urinalysis showed positive nitrite and leukocyte esterase, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics.

Additionally, the patient had guaiac-positive stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is most likely experiencing an upper source of GIB, considering the presence of erythema and congestion in the first, second, and third parts of the duodenum, as seen on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (sCHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with an exacerbation of sCHF and worsening AS. The patient presented with persistent severe dyspnea on exertion (DOE) due to critical AS. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) confirmed the diagnosis of critical AS with a valve area of 0.5 cm2 and a gradient of 60. The plan was for the patient to undergo aortic valvuloplasty today. However, the patient was found to be hypotensive with a blood pressure of 81/52 mmHg after receiving Lasix 20 mg IV. He also had orthopnea and produced 250 cc of urine. The patient was given 650 cc of normal saline (NS) and was subsequently transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be attributed to overdiuresis following the administration of Lasix, resulting in poor forward flow. The hypotension has been managed with fluid resuscitation using 650 cc of NS.

2. New-onset Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient was noted to have AF on admission, which is likely contributing to his"

   cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and worsening of
   AS, who no p/w persistent severe DOE due to critical AS now awaiting
   valvuloplasty.
   # Critical AS: - Recent echo showed valve area 0.5mm2, pt's current
   symptoms of severe DOE due to AS. Awaiting valvulplasty later on today.

   # Critical AS- Recent echo showed valve area 0.5mm2, pt's current
   symptoms of severe DOE due to AS. Now that pt euvolemic and sCHF
   contributing provides more support. Pt does have new Afib on EKG, which
   may be contributing to his SOB/DOE, but less likely since at bedrest pt
   does not have any sympotms.
   - avoid NTG, preload reducers
   - cardiac cath in AM to further evaluate stenosis
   - Liver consult to determine operative risk w/hx of cirrhosis
   - cath will provide data on whether to proceed with valvuloplasty vs.
   AVR
   .
   # New Afib- on EKG pt irregular irregular, rate controlled.
   - starting on hep gtt
   - hold off on bb as rate controlled
   .
   # sCHF, chronic- EF 40%, will hold off on diuresis tonight as
   euvolemic, will restart home dose of lasix 40mg daily as stable on this
   regimen, and would want to prevent volume overload in this patient
   - cont Lasix 20mg qday, start in AM
   .
   # Hyponatremia- previous admission FeNa 1.8%, and thought likely
   secondary to cirhhosis.
   - fluid restrict to 1.5L /day
   .
   # Cirrhosis- First noted during ccy, Likely [**2-29**] EtOH use. Pt reports
   that he stopped drinking approx 1 year ago.documented on MRCP as well
   as CT abdomen. Pt hepatitis panel negative for Hep A,B,C. Pt had liver
   f/u as outpt for possible endoscopy and pre-op Child's classification
   and bleeding risk. Pt did have thombocytopenia and elevated INR on last
   admission (peaked plt 106, and INR 1.6), and started on Vit. K.
   Currently Albumin 3.4, Cr, Tbili normal.
   - continue Vitamin K 5mg daily
   - Liver consult in AM as above
   - checking coags
   .
   # DM2 - continue glipizide, starting ISS
   .
   # HTN - not on any hypertensives, low-dose ACEi and spironolactone d/c
   on last admission, likely due to cirhhosis. Pt also had hypotension
   last admission pt underwent CTA which was negative for PE.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (sCHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent admission for sCHF exacerbation and worsening of AS. The patient presented with persistent severe dyspnea on exertion (DOE) due to critical AS and was scheduled for an aortic valvuloplasty. 

During the course of treatment, the patient received Lasix 20 mg IV and was found to have hypotension with a blood pressure of 81/52 mmHg. The patient also showed leukocytosis, new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF), and guaiac-positive stools. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 103 bpm, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 4 liters of supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's physical examination revealed an irregular and tachycardic heart rhythm with a harsh late-peaking systolic ejection murmur, no appreciable jugular venous distention (JVD), clear lungs, and no organomegaly in the abdomen. 

The patient's recent echocardiogram showed a valve area of 0.5 cm2, indicating critical AS. The patient's symptoms of severe DOE are likely due to the AS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (sCHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus. He was recently admitted with an exacerbation of sCHF and worsening of AS. The patient presented with persistent severe dyspnea on exertion (DOE) due to critical AS and was scheduled for aortic valvuloplasty. He received Lasix, which resulted in significant diuresis and subsequent hypotension. The patient also had guaiac positive stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. He was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) for further management of critical AS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical AS: The patient's narrow aortic valve (area of 0.5 cm2) is causing severe DOE. Valvuloplasty is planned, but there is a risk of complications during the procedure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure dropped after receiving Lasix, indicating volume depletion. He responded to a fluid bolus, but ongoing fluid management is crucial to maintain adequate perfusion.
3. Sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, including leukocytosis, tachycardia, and positive urine analysis. Diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding are possible sources of infection. Empiric antibiotic therapy has been started.
4. Acute Renal Failure: Poor forward flow"

   24 Hour Events: : Mr. [**Known lastname 6286**] is a 79M w/ hx of critical AS (valve area
   0.5cm2), sCHF, alcoholic cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF
   exacerbation and worsening of AS, who p/w persistent severe DOE  on
   [**2168-5-30**]. Please see admit note and team progress notes for more details.
   Briefly, DOE was evaluated by the team with TTE and was found to be
   likely due to critical AS with a valve area of 0.5 and gradient of 60.
   Plan was for patient to undergo aortic valvuloplasty today. Patient
   thought to be slightly overloaded due to othropnea so was given lasix
   20 mg IVx1. Patient put out 250 cc and was found on routine vitals
   check to have BP 81/52, temp 97.1, HR 103, RR 30, and 95% 4L. Patient
   triggered for hypotension as his SBP normally runs in the 110s.
   Patient as given 650 cc of NS. UA with positive Ntr, small LE, and 12
   wbc. CBC shows new leukocytosis. Started empirically on Vanco/Zosyn.
   Also of note patient has had guiac positive stools. Transferred to CCU
   for further management of critical AS.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (sCHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus. The patient was admitted with an exacerbation of sCHF and worsening AS. He presented with persistent severe dyspnea on exertion (DOE) due to critical AS. The patient was scheduled to undergo aortic valvuloplasty but experienced hypotension after receiving lasix 20 mg IV, resulting in the output of 250 cc. The patient's blood pressure was found to be low at 81/52, and he was given 650 cc of normal saline. The patient has leukocytosis and a positive nitrite on urinalysis, indicating a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). He also has guaiac-positive stools, which could suggest gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has been transferred to the CCU for further management of critical AS. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening heart failure due to critical AS and exacerbation of sCHF.
2. Hypotension and shock due to fluid shifts and poor forward flow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical AS: The patient's recent echo showed a valve area of 0.5mm2, which is critical and causing symptoms of severe dyspnea on exertion (DOE). Awaiting valvuloplasty today.
2. Overdiuresis: The patient was overdiuresed yesterday leading to poor forward flow and subsequent hypotension. BP responded to a small fluid bolus of 650 cc on the floor.
3. Sepsis: The patient meets sepsis criteria with positive UA, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, increased respiratory rate, and tachycardia. There is a suspicion of a urinary source. Empiric Vanco/Zosyn started.
4. Acute renal failure: Likely due to poor forward flow in the setting of sepsis and critical AS. Trend Cr. Renally dose meds.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. G positive stools may be due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), but no report of var"

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (valve area 0.5cm2), severe congestive heart failure (EF 40), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and recently admitted with exacerbation of sCHF and worsening AS. The patient is currently awaiting valvuloplasty but is now experiencing sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical AS: The patient's critical aortic stenosis is causing severe symptoms, including persistent severe dyspnea on exertion. This condition requires urgent intervention, and the patient is awaiting valvuloplasty.

2. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis, as indicated by the positive blood cultures growing coagulase-negative staphylococci. There are no peripheral manifestations of endocarditis, and the transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) is negative for vegetations. However, the source of bacteremia is unclear, and sensitivity testing is pending. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, and the dosing will be changed to once daily.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have risen to 1.8 from 1.7 yesterday, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be due to poor forward flow in the setting of sepsis and critical AS.

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (valve area 0.5cm2), systolic heart failure (ejection fraction 40%), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and recently admitted with an exacerbation of systolic heart failure and worsening of AS. The patient is now awaiting valvuloplasty but presents with persistent severe dyspnea on exertion due to critical AS. The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Critical AS: The patient has critical AS by valve area and is awaiting palliative valvuloplasty while clearing bacteremia. The patient's volume status remains tenuous, and he appears to be retaining fluids. Limiting fluid intake as much as possible and utilizing phenylephrine to keep mean arterial pressures (MAPs) greater than 55 due to complications from dobutamine.
2. New onset atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion attempted with success. Chads 2 score is 4. The patient was on heparin but will discontinue due to hematocrit drop. The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm.
3. Sepsis: Urine culture growing coagulase-negative staphylococci and blood cultures growing coagulase-positive staphylococci. No peripheral manifestations of endocarditis, and transesophageal echocardiogram"

   cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and worsening of
   AS, who no p/w persistent severe DOE due to critical AS now awaiting
   valvuloplasty, course complicated by sepsis.
   # Critical AS: AS critical by valve area and awaiting palliative
   valvuloplasy while Bacteremia clears. Volume status remains tenuous,
   and patient appears to be retaining. Limiting fluid intake as much as
   possible and utilizing phenylephrine to keep MAPs greater than 55
   because Dopa was complicated by tachycardia.
   -  Continue phenylephrine for MAPs greater than 55
   -  CXR to assess volume status
   -  Valvuloplasty later this week
   # New onset A fib: Noted on admission. Cardioversion [**6-3**]. Chads 2 is
   4. Was on heparin gtt on the floor but will d/c now given hct drop.
   Appears to be in NSR this am. Not on anticoagulation

   change in renal function

   # Sepsis: Urine culture growing coag. Neg staph and Blood cultures
   growing coag. Positive staph. No peripheral manifestations of
   endocarditis, and TTE negative for vegetations. No obvious sources for
   staph bacteremia. Sensitivities pending. C diff negative x1.
   - Continue Vancomycin but change to Once daily dosing. D/c Zosyn.
   - Check vanco level
   - Follow culture data
   - repeat C diff
   # Acute renal failure: Cr up to 1.8 from 1.6 yesterday. Likely due to
   poor forward flow in the setting of sepsis and critical AS. Fena 0.2.
   - Trend Cr. Renally dose meds
   - goal 250 cc + today
   # Cirrhosis: - Likely [**2-29**] EtOH use. Pt reports that he stopped drinking
   approx 1 year ago.documented on MRCP as well as CT abdomen. Pt
   hepatitis panel negative for Hep A,B,C. G positive stools may be due to
   upper GIB but no report of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6297**] so unlikely variceal bleed.
   In addition EGD [**2168-6-2**] without varices. EGD did show Erythema and
   congestion in the first part of the duodenum, second part of the
   duodenum and third part of the duodenum compatible with mild

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis, severe congestive heart failure, alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and recent admission for an exacerbation of congestive heart failure and worsening of aortic stenosis. He is currently in the ICU awaiting valvuloplasty while being treated for sepsis. The patient's condition is complicated by new-onset atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding.

24-hour events:
- The patient was placed on cordis and started on dopamine for a low blood pressure. Shortly after, he became tachycardic and tachypneic, with a blood pressure in the 70s. Dobutamine was stopped, and phenylephrine was started. The patient received boluses of normal saline, and his central venous pressure (CVP) was measured at 14. Tachycardia and tachypnea improved, and his blood pressure stabilized in the 90s. A chest X-ray showed no pneumothorax, and repeat hematocrit did not suggest bleeding. By 1800 hours, the patient's condition improved.
- The healthcare provider was consulted, and the case was discussed in full. The patient is holding his own line. He received 20mEq of potassium since his potassium level was 3.7. Vancomycin, metronidazole, and Zosyn were administered.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- Allergies: None reported.
- Last doses of antibiotics: Vancomycin - [**2168-6-7**] 09:20 AM, Metronidazole - [**2168-6-7**] 12:00 PM, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) - [**2168-6-7**] 04:30 PM.
- Infusions: Phenylephrine - 2.7 mcg/Kg/min.
- Other ICU medications: Pantoprazole (Protonix) - [**2168-6-7**] 02:00 PM.
- Other medications: None reported.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cough while drinking. No pain, fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting.
- Flowsheet data as of [**2168-6-8**] 06:53 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Critical AS: The patient has critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.5cm^2, awaiting palliative valvuloplasty while clearing bacteremia. His volume status remains tenuous, and he appears to be retaining fluids. Limiting fluid intake as much as possible and utilizing phenylephrine to keep mean arterial pressures (MAPs) greater than 55 because dopamine was complicated by tachycardia.
- Continue phenylephrine for MAPs greater than 55.
- CXR to assess volume status.
- Valvuloplasty later this week.
2. New onset atrial fibrillation: The patient has new-onset atrial fibrillation. Cardioversion was attempted, and heparin was administered. Chads 2 score is 4. He was on heparin on the floor but will be discontinued now given the drop in hematocrit. He appears to be in normal sinus rhythm this morning. Not on anticoagulation.
- Continue dofetilide but plan to reduce dose and hold today given the change in renal function.
- Plan to hold anticoagulation for possible procedure today or tomorrow.
3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with urine culture growing coag-negative staph and blood cultures growing coag-positive staph. No peripheral manifestations of endocarditis, and transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) negative for vegetations. No obvious sources for staph bacteremia. Sensitivities pending. Clostridium difficile negative once.
- Continue Vancomycin but"

   79M w/ hx of critical AS (valve area 0.5cm2), sCHF (EF 40), alcoholic
   cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and worsening of
   AS, who no p/w persistent severe DOE due to critical AS now awaiting
   valvuloplasty, course complicated by sepsis.
   # Critical AS: AS critical by valve area and awaiting palliative
   valvuloplasy while Bacteremia clears. Volume status remains tenuous,
   and patient appears to be retaining. Limiting fluid intake as much as
   possible and utilizing phenylephrine to keep MAPs greater than 55
   because Dopa was complicated by tachycardia.
   -  Continue phenylephrine for MAPs greater than 55
   -  CXR to assess volume status
   -  Valvuloplasty later this week
   # New onset A fib: Noted on admission. Cardioversion [**6-3**]. Chads 2 is
   4. Was on heparin gtt on the floor but will d/c now given hct drop.
   Appears to be in NSR this am. Not on anticoagulation
   -Continue Dofetelide but plan to reduse dose and hold today given
   change in renal function
   - Plan to hold anticoagulation for possible procedure today or tomorrow
   (see above)
   # Sepsis: Urine culture growing coag. Neg staph and Blood cultures
   growing coag. Positive staph. No peripheral manifestations of
   endocarditis, and TTE negative for vegetations. No obvious sources for
   staph bacteremia. Sensitivities pending. C diff negative x1.
   - Continue Vancomycin but change to Once daily dosing. D/c Zosyn.
   - Check vanco level
   - Follow culture data
   - repeat C diff
   # Acute renal failure: Cr up to 1.8 from 1.6 yesterday. Likely due to
   poor forward flow in the setting of sepsis and critical AS. Fena 0.2.
   - Trend Cr. Renally dose meds
   - goal 250 cc + today
   # Cirrhosis: - Likely [**2-29**] EtOH use. Pt reports that he stopped drinking
   approx 1 year ago.documented on MRCP as well as CT abdomen. Pt
   hepatitis panel negative for Hep A,B,C. G positive stools may be due to
   upper GIB but no report of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6297**] so unlikely variceal bleed.
   In addition EGD [**2168-6-2**] without varices. EGD did show Erythema and
   congestion in the first part of the duodenum, second part of the
   duodenum and third part of the duodenum compatible with mild
   duodenitis. Given brown stools, and Hct drop, in the setting of
   heparin, history is most consistent with likely upper source of GIB.
   Hct stable. LFTs increased likely due to shock liver.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (sCHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent admission for sCHF exacerbation and worsening of AS. The patient is awaiting valvuloplasty for critical AS. His current condition is complicated by sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical AS: The patient has critical AS with a valve area of 0.5 cm2 and is awaiting valvuloplasty. This condition can lead to symptoms such as severe dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and may require surgical intervention.
2. Sepsis: The patient's course is complicated by sepsis, as indicated by positive blood cultures growing coag-positive staphylococci and negative urine cultures. This infection may require aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.6 to 1.8, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be due to poor forward flow in the setting of sepsis and critical AS. Renal dosing of medications and fluid restriction may be necessary.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis, likely exacerbated by chronic ethanol use. This condition may contribute to portal hypertension and an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation. The patient's 24-hour events include being placed on cordis and started on dobutamine for a low blood pressure in the high 60s. The patient then became tachycardic with a heart rate in the 140s, tachypneic with a respiratory rate in the high 30s, and had a blood pressure in the 70s. Dobutamine was stopped, phenylephrine was started, and the patient received boluses of normal saline. The patient's condition improved, with tachycardia and tachypnea resolving, blood pressure improving to the 90s, and a chest X-ray showing no pneumothorax. Repeat hematocrit was not suggestive of bleeding, and the patient's condition further improved by 1800 hours.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is experiencing an abnormal heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating.
2. Dysphagia: The patient may be having difficulty swallowing, which can be a result of various conditions such as muscle weakness or neurological disorders.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has deteriorated suddenly, leading to decreased urine output and elevated blood creatinine levels.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (sCHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus. He was recently admitted with an exacerbation of sCHF and worsening of AS. The patient is currently awaiting valvuloplasty.

The patient presented with persistent severe dyspnea on exertion due to critical AS. He was overdiuresed yesterday, leading to poor forward flow and subsequent hypotension. The patient also had profuse diarrhea, which may have caused volume shifts. His blood pressure responded to a small fluid bolus of 650 cc on the floor. 

The plan is to hold off on further fluids and aim for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 55. If needed, peripheral dopamine can be administered. The patient is scheduled for valvuloplasty today.

The patient has a new onset of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is currently rate-controlled. Cardioversion is considered, but the patient's Chads 2 score is 4, and he is on heparin. 

The patient also meets the criteria for sepsis, with positive urine analysis indicating a possible urinary source. He has low-grade fever, leukocytosis, increased respiratory rate, and tachycardia. Cultures"

He was admitted with an exacerbation of CHF and worsening AS. The patient presented with severe dyspnea on exertion (DOE) due to critical AS and is awaiting valvuloplasty.

During the 24-hour period, the patient received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and was placed on dopamine for hypotension. He also received phenylephrine to maintain blood pressure. The patient's condition improved, and his tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension resolved. A chest X-ray was obtained, which showed no pneumothorax. A repeat hematocrit (HCT) was not suggestive of bleeding.

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate (HR) of 83 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 93/55 mmHg to 98/73 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%.

   cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and worsening of
   AS, who no p/w persistent severe DOE due to critical AS now awaiting
   valvuloplasty.
   # Critical AS: Recent echo showed valve area 0.5mm2, pt's current
   symptoms of severe DOE due to AS. Awaiting valvulplasty later on today.
   [**Month (only) 8**] have been overdiuresed yesterday leading to poor forward flow and
   subsequent hypotension. Although patient only put out 300 cc to lasix,
   patient did have profuse diarrhea which may have also led to volume
   shifts. BP has responded to small fluid bolus of 650 cc on the floor.
   -  Plan to hold off on further fluids. Goal MAP greater than 55.
   Peripheral dopamine if needed. Will hold on further fluids for now.
   - Plan for Valvuloplasty today
   # New onset A fib: Noted on admission. Cardioversion [**6-3**]. Chads 2 is
   4. Was on heparin gtt on the floor but will d/c now given hct drop.
   Appears in a fib right now on tele, but rate controlled less than 100.
   -Hold heparin gtt
   -active t and s
   - 12 lead EKG now
   - Continue dofetelide
   # Sepsis: Given diarrhea, Cdiff in differential, even though C diff
   negative x1. UA points to possible urinary source. Patient had
   previously reported a cough but may have been due to over hydration.
   Patient does meet sepsis criteria with positive UA, in addition to low
   grade fever, leukocytosis, increase RR, and tachycardia. Waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 226**] MS may be delirium.
   - Start empiric Vanco/Zosyn
   - Follow culture data
   - Will need central access
   - repeat C diff
   # Acute renal failure: Likely due to poor forward flow in the setting
   of sepsis and critical AS.
   - Trend Cr. Renally dose meds
   - Urine lytes
   # Cirrhosis: - Likely [**2-29**] EtOH use. Pt reports that he stopped drinking
   approx 1 year ago.documented on MRCP as well as CT abdomen. Pt
   hepatitis panel negative for Hep A,B,C. G positive stools may be due to
   upper GIB but no report of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6297**] so unlikely variceal bleed.
   In addition EGD [**2168-6-2**] without varices. EGD did show Erythema and
   congestion in the first part of the duodenum, second part of the
   duodenum and third part of the duodenum compatible with mild
   duodenitis. Given brown stools, and Hct drop, in the setting of
   heparin, history is most consistent with likely upper source of GIB.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis, severe congestive heart failure, alcoholic cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with an exacerbation of sCHF and worsening AS. The patient's symptoms include severe dyspnea on exertion due to critical AS and is awaiting valvuloplasty. The patient was overdiuresed yesterday, leading to poor forward flow and subsequent hypotension. A small fluid bolus was given, and the patient's blood pressure responded. The plan is to hold off on further fluids and aim for a MAP greater than 55. Peripheral dopamine may be used if needed. The patient is also being planned for valvuloplasty today.

Medical Complications:
1. Critical Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has severe dyspnea on exertion due to critical AS. Valvuloplasty is planned today to address this condition.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure due to poor forward flow in the setting of sepsis and critical AS.
3. Sepsis: The patient meets sepsis criteria with positive UA, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, increased respiratory rate, and tachycardia. Empiric Vanco/Zosyn was started, and cultures are being followed.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (CHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent admission with sCHF exacerbation and worsening of AS. He is currently in the ICU awaiting valvuloplasty. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, which was caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). He has shown improvement in his renal function and is no longer in septic shock. The patient has hyponatremia, likely due to hypovolemia from being NPO. His anxiety and pain are being managed with medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already experienced sepsis and required treatment with antibiotics. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection or bacteremia.
2. Critical AS: The patient's critical aortic stenosis will be addressed with a valvuloplasty procedure today. Complications related to the procedure, such as bleeding or damage to adjacent structures, need to be considered.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating hyponatremia. This condition can lead to symptoms like confusion, seizures, or muscle weakness if not corrected properly.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels were elevated on admission but have improved"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and recent admission with severe congestive heart failure exacerbation. He is currently in the ICU for sepsis due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection. The patient's condition is complicated by acute renal failure, hyponatremia, cirrhosis with positive stools, potential aspiration, anxiety, pain, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient's critical aortic valve area of 0.5 cm2 indicates severe obstruction of blood flow from the heart. This condition can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and syncope. If left untreated, it can result in heart failure, arrhythmias, or even sudden cardiac death.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis caused by MSSA infection. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection triggers widespread inflammation. If not promptly treated, sepsis can lead to organ failure, shock, and death.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. Acute kidney injury can occur due to various reasons, including severe infection, low blood volume, or medication toxicity. It requires"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (CHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and recent admission for worsening CHF exacerbation and critical AS. The patient is currently in the ICU awaiting valvuloplasty and has had a complicated course with sepsis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical AS: The patient's critical AS can lead to symptoms such as severe dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and can result in heart failure. The planned valvuloplasty aims to improve the patient's symptoms and cardiac function.
2. New-onset atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient was noted to have AF on admission, which has been cardioverted back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The patient is at risk for recurrent episodes of AF due to his underlying cardiac condition.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hypovolemic hyponatremia likely due to poor oral intake. Close monitoring of sodium levels and fluid management is necessary to prevent complications related to electrolyte imbalance.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which may be improving with better hemodynamics. Renal dosing of medications and maintaining adequate urine output are important for preventing further renal deterioration.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis,"

He is currently awaiting valvuloplasty. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis and hypotension. He has been receiving phenylephrine for mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 55. Daily chest X-ray (CXR) is being performed to assess volume status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical AS: The patient's critical aortic valve narrowing may lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. If not addressed, it can progress to heart failure and potentially be life-threatening.
2. New-onset atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient has developed new-onset AF, which increases the risk of stroke and requires anticoagulation management.
3. Sepsis: The patient is currently recovering from sepsis caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Monitoring for any signs of infection or bacteremia is crucial.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved but need close monitoring. Renal dosing of medications and maintaining adequate fluid balance are important.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (sCHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent admission for sCHF exacerbation and worsening AS. He is currently in the ICU due to sepsis and awaiting valvuloplasty. The patient's volume status is tenuous, and he appears to be retaining fluids. His renal function has also deteriorated, and he has acute renal failure. Additionally, he has evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), likely due to duodenitis rather than variceal bleeding. The patient's condition is complicated by new-onset atrial fibrillation (A fib), which is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical AS: The patient's critical aortic valve area requires valvuloplasty, which is planned for later this week. This procedure aims to improve the patient's symptoms and quality of life.
2. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing bacteremia with coagulase-negative staphylococcus in the urine and positive staphylococcus in blood cultures. Sensitivities are pending, and the patient is currently being treated with vancomycin. Close monitoring and follow-up on culture data are necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.6 to 1.8, indicating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (CHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent admission for exacerbation of CHF and worsening of AS. He is currently in the ICU awaiting valvuloplasty and is also dealing with sepsis. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, new-onset atrial fibrillation, cirrhosis, possible gastrointestinal bleeding, and potential aspiration risk. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Critical AS: The patient's critical aortic stenosis is severe and may lead to further cardiac complications if not addressed promptly.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently battling sepsis, as indicated by the presence of bacteremia and positive blood cultures. This can pose a significant risk to his overall health and well-being.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with an increase in creatinine levels. This could be due to poor forward flow in the setting of sepsis and critical AS.
4. New-onset Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of stroke and requires anticoagulation management.
5. Cirrhosis: The patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis may contribute to complications such as portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome.
6. Possible Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's presentation of brown stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration suggests a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed.
7. Aspiration Risk: The patient has reported coughing with thin liquids, indicating a potential risk for aspiration pneumonia.
8. Compromised Renal Function: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring and adjustment of medications accordingly.
9. Infection Control: Given the presence of bacteremia and positive blood cultures, it is crucial to implement appropriate infection control measures to prevent the spread of infection.

Overall, the patient faces multiple complex medical challenges that require careful management and coordination to optimize his chances of recovery."

   79M w/ hx of critical AS (valve area 0.5cm2), sCHF (EF 40), alcoholic
   cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and worsening of
   AS, later developed MSSA sepsis and now s/p aortic valvuloplasty and
   PTCA to RCA on [**2168-6-9**].
   # Sepsis: Bacteria identified as MSSA. Surveillance cultures no growth
   . No peripheral manifestations of endocarditis, and TTE negative for
   vegetations. No obvious sources for staph bacteremia. Sensitivities
   pending. C diff negative x1.
   - D/c Vanco and Start Nafcillin.
   - Wean phenylephrine as tolerated now that past septic shock and will
   help reduce afterload in setting of critical as
   - Repeat surveillance cx today
   # Critical AS: AS critical by valve area. Plan to undergo valvuloplasty
   today. CXR looks improved today in regards to cephalization. .
   -  Continue phenylephrine for MAPs greater than 55
   -  daily CXR to assess volume status
   -  Valvuloplasty today

   Not on anticoagulation  while awaiting procedure. Has been in NSR last
   24 hrs.
   - Continue Dofetelide at reduced dose
   - Plan to hold anticoagulation for procedure today (see above). Will
   readress anticoagulation post-procedure.
   # Hyponatremia: Given exam, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia from being
   NPO. Will give fluid gently as needed (see below)
   # Acute renal failure: Cr improved to 1.3 today from 1.8. Likely
   improving with better hemodynamics in the setting of resolving septic
   shock.. Fena 0.2.
   - Trend Cr. Renally dose meds

","Summary:
The patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (CHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and recent admission with an exacerbation of CHF and worsening AS. He developed MSSA sepsis and underwent an aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the right coronary artery (RCA) on [date].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient had MSSA bacteremia and was treated with nafcillin. Surveillance cultures remain negative, but sensitivities are pending. There are no obvious sources for the staph bacteremia.
2. Critical AS: The patient's AS is critical with a valve area of 0.5 cm2. He underwent valvuloplasty today, and phenylephrine will be weaned as tolerated. Daily chest X-rays will be done to assess volume status.
3. New-onset atrial fibrillation (A fib): The patient was in AFib on admission and cardioverted back to sinus rhythm. He has a CHADS2 score of 4, indicating a high risk for stroke. Dofetilide dosage will be reduced, and anticoagulation will be addressed post-procedure.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient is hyponatremic, likely due to being NPO. Fluid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis, severe congestive heart failure, alcoholic cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with an exacerbation of CHF and worsening AS. He is awaiting valvuloplasty but has developed MSSA bacteremia. The patient's medical complications include sepsis, critical AS, new-onset atrial fibrillation, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, cirrhosis with positive stools, possible aspiration risk, anxiety/pain, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not managed appropriately.
2. Critical AS: The patient's critical aortic stenosis may worsen and result in further complications such as syncope, heart failure exacerbation, or even sudden cardiac death.
3. New-onset atrial fibrillation: The patient's recent development of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of embolic events, including stroke.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia needs to be corrected carefully to avoid complications like seizures or neurological damage.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
6. Cirrhosis with positive stools: This suggests the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding or malabsorption.

   SUB-INTERN ADDENDUM
   Assessment:
   79 y/o M with critical AS, CHF (EF40%), alcoholic cirrhosis, DM,
   admitted for worsening DOE, out from septic shock, now recorvering from
   valvuloplasty.
   # Septic shock.  His shock was caused by MSSA as identified by blood
   and urine cultures on [**6-6**]. Surveillance cultures were still positive
   on [**6-7**] but on [**6-8**] and [**6-9**] have been NGTD. Based on sensitivities he
   was started on nafcillin on [**6-8**] and he is now day 2 of 14 and he is
   now afebrile with a stable white count.  He is over the acute phase of
   his sepsis as his MAPs are increasing with lower doses of phenylephrine
   (today at 0.4) and with a net positive fluid balance of only about 500
   cc yesterday. We can continue to wean him off the phenylephrine and
   keep his fluid balance even as he is becoming more hemodynamically
   stable.
   #CHF.  The patient has a history of CHF with EF of 45%, but upon the
   start of his sepsis he had an EF of 20%. This most likely was due to a
   stunned myocardium that resulted from increased work and stress to
   maintain sufficient cardiac output against his dropping blood pressure
   (from sepsis) as well as the extremely large gradient across his aortic
   valve due to his severe aortic stenosis. Now that his septic shock is
   nearly over, his CHF should improve and we should see an improvement in
   his pulmonary and peripheral edema. However, because of his severe
   aortic stenosis and his low baseline ejection fraction, he will always
   have some level of edema even if he diurese him. In fact, if we diurese
   him too much he will become intravascularly depleted
 and that
   exactly what happened as evidenced by his rising creatinine (ARF due to
   insufficient blood flow to kidney), highly concentrated urine (U-osm
   600 and U-Na <10), and hyponatremia (since he was intravascularly
   depleted, his pituitary made more ADH to hold onto free water which
   caused dilution of his Na). At this point we will allow him to slowly
   replete volume (0 to 500cc positive) as we want to be careful not to
   cause too much pulmonary edema that he would need a ventilator since he
   is DNI. In the long term, we will soon restart his out-patient CHF
   therapy, including a beta blocker, ace inhibitor, possibly lasix, and
   aldactone. He will probably need an echo as an outpatient as well to
   determine if his EF is getting better.
   #Aortic stenosis.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Hospital 6402**] Medical
   Student  on:[**2168-6-10**] 13:36 ------
   # Aortic stenosis.  Yesterday he had aortic valvuloplasty that managed
   to decrease his aortic valve pressure gradient from approximately 60 mm
   Hg to 50 mm Hg. According to the Hakki equation, Aortic Valve Area
   (cm^2) = cardiac output (L/min) / sqrt (valve pressure gradient [mm Hg]
   ). His pre-procedure aortic valve area, given a pressure gradient of 60
   mm Hg and an estimated cardiac output of 4L/min, was approximately
   *0.52 cm*. Given his new gradient of approximately 50 mm Hg, his
   post-procedure aortic valve area is *0.57 cm* (normal aortic valve is
   >2cm). The procedure was not successful in significantly increasing his
   aortic valve area most likely because the valve was very calcific and
   hard to open. The procedure that is most likely to eliminate his aortic
   stenosis is valve replacement. However, because the patient knows that
   he is at the end of his life, he wants to have minimal additional
   procedures and does not want to undergo this kind of major operation.
   Therefore, at this time we will manage his aortic stenosis as best as
   we can with cautious and conservative medical management.
   # CAD.  During the valvuloplasty yesterday, the patient was found to
   have approximately 90% stenosis of his right coronary artery. As a
   result, 2 bare metal stents were placed and he was loaded with
   clopidogrel. Due to the high risk of clot developing on the stent, the
   patient needs to be started on clopidogrel for at least one month and a
   full dose of aspirin. Since stenosis of the coronary arteries is most
   often due to cholesterol plaques, we should evaluate his lipids with a
   full lipid panel and start him on a high dose statin (probably
   simvastatin because it is cheap and probably as effective as
   atorvastatin). Otherwise, a beta-blocker could be added in the future
   to decrease strain on the heart and decrease the risk of acute coronary
   syndrome.
   # Afib.  The patient is written for dofetilide for rhythm control of
   his atrial fibrillation. We can increase his dose to 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] since
   he is no longer in renal failure. In terms of anti-coagulation, this is
   going to be an important issue to discuss with the patient himself. His
   risk of developing a clot and embolus resulting in stroke is very high
   (CHADS2 score gives him an 8.5% chance of stroke in the following year,
   and his catheterization procedure also increases his stroke risk).
   Logically we would like to start this patient on some aggressive
   anti-coagulation. However, we have to balance the stroke risk against
   his risk of massive hemorrhage. His bleed risk is low, however, since
   he is unlikely to have any falls (he is mostly immobile), he does not
   have hypertension that would lead to intracranial hemorrhage, and his
   only risk factor is a past history of GI bleed. We have to weigh all of
   these choices with the patient
s goals of care.
   # Other problems. The patients other problems are as outlines above.

   concur with the history and physical examination over the past 24 hours
   documented above.   The examination is consistent with my examination
   today.   Balloon aortic valvulopasty yesterday resulted in a modest
   improvement of his aortic valve gradient and stenting of his RCA using
   a bare metal stent.    We have reviewed the prognosis with the patient
   and will continue to discuss additional therapeutic plans with the
   patient over the next several days.   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3051**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6109**], MD  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6129**]

","Summary:
- The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and recent exacerbation of CHF.
- He was admitted with worsening dyspnea on exertion and now recovering from aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to RCA.
- The patient developed MSSA bacteremia, which was treated with nafcillin.
- His renal function has improved, but he remains hyponatremic, and his sodium levels are being managed with normal saline (NS) instead of D5W.
- He is still in atrial fibrillation but rate-controlled post-procedure.
- The patient's aortic valve area increased from 0.52 cm^2 to 0.57 cm^2 after valvuloplasty, but he still has significant aortic stenosis.
- He also underwent stenting of the RCA, for which he will be started on clopidogrel and aspirin.
- The patient's other problems include sepsis, CHF, cirrhosis with positive stools, possible aspiration, anxiety/pain, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient was previously diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, but surveillance cultures are now negative. Close monitoring for any signs of sepsis recurrence is essential.

   SUB-INTERN ADDENDUM
   Assessment:
   79 y/o M with critical AS, CHF (EF40%), alcoholic cirrhosis, DM,
   admitted for worsening DOE, out from septic shock, now recorvering from
   valvuloplasty.
   # Septic shock.  His shock was caused by MSSA as identified by blood
   and urine cultures on [**6-6**]. Surveillance cultures were still positive
   on [**6-7**] but on [**6-8**] and [**6-9**] have been NGTD. Based on sensitivities he
   was started on nafcillin on [**6-8**] and he is now day 2 of 14 and he is
   now afebrile with a stable white count.  He is over the acute phase of
   his sepsis as his MAPs are increasing with lower doses of phenylephrine
   (today at 0.4) and with a net positive fluid balance of only about 500
   cc yesterday. We can continue to wean him off the phenylephrine and
   keep his fluid balance even as he is becoming more hemodynamically
   stable.
   #CHF.  The patient has a history of CHF with EF of 45%, but upon the
   start of his sepsis he had an EF of 20%. This most likely was due to a
   stunned myocardium that resulted from increased work and stress to
   maintain sufficient cardiac output against his dropping blood pressure
   (from sepsis) as well as the extremely large gradient across his aortic
   valve due to his severe aortic stenosis. Now that his septic shock is
   nearly over, his CHF should improve and we should see an improvement in
   his pulmonary and peripheral edema. However, because of his severe
   aortic stenosis and his low baseline ejection fraction, he will always
   have some level of edema even if he diurese him. In fact, if we diurese
   him too much he will become intravascularly depleted
 and that
   exactly what happened as evidenced by his rising creatinine (ARF due to
   insufficient blood flow to kidney), highly concentrated urine (U-osm
   600 and U-Na <10), and hyponatremia (since he was intravascularly
   depleted, his pituitary made more ADH to hold onto free water which
   caused dilution of his Na). At this point we will allow him to slowly
   replete volume (0 to 500cc positive) as we want to be careful not to
   cause too much pulmonary edema that he would need a ventilator since he
   is DNI. In the long term, we will soon restart his out-patient CHF
   therapy, including a beta blocker, ace inhibitor, possibly lasix, and
   aldactone. He will probably need an echo as an outpatient as well to
   determine if his EF is getting better.
   #Aortic stenosis.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Hospital 6402**] Medical
   Student  on:[**2168-6-10**] 13:36 ------
   # Aortic stenosis.  Yesterday he had aortic valvuloplasty that managed
   to decrease his aortic valve pressure gradient from approximately 60 mm
   Hg to 50 mm Hg. According to the Hakki equation, Aortic Valve Area
   (cm^2) = cardiac output (L/min) / sqrt (valve pressure gradient [mm Hg]
   ). His pre-procedure aortic valve area, given a pressure gradient of 60
   mm Hg and an estimated cardiac output of 4L/min, was approximately
   *0.52 cm*. Given his new gradient of approximately 50 mm Hg, his
   post-procedure aortic valve area is *0.57 cm* (normal aortic valve is
   >2cm). The procedure was not successful in significantly increasing his
   aortic valve area most likely because the valve was very calcific and
   hard to open. The procedure that is most likely to eliminate his aortic
   stenosis is valve replacement. However, because the patient knows that
   he is at the end of his life, he wants to have minimal additional
   procedures and does not want to undergo this kind of major operation.
   Therefore, at this time we will manage his aortic stenosis as best as
   we can with cautious and conservative medical management.
   # CAD.  During the valvuloplasty yesterday, the patient was found to
   have approximately 90% stenosis of his right coronary artery. As a
   result, 2 bare metal stents were placed and he was loaded with
   clopidogrel. Due to the high risk of clot developing on the stent, the
   patient needs to be started on clopidogrel for at least one month and a
   full dose of aspirin. Since stenosis of the coronary arteries is most
   often due to cholesterol plaques, we should evaluate his lipids with a
   full lipid panel and start him on a high dose statin (probably
   simvastatin because it is cheap and probably as effective as
   atorvastatin). Otherwise, a beta-blocker could be added in the future
   to decrease strain on the heart and decrease the risk of acute coronary
   syndrome.
   # Afib.  The patient is written for dofetilide for rhythm control of
   his atrial fibrillation. We can increase his dose to 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] since
   he is no longer in renal failure. In terms of anti-coagulation, this is
   going to be an important issue to discuss with the patient himself. His
   risk of developing a clot and embolus resulting in stroke is very high
   (CHADS2 score gives him an 8.5% chance of stroke in the following year,
   and his catheterization procedure also increases his stroke risk).
   Logically we would like to start this patient on some aggressive
   anti-coagulation. However, we have to balance the stroke risk against
   his risk of massive hemorrhage. His bleed risk is low, however, since
   he is unlikely to have any falls (he is mostly immobile), he does not
   have hypertension that would lead to intracranial hemorrhage, and his
   only risk factor is a past history of GI bleed. We have to weigh all of
   these choices with the patient
s goals of care.
   # Other problems. The patients other problems are as outlines above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis (AS), congestive heart failure (CHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent history of worsening dyspnea on exertion (DOE), was admitted for septic shock caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. Surveillance cultures remained negative.
- The patient underwent aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to RCA with placement of two bare-metal stents (BMS). He was loaded with Plavix.
- His condition improved, and he was weaned off phenylephrine and maintained a positive fluid balance of 500 cc.
- The patient's creatinine level improved from 1.3 to 1.1, indicating resolving acute renal failure.
- He developed hyponatremia, likely due to low intake and insensible losses, and was managed with a change in IV fluids from D5W to normal saline (NS).
- The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. His EF decreased to 20% during sepsis but is expected to improve now that his septic shock is resolving.
- He has severe AS, and his valve area was increased from approximately 0.52 cm to 0.57 cm after valvuloplasty.

   SUB-INTERN ADDENDUM
   Assessment:
   79 y/o M with critical AS, CHF (EF40%), alcoholic cirrhosis, DM,
   admitted for worsening DOE, out from septic shock, now recorvering from
   valvuloplasty.
   # Septic shock.  His shock was caused by MSSA as identified by blood
   and urine cultures on [**6-6**]. Surveillance cultures were still positive
   on [**6-7**] but on [**6-8**] and [**6-9**] have been NGTD. Based on sensitivities he
   was started on nafcillin on [**6-8**] and he is now day 2 of 14 and he is
   now afebrile with a stable white count.  He is over the acute phase of
   his sepsis as his MAPs are increasing with lower doses of phenylephrine
   (today at 0.4) and with a net positive fluid balance of only about 500
   cc yesterday. We can continue to wean him off the phenylephrine and
   keep his fluid balance even as he is becoming more hemodynamically
   stable.
   #CHF.  The patient has a history of CHF with EF of 45%, but upon the
   start of his sepsis he had an EF of 20%. This most likely was due to a
   stunned myocardium that resulted from increased work and stress to
   maintain sufficient cardiac output against his dropping blood pressure
   (from sepsis) as well as the extremely large gradient across his aortic
   valve due to his severe aortic stenosis. Now that his septic shock is
   nearly over, his CHF should improve and we should see an improvement in
   his pulmonary and peripheral edema. However, because of his severe
   aortic stenosis and his low baseline ejection fraction, he will always
   have some level of edema even if he diurese him. In fact, if we diurese
   him too much he will become intravascularly depleted
 and that
   exactly what happened as evidenced by his rising creatinine (ARF due to
   insufficient blood flow to kidney), highly concentrated urine (U-osm
   600 and U-Na <10), and hyponatremia (since he was intravascularly
   depleted, his pituitary made more ADH to hold onto free water which
   caused dilution of his Na). At this point we will allow him to slowly
   replete volume (0 to 500cc positive) as we want to be careful not to
   cause too much pulmonary edema that he would need a ventilator since he
   is DNI. In the long term, we will soon restart his out-patient CHF
   therapy, including a beta blocker, ace inhibitor, possibly lasix, and
   aldactone. He will probably need an echo as an outpatient as well to
   determine if his EF is getting better.
   #Aortic stenosis.

","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis, severe congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 40%), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and recent admission for worsening dyspnea on exertion. He also developed MSSA sepsis and underwent aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the right coronary artery (RCA) on 6/9. 

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient had MSSA bacteremia, but surveillance cultures have shown no growth. There are no peripheral manifestations of endocarditis, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was negative for vegetations. The source of staph bacteremia is unclear. The patient will continue on nafcillin for 14 days.

2. Critical aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic valve area is severely narrowed (0.5 cm2), and he underwent valvuloplasty on 6/9. Repeat TEE is planned.

3. Coronary artery disease: The patient had BMS placed in the RCA on 6/9. Plavix will be continued for at least 3 months.

4. New-onset atrial fibrillation: The patient was in atrial fibrillation on admission. Cardioversion was attempted on 6/3. The patient's Chads"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis (AS), systolic congestive heart failure (sCHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and a recent history of sepsis. The patient underwent an aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the right coronary artery (RCA) on [**2168-6-9**]. The patient's condition remains unstable with hypotension, critical AS, acute renal failure, and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is attributed to poor ejection fraction, aortic stenosis, bacteremia/sepsis. The patient's elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) suggests that he may need assistance with ionotropy rather than diuresis. Neosynephrine was increased overnight, and the goal is to decrease neosynephrine as tolerated while maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55.
2. Critical AS: The patient's aortic valve area is critically narrowed, and the patient recently underwent a valvuloplasty. Close monitoring and management of cardiac function are necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has risen from 1.0 to 1.9 within the past 24 hours, likely due to contrast-induced neph"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (sCHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent admission for sCHF exacerbation and worsening of AS. He developed MSSA sepsis and underwent aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the right coronary artery (RCA) on [**2168-6-9**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has several contributors to his hypotension, including poor ejection fraction, aortic stenosis, and bacteremia/sepsis. His examination suggests dehydration, so fluid resuscitation and ionotropic support may be required.
2. Critical AS: The patient's aortic valve area is critically narrowed. He underwent valvuloplasty on [**6-9**] to alleviate the obstruction.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 1.9 within the past 24 hours, indicating possible acute renal failure. Contrast-induced nephropathy could be a major contributor to this rise. The patient appears dehydrated on examination, and limited oral intake may contribute to the renal dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/45 mmHg to 109/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention while lying flat, regular heart sounds with a harsh late peaking semisternal murmur, clear to auscultation lungs, and no organomegaly. The patient has mild peripheral edema and decreased urine output.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, low total carbon dioxide level, and elevated blood glucose levels. Coagulation studies indicate prolonged PT/INR and PTT. Cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, indicating a potential ongoing infection. Prolonged antibiotic use can lead to antibiotic resistance or secondary infections.

2. Cardiovascular issues: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation, along with the presence of a harsh late peaking semisternal murmur, suggests possible underlying cardiac pathology. The patient's"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis (valve area 0.5 cm2), severe congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 40%), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and recent admission with severe congestive heart failure exacerbation and worsening of aortic stenosis. The patient later developed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis and underwent aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the right coronary artery on [**2168-6-9**].

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MSSA sepsis and is currently on nafcillin. There are no peripheral manifestations of endocarditis, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) negative for vegetations. However, the patient may still be at risk for developing sepsis again or experiencing a recurrence of MSSA bacteremia.

2. Critical aortic stenosis (AS): The patient's AS is critical with a valve area of 0.5 cm2. Although the patient underwent aortic valvuloplasty, there is a risk of restenosis or worsening of AS over time. Close monitoring and follow-up will be necessary to assess the effectiveness of the valvuloplasty and determine if further interventions are required.

3. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has severe CHF with an ejection fraction of 40%. The patient's condition may worsen due to the increased preload and afterload from the critical AS. Optimization of heart failure medications and monitoring for signs of fluid overload will be important.

4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient underwent PTCA to the right coronary artery on [**2168-6-9**]. There is a risk of restenosis or development of new coronary artery lesions. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status and follow-up coronary angiography may be necessary to assess the patency of the coronary arteries.

5. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient was noted to have new-onset AF on admission. Cardioversion was attempted on [**2168-6-3**]. The patient's CHADS2 score is 4, which indicates a high risk of thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin or warfarin may be necessary to reduce the risk of stroke.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient's serum creatinine has improved from 1.3 to 1.0. However, the patient may still be at risk for renal dysfunction due to pre-existing chronic kidney disease, sepsis, or decreased renal perfusion.

7. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is improving. Close monitoring"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall male with a chief complaint of being in the ICU. The patient has a history of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient received three 250cc normal saline boluses due to low mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 40s. However, this did not result in any urine output (UOP), and the patient's creatinine levels continued to rise from 1.0 to 1.9 to 2.2 to 2.9. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels also increased from 44 to 61 to 54. 

The patient was initially on norepinephrine but was switched to levophed due to not tolerating dopamine well previously. Despite this, the patient still had no urine output by 9:00 PM. A 500cc normal saline bolus was given without any improvement in UOP. 

The patient's stool samples were guaiac positive with nonmelanotic blood, and a C. difficile toxin was sent. Additionally, the patient has slight oozing at the groin site with bruising, a small underlying hematoma, and a soft, nontender thigh. 

The patient has no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2168-6-11**] at 05:30 PM. The patient is currently on heparin sodium infusion at 300 units/hour, norepinephrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/min, and pantopraz"

   79M with critical AS (valve area 0.5cm2), sCHF (EF 40%), alcoholic
   cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and worsening of
   AS, later developed MSSA sepsis and now s/p aortic valvuloplasty and
   PTCA to RCA on [**2168-6-9**].
   # Hypotension:  Several contributors, including poor ejection fraction,
   aortic stenosis, bactermia/sepsis. Patient still with elevated PCWP. On
   exam, does not appear volume up, suggesting that rather than diuresis,
   patient may need assistance with ionotropy. In fact, given exam and low
   urine sodium, patient appears dehydrated (despite net positive fluid
   balance for hospital course
 does not take into account insensible
   losses). Neosynephrine was increased overnight.
   -          Decrease neosynephrine as tolerated; goal MAP>55
   -          Small fluid bolus (NS 250cc)
   # Critical AS: AS critical by valve area. Now s/p valvuloplasty [**6-9**].
   # Acute renal failure:  Creatinine increased from 1.0 to 1.9 within
   past 24 hours. Previous labs have shown a prerenal etiology. Given time
   course, likely major contributor for acute rise here contrast-induced
   nephropathy. As above, patient still does appear dry on exam, and has
   limited PO intake.
   -          Trend creatinine
   -          Urine lytes
   -          250cc bolus, as above
   -          Goal I/O net even to slightly positive
   # Sepsis:  MSSA bacteremia. Surveillance cultures no growth to date.
   Last positive blood culture was [**2168-6-7**]. TTE negative for vegetations.
   No obvious sources for bacteremia.
   -          Continue Nafcillin (GPC coverage started [**2168-6-7**]), day 5 of
   14
   -          Wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   # CAD: BMS x2 to RCA [**2168-6-9**]. Plavix loaded with 300mg PO
   -          Continue Plavix for at least 3 months
   -          Continue simvastatin, ASA
   -          Beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor held given low BP
   # PAF: Noted on admission. Cardioversion [**6-3**]. CHADS2 = 4.
   -          Continue dofetelide, renally dosed

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis, systolic heart failure (ejection fraction of 40%), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and a history of myocardial infarction. He was admitted with a worsening exacerbation of systolic heart failure and developed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis. He underwent an aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the right coronary artery on 06/09.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension due to poor ejection fraction, aortic stenosis, and bacteremia/sepsis. Despite having a net positive fluid balance, the patient appears dehydrated, suggesting the need for ionotropic support rather than diuresis. Norepinephrine (Neo) was increased overnight.
- Critical AS: The patient's aortic valve is critically stenotic, and he has undergone valvuloplasty.
- Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have risen from 1.0 to 1.9 within the past 24 hours, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient appears dry on examination and has limited oral intake.
- Sepsis: The patient had MSSA bacteremia, which is now negative. No"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis (AS), severe congestive heart failure (CHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with an exacerbation of CHF and worsening AS, followed by MSSA sepsis. The patient underwent aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the right coronary artery (RCA) on [**2168-6-9**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure due to poor ejection fraction, aortic stenosis, bacteremia/sepsis, and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). He may require assistance with inotropy and careful fluid management.
2. Critical AS: The patient has critical aortic stenosis, which has been treated with valvuloplasty. Further monitoring and management of cardiac output are necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.0 to 1.9 within the past 24 hours, suggesting acute renal failure. Contrast-induced nephropathy is a likely contributor. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
4. Sepsis: The patient had MSSA bacteremia, and surveillance cultures have shown no growth to date. Nafcillin therapy should continue for a total of 14 days,"

   Assessment and Plan
   79M with critical AS (valve area 0.5cm2), sCHF (EF 40%), alcoholic
   cirrhosis, DM, recently admitted w/ sCHF exacerbation and worsening of
   AS, later developed MSSA sepsis and now s/p aortic valvuloplasty and
   PTCA to RCA on [**2168-6-9**].
   # Hypotension:  Several contributors, including poor ejection fraction,
   aortic stenosis, bactermia/sepsis. Patient still with elevated PCWP. On
   exam, does not appear volume up, suggesting that rather than diuresis,
   patient may need assistance with ionotropy. In fact, given exam and low
   urine sodium, patient appears dehydrated (despite net positive fluid
   balance for hospital course
 does not take into account insensible
   losses). Neosynephrine was increased overnight.
   -          Decrease neosynephrine as tolerated; goal MAP>55
   -          Small fluid bolus (NS 250cc)
   # Critical AS: AS critical by valve area. Now s/p valvuloplasty [**6-9**].
   # Acute renal failure:  Creatinine increased from 1.0 to 1.9 within
   past 24 hours. Previous labs have shown a prerenal etiology. Given time
   course, likely major contributor for acute rise here contrast-induced
   nephropathy. As above, patient still does appear dry on exam, and has
   limited PO intake.
   -          Trend creatinine
   -          Urine lytes
   -          250cc bolus, as above
   -          Goal I/O net even to slightly positive
   # Sepsis:  MSSA bacteremia. Surveillance cultures no growth to date.
   Last positive blood culture was [**2168-6-7**]. TTE negative for vegetations.
   No obvious sources for bacteremia.
   -          Continue Nafcillin (GPC coverage started [**2168-6-7**]), day 5 of
   14
   -          Wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   # CAD: BMS x2 to RCA [**2168-6-9**]. Plavix loaded with 300mg PO
   -          Continue Plavix for at least 3 months
   -          Continue simvastatin, ASA
   -          Beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor held given low BP
   # PAF: Noted on admission. Cardioversion [**6-3**]. CHADS2 = 4.
   -          Continue dofetelide, renally dosed
   -          Continue heparin gtt
   -          Will need to discuss with patient his preference on starting
   heparin
   -          Continue aspirin
   # Cirrhosis/ guaiac positive stools:  Documented on MRCP as well as CT
   abdomen. Likely [**2-29**] EtOH use. Last drink approx 1 year ago. Hepatitis
   panel negative for Hep A,B,C
   -          Continue PPI for ?gastritis
   # Nutrition:  Patient with poor PO intake. Concern for aspiration,
   which was confirmed with recent speech and swallow evaluation.
   -          Modified diet
   -          Encourage PO intake, Ensure shakes
   -          Speech therapy recs
   # Anxiety/Pain:  No complaints at this time. Avoiding benzodiazepenes
   given associated sedation with small doses recently.
   # Emphysema:  Continue Fluticasone-Salmeterol, tiotropium, ipratropium
   as needed
   # DM:  ISS
   # FEN:  Cardiac, diabetic diet, with modifications; replete lytes as
   needed
   # Access: PICC
   # Prophylaxis:  On heparin drip, as above; PPI IV; bowel regimen, as
   needed
   # Code- DNR/I

   CCU Attending note.
   I have reviewed the progress note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for [**2168-6-12**].   I
   agree with the 24 hours events documented with the note.  I was present
   during the physical examination and agree with the documented
   findings.   The assessment and plan outline our strategy over the next
   24 hours.  Today we discussed the degree of supportive efforts that Mr.
   [**Known lastname 6286**] would prefer in the event of the need for dialysis (temporally)
   for the acute renal failure.   We will also continue volume repletion
   and dobutamine-dopamine combination for chronotropic and ionotropic
   support in lieu of Levophed.  We will discuss further options with the
   patient and his family related to his rehabilitation when his condition
   stabilizes.   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3051**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6109**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6129**]
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis (AS), systolic heart failure (sCHF), alcoholic cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus. The patient was admitted with an exacerbation of sCHF and worsening AS. He later developed methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis and underwent an aortic valvuloplasty and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to the right coronary artery (RCA) on [**2168-6-9**].

The patient continues to experience hypotension, likely due to poor ejection fraction, aortic stenosis, bacteremia/sepsis, and dehydration. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 1.9 within the past 24 hours, possibly due to contrast-induced nephropathy. The patient also has MSSA bacteremia, which is being treated with nafcillin. The patient has coronary artery disease with stenting to the RCA and atrial fibrillation with a CHADS2 score of 4.

The patient's cirrhosis and guaiac-positive stools are being managed, along with his poor oral intake and risk of aspiration. The patient's anxiety, pain, emphysema, diabetes, and nutritional needs are also being addressed. The patient's code status is D"
