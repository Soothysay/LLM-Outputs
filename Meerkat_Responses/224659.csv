   #: Hypoxia Resp Failure: Pt initially managed on facemask from baseline
   room air. Only focal sign on physical exam is decreased breath sounds
   at the right base. Differential included RML, RLL collapse secondary to
   mass, post-obstructive PNA, COPD Exacerbation, less likely PE.  Patient
   electively intubated yesterday for bronch/biopsy of mediastinal mass.
   Unable to traverse right main stem, bronchial washings performed
   instead.  Hypoxemia worsened post-procedure likely [**1-14**] to dead space,
   improved with sedation and positioning patient on left side to improve
   V/Q matching in right lung.  Mildly febrile this A.M. with elevated but
   decreasing white count, post-obstructive pneumonia on differential,
   will consider treatment today.

   # Hypotension: Episode likely [**1-14**] sedation.  Positive pressure may also
   have obstructed venous return in setting of slight hypovolemia at
   baseline.  Improving with volume, neo.
   - pt likely now adequately repleted, plan to wean neo as tolerated
   - pt may need central access, currently midline only
   .
   # Mediastinal Mass: Differential includes a small-cell, lymphoma,
   non-small cell CA.
   - plan for rigid bronch in OR for biopsy with possible stent
   placement/debridement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a new right lung mass and right middle lobe, right lower lobe collapse. The differential diagnosis includes right lung mass causing collapse, post-obstructive pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and less likely pulmonary embolism. The patient was electively intubated for bronchoscopy and biopsy of the mediastinal mass, but unable to traverse the right mainstem bronchus. Bronchial washings were performed instead. Hypoxemia worsened post-procedure, likely due to dead space, and improved with sedation and positioning the patient on the left side. The patient is mildly febrile this morning with an elevated but decreasing white count, and post-obstructive pneumonia is on the differential. Levofloxacin was received in the emergency department, and antibiotics may be deferred for now. The plan for transfer to the hospital ward for open lung biopsy of the mediastinal mass is being made. The patient will continue on CPAP, sedation, and weaning of FiO2 as tolerated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate a potential complication of respiratory failure. It is crucial to monitor and manage the patient's oxygenation status closely.
2. Right lung mass causing collapse: The presence of a large heterogeneously enhancing right hilar"

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The initial differential diagnosis included right middle lobe and lower lobe collapse secondary to a lung mass, post-obstructive pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and less likely pulmonary embolism. The patient was electively intubated for a bronchoscopy and biopsy of the mediastinal mass, but the right mainstem bronchus could not be traversed. Bronchial washings were performed instead. 

Post-procedure, the patient's hypoxemia worsened, likely due to dead space ventilation, and improved with sedation and positioning on the left side to improve V/Q matching in the left lung. The patient is febrile with an elevated white count, and post-obstructive pneumonia is on the differential. Treatment will be initiated today.

The patient has a large A-a gradient, suggesting intra-pulmonic shunt physiology contributing to V/Q mismatch, possibly extra-pulmonic shunt such as patent foramen ovale. 

The patient experienced an episode of hypotension likely due to sedation and positive pressure ventilation, which may have obstructed venous return in the setting of slight hypovolemia at baseline. The patient is stable with neosynephrine, although urine output (UOP) is not fluid responsive. The patient is likely now adequately repleted, and a central line will be placed,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. He has a new right lung mass and multi lumen, which may indicate a mediastinal mass. The patient underwent bronchoscopic evaluation and biopsy of the mediastinal mass, but was unable to traverse the right main stem bronchus. Bronchial washings were performed instead. Post-procedure, the patient experienced worsening hypoxemia likely due to a large intra-pulmonic shunt. He was positioned on his left side to improve ventilation-perfusion matching in the left lung. The patient is febrile with an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible post-obstructive pneumonia. He is currently being treated empirically with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. The patient has a large A-a gradient, indicating intra-pulmonic shunt physiology contributing to V/Q mismatch. There is also a possibility of an extra-pulmonic shunt, such as a patent foramen ovale (PFO).

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory failure and the presence of a large intra-pulmonic shunt can lead to inadequate oxygenation of the blood.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of acute hypoxic respiratory failure indicates a potential risk for further deterioration in respiratory function.
3. Post-obstructive pneumonia: The presence of a medi"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a new right lung mass and multi-lumen involvement. 

The patient was electively intubated for bronchoscopic evaluation and biopsy of the mediastinal mass. However, the procedure resulted in complete collapse of the right lung due to occlusion of the nearly occluded right main stem bronchus. This led to worsening hypoxemia, likely due to a large intra-pulmonic shunt. The patient's condition improved with sedation and positioning on the left side to improve ventilation-perfusion matching in the left lung.

The patient continues to be febrile with an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible post-obstructive pneumonia on the differential. Empiric antibiotic treatment is being continued.

The patient also has a large A-a gradient, indicating an extra-pulmonic shunt, possibly a patent foramen ovale (PFO).

Additionally, the patient experienced an episode of hypotension likely related to sedation and positive pressure ventilation, leading to obstructed venous return. The patient's intravascular volume was found to be slightly low, and central venous pressure was measured at 8 mmHg.

The patient has a mediastinal mass, with differentials including small-cell lung cancer, lymphoma, or non-small cell carcinoma. Emergent radiation therapy (XRT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. He has a new right lung mass and right middle lobe (RML) and right lower lobe (RLL) collapse. The patient was electively intubated for a bronchoscopic evaluation of the mediastinal mass. Post-procedure, the patient experienced worsening hypoxemia due to a large intra-pulmonic shunt, which improved with sedation and positioning on the left side. The patient remains febrile with an elevated white count, and there is a suspicion of post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a large A-a gradient and likely intra-pulmonic shunt physiology contributing to V/Q mismatch. There is also a question of an extra-pulmonic shunt, such as a patent foramen ovale (PFO).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to the right lung collapse and the large intra-pulmonic shunt.
2. Post-obstructive Pneumonia: The patient's elevated white count and fever suggest the possibility of post-obstructive pneumonia.
3. Contrast-induced Nephropathy: The patient received contrast dye recently, which could potentially lead to contrast-induced nephropathy.
4. Venous Return Obstruction: Positive pressure ventilation may have obstructed venous return in the setting of slight hypovolem"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 102-year-old male with a chief complaint of mediastinal mass. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, hypoxemia, and altered mental status. On physical examination, the patient has clear breath sounds on the left chest and diminished breath sounds on the right chest. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and altered mental status suggest potential respiratory failure due to the mediastinal mass compressing the airways or other respiratory structures.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory culture results showing gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods may indicate pneumonia, which can be a common complication in critically ill patients.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and hypoxemia increase the risk of developing DVT.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction.
7. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and flipped T waves on ECG indicate potential arrhythmias, which can be exacerbated by the patient's critical condition.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

   post-obstructive PNA, COPD Exacerbation, less likely PE.  Patient
   electively intubated yesterday for bronch/biopsy of mediastinal mass.
   Unable to traverse right main stem, bronchial washings performed
   instead.  Hypoxemia worsened post-procedure likely [**1-14**] to dead space,
   improved with sedation and positioning patient on left side to improve
   V/Q matching in left lung.  Febrile this A.M. with elevated  white
   count, post-obstructive pneumonia on differential, will begin treatment
   today.  Patient has large A-A gradient, likely intra-pulmonic shunt
   physiology contributing to V/Q mismatch, ? extra-pulmonic shunt e.g.
   PFO.
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium PRN
   - will treat empirically with vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin
   - will cont CPAP to avoid auto-PEEP in left lung and subsequent
   re-distribution of perfusion to non-ventilated right lung
   - TTE to eval for ASD, overall systolic function
   .
   # Hypotension: Episode likely [**1-14**] sedation.  Positive pressure may also
   have obstructed venous return in setting of slight hypovolemia at
   baseline.  Stable with neo, although UOP not fluid responsive.
   - pt likely now adequately repleted
   - will place central line, switch neo to levo given inappropriate HR
   response
   - continue volume replacement, titrating to UOP > 30 cc/hr
   .
   # Mediastinal Mass: Differential includes a small-cell, lymphoma,
   non-small cell CA.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a new right lung mass and right middle lobe (RML), right lower lobe (RLL) collapse. 

The patient was initially managed on a face mask from baseline room air and was electively intubated for a bronchoscopic evaluation and biopsy of the mediastinal mass. After the procedure, the patient's hypoxemia worsened, likely due to dead space ventilation, but improved with sedation and positioning on the left side to improve ventilation-perfusion matching in the left lung. 

The patient developed fevers and an elevated white count, suggesting a possible post-obstructive pneumonia, for which treatment was initiated today. The patient also has a large A-a gradient, indicating intra-pulmonic shunt physiology contributing to V/Q mismatch, possibly an extra-pulmonic shunt such as a patent foramen ovale (PFO).

The patient's hypotension is likely due to sedation and positive pressure, which may have obstructed venous return in the setting of slight hypovolemia at baseline. The patient is stable with normal saline (neo), but urine output is not fluid responsive. 

The patient has a mediastinal mass, with differential diagnoses including small-cell lung cancer, lymphoma, and non-small cell carcinoma. Emergent radiation therapy (XRT)"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a new right lung mass and right middle lobe collapse. The patient was electively intubated for a bronchoscopic biopsy of the mediastinal mass, but unable to traverse the right mainstem, bronchial washings were performed instead. Subsequently, there was occlusion of the nearly occluded right mainstem, resulting in complete collapse of the right lung. Hypoxemia worsened post-procedure, likely due to a large intra-pulmonic shunt. The patient's condition improved with sedation and positioning on the left side to improve V/Q matching in the left lung.

The patient continues to be febrile with an elevated white count, and post-obstructive pneumonia is considered. She is on empirical treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin. The patient has a large A-a gradient, likely intra-pulmonic shunt physiology contributing to V/Q mismatch.

The patient's other medical issues include hypotension, possibly exacerbated by positive pressure ventilation and slight hypovolemia at baseline. There is also a mediastinal mass, with differentials including small-cell lung cancer, lymphoma, or non-small cell carcinoma. The patient is planned for radiation therapy today and will follow up on cytology results from bronchoscopy and brushing.

The patient received adequate fluid resuscitation"

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has a new right lung mass and right middle lobe collapse. The patient was electively intubated for a bronchoscopic biopsy of the mediastinal mass. Subsequently, there was occlusion of the right mainstem bronchus, leading to complete collapse of the right lung. Hypoxemia worsened after the procedure, likely due to a large intrapulmonic shunt. The patient's condition improved with sedation and positioning on the left side to improve ventilation-perfusion matching in the left lung. The patient continues to be febrile with elevated white count, and post-obstructive pneumonia is being considered. Empiric treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin is being administered. The patient has a large A-a gradient, indicating intra-pulmonic shunt physiology contributing to ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Albuterol and ipratropium are being administered as needed. CPAP is being continued to avoid auto-PEEP in the left lung and subsequent redistribution of perfusion to the non-ventilated right lung. A transthoracic echo (TTE) showed no evidence of extrapulmonic shunt.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She underwent elective intubation for bronchoscopic biopsy of a mediastinal mass, but the procedure resulted in occlusion of the right main stem bronchus and subsequent collapse of the right lung. The patient's hypoxemia worsened post-procedure but improved with sedation and positioning on the left side.

The patient has been diagnosed with a mediastinal mass, with differential diagnoses including small-cell or non-small cell carcinoma. Cytology samples have been non-diagnostic, so further tissue diagnosis is needed. The patient received massive doses of radiation therapy yesterday, with plans for once weekly treatment.

The patient also has fever and leukocytosis, likely secondary to post-obstructive pneumonia. Empirical antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and the patient is being closely monitored for any signs of sepsis or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Additionally, the patient is experiencing hypotension, which was initially thought to be related to AF with right ventricular failure. However, rate control has been achieved, and the patient is now on stress dose steroids. Despite this, the patient remains hypotensive. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal any evidence of systolic dysfunction or pericardial effusion.

The patient's poor urine output has improved"

   #: Hypoxic Resp Failure:  Patient electively intubated for
   bronch/biopsy of mediastinal mass.  Unable to traverse right main stem,
   bronchial washings performed instead.  Subsequent occlusion of nearly
   occluded right-main stem, with complete collapse of right lung.
   Hypoxemia worsened post-procedure likely [**1-14**] to large intra-pulmonic
   shunt or severe V/Q mismatch, improved with sedation and positioning
   patient on left side to improve V/Q matching in left lung.  Now with
   likely post-obstructive pneumonia, improving in terms of fevers and
   white count today.
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She underwent a bronchoscopic procedure that resulted in complete collapse of the right lung, worsening hypoxemia due to a large intrapulmonic shunt or severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch. The patient is currently on CPAP to avoid auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP) in the left lung and improve V/Q matching. She also received radiation therapy (XRT) yesterday for a mediastinal mass, which could potentially be small-cell lung cancer, lymphoma, or non-small cell carcinoma. The cytology samples have been non-diagnostic so far. The patient has been febrile and leukocytosis but is currently afebrile. Her blood pressure is stable with the use of norepinephrine, and she is being monitored for potential causes of hypotension such as sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or right heart failure. The patient has poor urine output, and her serum sodium levels suggest pre-renal physiology. There are diffuse T-wave inversions on her electrocardiogram, which may be related to hypoxemia. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm on amiodarone. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she is expected to remain in the ICU."

   AFIB
   ====================
   Continues to have high oxygen requirement with right lung atelectasis.
   At bronch, the right mainstem was not totally occluded; it's possible
   that there is atelectasis that might respond to recruitment maneuvers.
   Patient tolerated a 40 second maneuver but dropped BP with PEEP 10.
   Need to check CVP to see if she is relatively volume depeleted. She
   appears to be acting as if she has sepsis from pneumonia. If CVP low,
   give additional fluids and try additional recruitment maneuver with
   subsequent increase in PEEP to 10. If BP does not respond to fluids,
   would add vasopressin.
   Afib well controlled with amiodarone.
   XRT continues for lung ca/mass.
   Hct stable. No evidence for bleeding. Not at transfusion threshold.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's high oxygen requirement indicates respiratory distress and failure, likely due to pneumonia and atelectasis in the right lung.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which may be related to sepsis from pneumonia or volume depletion.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, which is well controlled with amiodarone.

4. Lung cancer/mass: The patient is receiving XRT (radiation therapy) for lung cancer/mass.

5. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms suggest a bacterial infection in the lungs, leading to pneumonia.

6. Atelectasis: The right lung atelectasis may be causing difficulty in oxygenation and ventilation.

7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility in the ICU.

8. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness.

9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to endotracheal intubation.

10. Sepsis: The patient appears to be acting as if she has sepsis from pneumonia.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to improve the"

   Assessment and Plan
   65F with hx of AF presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of new right lung mass and RML, RLL collapse.
   .
   #: Hypoxic Resp Failure:  Patient electively intubated for
   bronch/biopsy of mediastinal mass.  Unable to traverse right main stem,
   bronchial washings performed instead.  Subsequent occlusion of nearly
   occluded right-main stem, with complete collapse of right lung.
   Hypoxemia worsened post-procedure likely [**1-14**] to large intra-pulmonic
   shunt or severe V/Q mismatch, improved with sedation and positioning
   patient on left side to improve V/Q matching in left lung.  Now with
   likely post-obstructive pneumonia, improving in terms of fevers and
   white count today.  TTE
 (-) for extrapulmonic shunt.  Desaturation
   overnight possible [**1-14**] mucous plugging.
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium PRN
   - will cont ot treat empirically with vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin,
   Flagyl
   - wean FiO2 to limit oxygen toxicity
   - weekly XRT to shrink mass and hopefuly allow reexpansion

   # Mediastinal Mass: Differential includes a small-cell or non-small
   cell CA, possible squamous cell. Cytology samples have been
   non-diagnostic. Had XRTon [**2126-12-20**].
   - weekly XRT
   - check tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - will need definitive tissue diagnosis if patient stabilizes, consider
   repeat cytology vs. plan for bx if XRT allows improvement in stability
   .
   #Fever/Leukocytosis:
   Likely septic from post- Obstructive PNA. Afebrile x 48 hours and
   leukocytosis stabilized. No organism identified.
   - continue empiric ABX as above for VAP course
   -f/u cx, CIS
   -tylenol PRN to treat fevers

   # Hypotension:  Initially thought to be [**1-14**] AFIB with RVR, adrenal
   insufficiency.  Now rate controlled and on stress dose steriods, but
   still hypotensive. On Levo.  TTE with no evidence of systolic
   dysfunction or pericardial effusion.
   - cont IVF boluses PRN to maintain mean BP > 65, UOP > 30 cc/hr; if no
   response to boluses, favor restarting levophed
   - monitor CVP

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of a new right lung mass and right middle lobe collapse. She was electively intubated for bronchoscopic biopsy of the mediastinal mass. Post-procedure, there was occlusion of the nearly occluded right main stem bronchus, leading to complete collapse of the right lung and worsening hypoxemia. This was likely due to a large intrapulmonic shunt or severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch. The patient's hypoxemia improved with sedation, positioning on the left side, and administration of breaths by bagging to relieve auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (autoPEEP). 

The patient has been treated empirically with vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for post-obstructive pneumonia. FiO2 was weaned to limit oxygen toxicity. The patient received weekly X-ray therapy to shrink the mediastinal mass and hopefully allow reexpansion of the collapsed lung. 

Other issues include fever and leukocytosis, likely secondary to sepsis from post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is afebrile for 48 hours, and leukocytosis has stabilized. No organism has been identified, and the patient is being continued on empirical antibiotic therapy. 

The patient also has hypotension, initially thought to be due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of a new right lung mass and right middle lobe collapse. The patient was electively intubated for bronchoscopic biopsy of the mediastinal mass, but was unable to traverse the right main stem bronchus, so bronchial washings were performed instead. Subsequent occlusion of the nearly occluded right main stem bronchus resulted in complete collapse of the right lung, leading to worsening hypoxemia likely due to a large intrapulmonic shunt or severe V/Q mismatch. The patient's condition improved with sedation and positioning on the left side to improve V/Q matching in the left lung. The patient now has likely post-obstructive pneumonia, which is improving in terms of fevers and white count today. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed and did not show evidence of extrapulmonic shunt. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of acute hypoxic respiratory failure required elective intubation for bronchoscopic biopsy of the mediastinal mass. This complication can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation if not managed properly.
2. Right lung collapse: The occlusion of the nearly occluded right main stem bronchus during the bronchoscopic procedure resulted in complete collapse of"

   24 Hour Events:
   - low UOP, CVP 3-5, received IVF boluses prn
   - recruitment maneuvers not helpful
   - tumor lysis labs ok
   - desat to 70s, nothing seemed to help (suctioned, turned on left,
   tried gentle recruitment techniques, gave breaths by bagging to relieve
   autoPEEP), eventually improved to high 80s. We called in [**Doctor First Name 760**] and
   another friend, and they left when things stabilized. They would want
   to be called again if nothing similar were to happen and things not
   turning around quickly. We discussed that CPR was indicated and [**Doctor First Name 760**]
   agrees with our best judgement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and has a mediastinal mass. The patient's condition is being managed in the ICU with various interventions including mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and sedation.

The patient has shown episodes of low urine output (UOP) and low central venous pressure (CVP), which have required intravenous fluid (IVF) boluses. Recruitment maneuvers have not been effective in improving oxygenation. Tumor lysis syndrome labs are within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate (HR) of 57 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 110/60 to 122/60 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) set at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 86%. The patient is on sinus bradycardia.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 6,299 mL and output of 1,123 mL since 28 AM. The patient's weight has increased from 62.7 kg at admission to 71.1 kg currently.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 27.1 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) at 9.0 g/dL, normal sodium (Na+) at 138 mEq/L, slightly elevated potassium (K+) at 5.0 mg/dL, and decreased platelet count (Plt) at 621 K/uL. Other lab values, including renal function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray from December 20, 04:45 AM shows a large mediastinal mass with associated pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. Subsequent X-rays show stable findings.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring due to the potential for complications such as further respiratory deterioration, hypotension, and infection. The patient's code status is set to full code.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   =======================
   Patient's overall condition has worsened in last 12 hours. Attempts to
   reverse atelectasis in left lung not successful. Given the potential
   adverse hemodynamic consequences of inverse ratio ventilation, will go
   back to normal I/E ratio. Concern about O2 toxicity for left lung; will
   try to reduce FIO2. Monitor secretions.
   Patient continues on 2 pressors. Try to reduce levphed further today.
   Maintain CVP at 10-12.
   Urine output has decreased significantly in last few hours. No prologed
   episodes of hypotension. CVP  now 7; will try additional fluid boluses
   today. If patient continues at marked oliguric level, would consider
   lasix to try to achieve a non-oliguric renal failure to avert
   hyperkalemia and forestall dialysis.
   Is intermittently in afib today. Continue amiodarone.
   AFebrile. Continue antibiotics for presumed post-obstructive pneumonia.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions and complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of lung cancer and right lung atelectasis, which indicates a compromised respiratory function. This puts the patient at risk for further respiratory failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and may result in organ damage or failure if not managed appropriately.

3. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia. This can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and potentially result in tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.

4. Hypoxemia: The patient has low oxygen levels in the blood, which can be caused by the underlying lung conditions and may worsen due to atelectasis or other respiratory complications.

5. Right Lung Atelectasis: The patient has right lung atelectasis, which is the collapse of a portion of the lung. This can impair gas exchange and increase the risk of pneumonia or further respiratory complications.

6. Lung Mass/Cancer: The patient has lung cancer, which can contribute to respiratory difficulties and increase the risk of complications such as infection or bleeding.

7. Urinary Output Decrease: The patient's urine output has decreased significantly, indicating possible renal impairment or acute kidney injury. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances and other complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been unable to wean off supplemental oxygen, with a current FiO2 set at 80%. There is evidence of hypovolemia, as indicated by a urine sodium level less than 10, central venous pressure (CVP) between 6-8 mmHg, and poor urine output response to intravenous fluids (IVF) alone, which improved with the addition of levo and continued vasopressin. The patient's urine output is described as suboptimal.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 53 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 110/75 to 91/62 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 86%. The patient's weight has increased from 62.7 kg at admission to 78 kg currently.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 5,482 mL and total output of 819 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,663 mL. The patient's CVP is within the desired range of 4-12 mmHg.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode with assist and autoflow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, set RR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She underwent a bronchoscopic procedure which resulted in the occlusion of the right mainstem bronchus and subsequent collapse of the right lung. The patient's hypoxemia worsened after the procedure, likely due to a large intrapulmonic shunt or severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch. She has been positioned on her left side to improve ventilation-perfusion matching in the left lung. The patient is currently requiring a significant amount of support to maintain oxygen saturation levels in the mid-80s. She has been treated empirically with vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for suspected post-obstructive pneumonia. Weekly radiation therapy has been planned to shrink the mediastinal mass and hopefully allow for lung re-expansion. The patient's fever and leukocytosis have stabilized, and no organism has been identified. She remains hypotensive despite rate control and stress dose steroids for suspected adrenal insufficiency. The patient's poor urine output has not responded to intravenous fluids, and she is receiving vasopressin. Diffuse T wave inversions on electrocardiogram are likely due to hypoxemia. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm on amiodarone."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She was intubated for a bronchoscopic procedure to examine a mediastinal mass and right lung collapse. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 set at 80% due to hypoxemia, which improved with sedation and positioning on the left side. She now requires near maximal ventilatory support to maintain marginal oxygenation. The patient has been treated empirically with antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and Flagyl. A mediastinal mass is suspected to be either small-cell or non-small cell carcinoma. The patient has received weekly radiation therapy and requires definitive tissue diagnosis if she stabilizes. She has also experienced fever and leukocytosis likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia, for which she is being treated with antibiotics. The patient's blood pressure remains low despite stress-dose steroids and vasopressin, and she continues to have poor urine output. T wave inversions on the ECG are non-specific and may be related to hypoxemia. The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently in sinus rhythm on amiodarone."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated in the ICU. There have been several events over the past 24 hours, including attempts to wean FiO2 to limit O2 toxicity, urine sodium levels indicating hypovolemia, and poor urine output response to intravenous fluids. The patient is requiring a significant amount of support to maintain oxygen saturation in the mid-80s.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating between 110/75 mmHg and 82/50 mmHg.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is consistently below normal levels, currently at 86%.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation to assist with breathing.
4. Possible Hypovolemia: Urine sodium levels are low, central venous pressure is within normal range, and there has been inadequate urine output in response to intravenous fluids.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Elevated serum creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function.
6. Infection: No specific infection has been identified yet, but further investigation is needed due to the prolonged hospital stay.
7. Potential for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in the legs due to immobility and central venous"

   Assessment and Plan
   65F with hx of AF presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of new right lung mass and RML, RLL collapse.
   .
   #: Hypoxic Resp Failure:  Patient electively intubated for
   bronch/biopsy of mediastinal mass.  Unable to traverse right main stem,
   bronchial washings performed instead.  Subsequent occlusion of nearly
   occluded right-main stem, with complete collapse of right lung.
   Hypoxemia worsened post-procedure likely [**1-14**] to large intra-pulmonic
   shunt or severe V/Q mismatch, improved with sedation and positioning
   patient on left side to improve V/Q matching in left lung.  Now with
   likely post-obstructive pneumonia, improving in terms of fevers and
   white count today.  TTE
 (-) for extrapulmonic shunt.  Desaturation
   overnight possible [**1-14**] mucous plugging.
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium PRN
   - will cont ot treat empirically with vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin,
   Flagyl
   - wean FiO2 to limit oxygen toxicity
   - weekly XRT to shrink mass and hopefuly allow reexpansion

   # Mediastinal Mass: Differential includes a small-cell or non-small
   cell CA, possible squamous cell. Cytology samples have been
   non-diagnostic. Had XRTon [**2126-12-20**].
   - weekly XRT
   - check tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - will need definitive tissue diagnosis if patient stabilizes, consider
   repeat cytology vs. plan for bx if XRT allows improvement in stability
   .
   #Fever/Leukocytosis:
   Likely septic from post- Obstructive PNA. Afebrile x 48 hours and
   leukocytosis stabilized. No organism identified.
   - continue empiric ABX as above for VAP course
   -f/u cx, CIS
   -tylenol PRN to treat fevers
   .
   # Hypotension:  Initially thought to be [**1-14**] AFIB with RVR, adrenal
   insufficiency.  Now rate controlled and on stress dose steriods, but
   still hypotensive. On Levo.  TTE with no evidence of systolic
   dysfunction or pericardial effusion.
   - cont IVF boluses PRN to maintain mean BP > 65, UOP > 30 cc/hr; if no
   response to boluses, favor restarting levophed
   - monitor CVP
   - will continute vasopressin

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She was intubated for a bronchoscopic procedure to evaluate a new right lung mass and right middle lobe (RML), right lower lobe (RLL) collapse. The procedure resulted in worsening hypoxemia due to a large intrapulmonic shunt or severe ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. The patient's condition improved with sedation and positioning on the left side. Currently, she is still requiring a significant amount of support to maintain oxygen saturation in the mid-80s. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which led to elective intubation. The respiratory failure was caused by the occlusion of the nearly occluded right main stem bronchus during the bronchoscopic procedure, resulting in complete collapse of the right lung. This event worsened the patient's hypoxemia, likely due to a large intrapulmonic shunt or severe V/Q mismatch. The patient's oxygenation improved with sedation and positioning on the left side to improve V/Q matching in the left lung.

2. Post-obstructive Pneumonia (PON): The patient has likely developed post-obstructive pneumonia due to the right lung collapse. This condition is indicated by improving fevers and white blood cell count. The patient"

   #: Hypoxic Resp Failure:  Patient electively intubated for
   bronch/biopsy of mediastinal mass.  Unable to traverse right main stem,
   bronchial washings, then brushing, then biopsy perfomed on sequential
   bronchs.  Subsequent occlusion of nearly occluded right-main stem, with
   complete collapse of right lung.  Hypoxemia worsened post-procedure
   likely [**1-14**] to large intra-pulmonic shunt or severe V/Q mismatch,
   improved with sedation and positioning patient on left side to improve
   V/Q matching in left lung.  Now with likely post-obstructive pneumonia,
   improving in terms of fevers and white count today.  TTE
 (-) for
   extrapulmonic shunt.  No significant changes, continues to require near
   maximal ventilatory support to maintain marginal oxygenation.

   - will need definitive tissue diagnosis if patient stabilizes, consider
   repeat cytology vs. plan for bx if XRT allows improvement in stability
   -> will discuss with Rad Onc re: response to XRT

   #Fever/Leukocytosis:
   Likely septic from post- Obstructive PNA. Afebrile x 72 hours and
   leukocytosis stabilized. No organism identified.

   insufficiency.  Now rate controlled and on stress dose steriods, but
   still hypotensive. On Levo.  TTE with no evidence of systolic
   dysfunction or pericardial effusion.  Poor urine response to IVF bolues

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of a new right lung mass and right middle lobe collapse. The patient underwent an elective intubation for bronchoscopic biopsy of a mediastinal mass. However, during the procedure, there was occlusion of nearly occluded right main stem, leading to complete collapse of the right lung. This resulted in worsening hypoxemia, likely due to a large intrapulmonic shunt or severe V/Q mismatch. The patient's oxygenation improved with sedation and positioning on the left side to improve V/Q matching in the left lung.

The patient is currently experiencing likely post-obstructive pneumonia, improving in terms of fevers and white count. A transthoracic echo (TTE) was performed, which did not show any significant changes and continues to require near maximal ventilatory support to maintain marginal oxygenation.

The assessment and plan include several conditions: Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, Mediastinal Mass, Fever/Leukocytosis, Hypotension, Poor UOP, and T wave inversions. 

For Hypoxic Respiratory Failure, the patient is being treated with Albuterol/Ipratropium PRN, continuous treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for post-obstructive pneumonia. The FiO2 is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She has a new right lung mass and right middle lobe collapse. The patient was intubated for a bronchoscopic biopsy of the mediastinal mass, but unable to traverse the right main stem bronchus. Bronchoscopic washings, brushing, and biopsy were performed on sequential bronchi. Subsequent occlusion of nearly occluded right main stem resulted in complete collapse of the right lung. Hypoxemia worsened post-procedure, likely due to a large intrapulmonic shunt or severe V/Q mismatch, which improved with sedation and positioning the patient on the left side to improve V/Q matching in the left lung. The patient now has likely post-obstructive pneumonia, improving in terms of fevers and white count today. A transthoracic echo (TTE) showed no evidence of extrapulmonic shunt. The patient requires near maximal ventilatory support to maintain marginal oxygenation.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a large intrapulmonic shunt or severe V/Q mismatch caused by the right lung collapse. This has led to the need for mechanical ventilation and near maximal ventilatory support.
2. Post-obstructive Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia likely due to the obstruction of the bronchus by the medi"

   #: Hypoxic Resp Failure:  Patient electively intubated for
   bronch/biopsy of mediastinal mass.  Unable to traverse right main stem,
   bronchial washings, then brushing, then biopsy perfomed on sequential
   bronchs.  Subsequent occlusion of nearly occluded right-main stem, with
   complete collapse of right lung.  Hypoxemia worsened post-procedure
   likely [**1-14**] to large intra-pulmonic shunt or severe V/Q mismatch,
   improved with sedation and positioning patient on left side to improve
   V/Q matching in left lung.  Now with likely post-obstructive
   pneumonia.  TTE  (-) for extrapulmonic shunt.  No significant changes,
   continues to require near maximal ventilatory support to maintain
   marginal oxygenation.  She received high dose XRT with no response. We
   have been unable to make tissue dx, but squamous cell likely. At this
   point she appears to be a treatment failure and discussion with HCP
   yesterday will likely lead to CMO.
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium PRN
   - will cont ot treat empirically with vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin,
   Flagyl for post obstructive PNA
   - discuss extubation and CMO with HCP today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She underwent a bronchoscopic procedure that led to the complete collapse of her right lung due to occlusion of the right main stem bronchus. This resulted in severe hypoxemia, which improved with sedation and positioning on the left side.

The patient received high-dose radiation therapy (XRT) with no response and has been unable to make tissue diagnosis, with squamous cell carcinoma likely. She appears to be a treatment failure and is being discussed for compassionate use of chemotherapy (CMO).

The patient also has a fever and leukocytosis, which is likely due to post-obstructive pneumonia. She is being treated empirically with antibiotics (Vanc, Cefepime, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl) for this condition.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing hypotension, possibly due to sepsis or adrenal insufficiency. Her mean blood pressure is being targeted at more than 65 mmHg, and she is on norepinephrine (Levophed).

There are also T-wave inversions on the electrocardiogram (ECG), which do not correspond to any specific territory and may be related to hypoxemia. Cardiac enzymes are negative.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is being treated with amiodarone.

Overall, the patient's medical complications include hypoxic respiratory failure, post-obstructive pneumonia, hypotension (possibly due to sepsis or adrenal insufficiency), and atrial fibrillation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She underwent an elective intubation for bronchoscopic evaluation of a mediastinal mass, but the procedure caused complete collapse of her right lung. The patient's hypoxemia worsened post-procedure and she required near maximal ventilatory support to maintain marginal oxygenation. She has been diagnosed with a likely post-obstructive pneumonia and has not responded to high-dose XRT. The patient appears to be a treatment failure and a discussion with healthcare professionals yesterday will likely lead to compassionate extubation and care management. She also has fever and leukocytosis, possibly due to septicemia from post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is being treated for adrenal insufficiency without much improvement in pressures. Her blood pressure is low, and she has poor urine response to intravenous fluid boluses. She is on norepinephrine. The patient has diffuse T wave inversions on ECG, which may be related to hypoxemia. She is currently in atrial fibrillation and is being treated with amiodarone. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and her code status is DNR (do not resuscitate). She is currently admitted to [hospital unit name]. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent worsening of hypoxemia suggest a critical"

   Assessment and Plan
   65F with hx of AF presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of new right lung mass and RML, RLL collapse.
   .
   #: Hypoxic Resp Failure:  Patient electively intubated for
   bronch/biopsy of mediastinal mass.  Unable to traverse right main stem,
   bronchial washings, then brushing, then biopsy perfomed on sequential
   bronchs.  Subsequent occlusion of nearly occluded right-main stem, with
   complete collapse of right lung.  Hypoxemia worsened post-procedure
   likely [**1-14**] to large intra-pulmonic shunt or severe V/Q mismatch,
   improved with sedation and positioning patient on left side to improve
   V/Q matching in left lung.  Now with likely post-obstructive
   pneumonia.  TTE  (-) for extrapulmonic shunt.  No significant changes,
   continues to require near maximal ventilatory support to maintain
   marginal oxygenation.  She received high dose XRT with no response. We
   have been unable to make tissue dx, but squamous cell likely. At this
   point she appears to be a treatment failure and discussion with HCP
   yesterday will likely lead to CMO.
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium PRN
   - will cont ot treat empirically with vanc, cefepime, levofloxacin,
   Flagyl for post obstructive PNA
   - discuss extubation and CMO with HCP today
   .
   #Fever/Leukocytosis:
   Likely septic from post- Obstructive PNA. Has been afebrile for several
   days on abx. No organism identified.
   - continue empiric ABX as above for VAP course
   -f/u cx, CIS
   -tylenol PRN to treat fevers
   .
   # Hypotension:  [**1-14**] sepsis. Patient is also being treated for adrenal
   insufficiency, without much improvement in pressures.   CVP low but pt
   has poor urine response to IVF bolues. On levophed.
   - goal mean BP > 65 mmHg
   .
   # T wave inversions- diffuse inferiorly, anteriorly, and laterally,
   does not correspond to any one territory.  Likely [**1-14**] hypoxemia.  Cont
   to monitor.  Cardiac enzymes (-).
   .
   #: Atrial Fibrillation: Pt currently in AF intermittently on
   amiodarone.
   - cont amio PO load, 400 mg TID

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent an elective intubation for bronch/biopsy of a mediastinal mass, but was unable to traverse the right mainstem bronchus, leading to complete collapse of the right lung. This resulted in worsening hypoxemia, likely due to a large intrapulmonic shunt or severe V/Q mismatch.

The patient received high-dose radiation therapy (XRT) with no response and has been unable to obtain a tissue diagnosis. The most likely diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma. The patient appears to be a treatment failure and a discussion with the healthcare provider yesterday will likely lead to a compassionate medical omission (CMO).

The patient is currently being treated for post-obstructive pneumonia, fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation. She requires near maximal ventilatory support to maintain marginal oxygenation. The goal mean blood pressure is greater than 65 mmHg, and the patient is on norepinephrine.

The patient's T-wave inversions do not correspond to any one territory and may be related to hypoxemia. Cardiac enzymes are negative. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is in the critical care unit.

In the protected section of the note, it is mentioned that after further"
