   - repeat EKG
   - given blood
   # Sepsis: Significant Leukocytosis. Fever. Bilateral Pneumonia, Urinary
   tract infection. given vanc/ceftriax/azithro. Given smoking history and
   elevated LDH  concerned for post-obstructive. Will treat vanc/zosyn.
   Cipro for urinary coverage and double GNR. Image procine AVR for signs
   endocarditis. In past 5 years has had pneumonvax.
   - vanc level in am
   - CVP now >12 and septic component of her shock has improved, but
   remains with cardiogenic as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source, cardiogenic shock in the setting of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and renal failure. The patient has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a porcine valve. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/43 mmHg to 34/21 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished pulses in the extremities and cool extremities. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, troponin T, C-reactive protein, lactate, and liver enzymes, with low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient has been started on various medications including heparin, dobutamine, aspirin, statin, Plavix, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, and Zosyn. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing cardiogenic shock and septic shock components, requiring ongoing supportive care.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a porcine valve, hypertension (Htn), and diabetes mellitus (DM). She presents with sepsis from a pulmonary or urinary source, cardiogenic shock in the setting of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and renal failure.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors. She has developed severe leukocytosis, fever, bilateral pneumonia, and a urinary tract infection. She has been started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin for treatment. There is concern for post-obstructive pneumonia due to her smoking history and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Ciprofloxacin has been added for urinary coverage, and imaging of the AVR will be done to evaluate for signs of endocarditis.

The patient's cardiogenic shock has not improved despite increasing central venous pressure (CVP) above 12. She remains hypotensive and requires dopamine and norepinephrine for blood pressure support. Dobutamine has been started to improve cardiac output. Troponin levels are significantly elevated, indicating myocardial injury.

The patient is also experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia. She is on mechanical ventilation with ARDS net"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old female with past medical history significant for CAD s/p
   CABG, s/p AVR with porcine valve, HTN, DM2, presents with sepsis from
   pulmonary source, cardiogenic shock in setting of NSTEMI, acute renal
   failure, and shock liver.  The most important
   # Septic shock: Bilateral pneumonia.  Sputum/blood cultures pending.
   Appears as if patient has been fluid resucitated adequately.  Influenza
   negative.
   - Continue vancomycin (dose by level), zosyn, ciprofloxacin
   - Sputum, blood cultures pending
   - Continue vasopressin, levophed for goal MAP > 55
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   # NSTEMI: Patient appears to have primarily distributive shock at this
   time but there may be a component of cardiogenic shock.  She has known
   CAD s/p CABG in [**2194**].  Anterolateral EKG changes.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Continue hepatin gtt x 48 hours
   - TTE today
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 30
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - Holding metoprolol for hypotension, statin for liver failure
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Pneumonia/ARDS.
   - Decrease tidal volume and wean settings as tolerated
   - Antibiotics as above
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had pre-renal urine electrolytes on
   admission due to sepsis and cardiogenic shock.  She continues to be
   anuric, not responsive to fluids, and now likely has transitioned to
   acute tubular necrosis.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Goals of care discussion as above regarding initiation of CVVH
   # Anemia: Stable status post 2U PRBC to increase CvO2.  No signs or
   symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 30
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Shock liver: AST/ALT > [**2187**].
   - Hold statin
   - Continue to trend
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Mottled extremities on pressors.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Attempt to wean pressors if tolerated
   # Type 2 diabetes: Improved control with insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding statin in setting of liver failure.
   # GERD: Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **] given gastocult positive NG drainage.
   # Glaucoma: Continue timolol eye drops.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a significant medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), aortic valve replacement (AVR) with a porcine valve, hypertension (HTN), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). The patient presents with sepsis from a pulmonary source, cardiogenic shock in the setting of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute renal failure, and shock liver.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis from a pulmonary source, which requires continuous monitoring and management of vital signs, infection control measures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has known CAD and has undergone CABG. The presence of cardiogenic shock may be due to the NSTEMI. Continuous monitoring of cardiac enzymes and maintaining adequate blood pressure and cardiac output are crucial.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is anuric and not responsive to fluids, indicating acute renal failure. Renal replacement therapy, such as continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), may be necessary. Medications need to be dosed appropriately based on renal function.
4. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in hypoxemic respiratory failure. Lung protective strategies, such"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old female with past medical history significant for CAD s/p
   CABG, s/p AVR with porcine valve, Htn, DM, presents with sepsis from
   pulmonary or urinary source, cardiogenic shock in setting of NSTEMI,
   and  renal failure.
   # Septic shock: Significant Leukocytosis. Fever. Bilateral Pneumonia,
   Urinary tract infection. given vanc/ceftriax/azithro. Given smoking
   history and elevated LDH  concerned for post-obstructive. Will treat
   vanc/zosyn. Cipro for urinary coverage and double GNR. Image procine
   AVR for signs endocarditis. In past 5 years has had pneumonvax.
   - vanc level in am
   - CVP now >12 and septic component of her shock has improved, but
   remains with cardiogenic as above
   - femoral a-line, dobutamine and levophed for MAP >65
   - zosyn/cipro
   - send for flu
   - urine legionella
   - sputum, blood, urine, stool cx
   - TTE to eval EF and AVR
   - consider BAL given hypoxemia, to eval for PJP or endobronchial lesion
   with obstruction
   - hold anti-hypertensives
   # Cardiogenic Shock/ NSTEMI/ Known CAD: EKG changes. In setting of
   demand, but with signficant troponin. Mycocardial stunning from oxygen
   demand, CvO2 low, extremities are cold.
   - start heparin drip
   - on dobutamine
   - trend troponin

   - antibiotics as above
   - consider BAL as above
   # Renal Failure - hypotension in sepsis and cardiogenic. urinary lytes
   prerenal, FeNa o.2%
   - follow UOP goal 30 ml/hr
   - f/u urine culture
   - trend creatinine
   # Anemia: hx HCT 30, on admit 26-29. No obvious bleeding source. Does
   have hx of hemorrhoids. In setting of low CvO2 and cardiogenic shock
   will transfuse.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year-old female with past medical history significant for CAD s/p
   CABG, s/p porcine AVR, HTN, DM2, presents with sepsis from pulmonary
   source, cardiogenic shock in setting of NSTEMI, acute renal failure,
   and shock liver.  The patient has an increasingly grim prognosis given
   multiorgan system failure.  The most important plan for today is to
   readdress goals of care with the patient
s family.
   # Septic shock: Bilateral pneumonia.  Sputum/blood cultures pending.
   Appears as if patient has been fluid resucitated adequately now with
   CVP 15-17, no respiratory variation.  Influenza negative.
   - Continue vancomycin (dose by level), zosyn, ciprofloxacin
   - Sputum, blood cultures pending
   - Continue vasopressin, levophed for goal MAP > 55
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   # NSTEMI: Patient appears to have primarily distributive shock at this
   time but there may be a component of cardiogenic shock.  She has known
   CAD s/p CABG in [**2194**].  Anterolateral EKG changes.  CK has peaked,
   however, troponin T continues to rise.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Continue hepatin gtt x 48 hours
   - TTE today
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 30
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - Holding metoprolol for hypotension and holding statin for liver
   failure
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Pneumonia/ARDS.
   - Decrease tidal volume and wean settings as tolerated
   - Antibiotics as above
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had pre-renal urine electrolytes on
   admission due to sepsis +/- cardiogenic shock.  She continues to be
   anuric, not responsive to fluids, and now likely has transitioned to
   acute tubular necrosis.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Start bicarbonate gtt
   - Goals of care discussion as above regarding initiation of CVVH
   # Anemia: Stable > 30 status post 2U PRBC to increase CvO2.  No signs
   or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 30
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Shock liver: AST/ALT > [**2187**].
   - Hold statin
   - Continue to trend
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Mottled extremities on pressors.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Attempt to wean pressors if tolerated
   # Type 2 diabetes: Improved control with insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding statin in setting of liver failure
   # GERD: Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **] given gastocult positive NG drainage
   # Glaucoma: Continue timolol eye drops

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and received a porcine aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presents with sepsis from a pulmonary source, cardiogenic shock in the setting of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), acute renal failure, and shock liver. 

The patient's current medical complications include septic shock, NSTEMI, hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia, shock liver, and peripheral vascular disease. 

The plan for today includes readdressing goals of care with the patient's family. The patient is already on multiple medications including vancomycin, zosyn, ciprofloxacin, vasopressin, levophed, aspirin, plavix, hepatin gtt, and insulin gtt. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. Her electrolytes are imbalanced, with low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient also has a history of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and glaucoma.

Overall, the patient's prognosis is grim due to multiorgan system failure. The most important plan is to continue addressing her sepsis, NSTEMI, and other complications while discussing goals of care with the family."

   72 year old woman p/w pneumonia, septic shock, and NSTEMI. Now with
   shock liver and progressive acute renal failure. Prognosis is
   increasingly grim.
   High dose pressors despite adequate volume resuscitation(CVP 15, no
   pulse pressure variation). Worsening metabolic acidosis will speak with
   family today about RRT and possibly consult renal. Troponins still
   increasing but no utility to cardiac intervention. Will check TTE today
   but appears to be in primarily distributive shock at this point.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, and currently presenting with septic shock, pneumonia, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure and shock.

24-hour events include a change in code status to do not resuscitate (DNR), transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), initiation of vasopressin, and ongoing use of levo. Allergies are noted, as well as the last doses of antibiotics given.

The patient is currently on multiple infusions including fentanyl, midazolam (versed), vasopressin, insulin, heparin sodium, and norepinephrine. Other ICU medications include midazolam and fentanyl, which were started on the previous day, along with pantoprazole (Protonix) initiated on the current day.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 40.6Â°C (105Â°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/45 mmHg to 118/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 34%. The patient is in sinus tachycardia and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg. Fluid balance indicates an intake"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old woman with a medical history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, and currently presenting with septic shock, pneumonia, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

The patient has experienced several medical complications including respiratory failure, shock, and acute kidney injury. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury. 

Her vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated body temperature. She also has a high respiratory rate and low oxygen saturation. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and worsening renal function. Cardiac biomarkers are elevated, suggesting ongoing myocardial injury. Liver enzymes are also elevated, indicating liver dysfunction. 

The patient has been receiving high-dose vasopressors to maintain blood pressure despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Metabolic acidosis is progressing, and the prognosis is described as increasingly grim. 

Further plans include discussing renal replacement therapy (RRT) with the family and consulting a nephrologist. The patient's condition appears to be primarily distributive shock, and any potential cardiac intervention may not be beneficial at this point. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving insulin infusion for glycemic control, and has multiple lines including an arterial line. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis prevention,"
