   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support but
   hypotensive with R hip hematoma.
   #. Hypotension: Most likely from bleed and possibly from poor forward
   flow and decompensated heart failure.  Improved last 24 hours with SBPs
   100s after transfusion 2 units PRBC. HCT now stable with inadequate
   bump 21.9->25 but stable x 12 hours. Has tolerated diuresis as well
   with lasix to keep net negative.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated CK levels, indicating ongoing ischemia. The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR) that is likely ischemic in nature, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He has a hip hematoma and is hypotensive. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to bleeding and poor forward flow caused by decompensated heart failure. It has improved with blood transfusion, but careful monitoring and continued use of diuretics are necessary.
2. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia secondary to blood loss and possible hemolysis. Anticoagulation should be stopped, and folic acid supplementation should be given. Daily hemolysis labs should be monitored.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to anemia. It improved after blood transfusion.
4. R hip hematoma: The hematoma may be the source of anemia. Serial exams should monitor for foot drop, and ortho intervention should be considered if sciatic nerve impingement occurs.
5. CAD/NSTEMI: The patient had a revascularization procedure with Cypher stents to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level of 1516 (rising), and the left circumflex artery (LCx) was identified as the likely culprit through angiographic findings. He also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), likely ischemic in nature, which resulted in significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. Additionally, the patient has a right hip hematoma and was diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), for which he underwent revascularization with Cypher drug-eluting stents placed in the LCx. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, anemia, tachycardia, fever, leukocytosis, acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), acute severe MR, hypernatremia, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, recent total hip replacement surgery, and respiratory failure secondary to CHF. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, persistent hypotension, development of renal failure, progression of aortic stenosis, recurrent atrial fibr"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02 who developed
   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support but
   hypotensive with R hip hematoma.
   #. Hypotension: Most likely from bleed and possibly from poor forward
   flow and decompensated heart failure.  Improved last 24 hours with SBPs
   100s after transfusion 2 units PRBC. HCT now stable with inadequate
   bump 21.9->25 but stable x 12 hours. Has tolerated diuresis as well
   with lasix to keep net negative.
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse HCT <25
   - Follow HCTs q8 hours
   -cautious diuresis
   # Anemia: Consulted heme as detailed in note. Anemia likely
   multifactorial secondary to hematoma, possible component of hemolysis.
   They recommended stopping anticoagulation. Serial exams to monitor
   hematoma
   - holding anticoagulation and DVY ppx; restart lovenox 40 SC daily when
   stable
   - folic acid 5mg po daily
   - Check daily hemolysis labs and trend
   - consider repeat CT if change in exam or symptoms
   # Tachycardia: HR 110s improved to 90s after transfusion. Was likely
   [**2-12**] anemia.
   # R hip hematoma: Likely source of anemia. HCT stable last 12 hours.
   Ortho would not intervene unless sciatic nerve impingement
   - serial exams to monitor for foot drop
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:
   s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to LCx with peak CK
   2964 MB 220.  Has remained chest pain free.
    - Continue Plavix 75, ASA 325, 80 lipitor; holding ACE
   -  restart low dose bb
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis: WBC trending down since [**3-24**]. had low grade
   fever yesterday 100.8 but was after transfusion. Currently on
   vanc/zosyn for VAP course given multifocal PNA on chest CT but no cx
   data to guide management
   - continue vanc/zosyn; vanc changed to 1500 q12 since subtherpaeutic
   - follow-up cultures, all NGTD
   -Check sputum cx, C diff has been negative as well
   -repeat blood cx
   -consider tap effusions if still present
   #. AMS/delirium:
   Improved. Thought likely related to medication affects and  likely
   worsened with possible pneumonia and hypernatremia contributing
   - continue to treat infection with 7 day course of levofloxacin, expand
   abx as above
   - hold further sedating meds
   - Pain control with Tylenol for s/p hip repair.  Would avoid narcotics.
   4. Hypernatremia
   - free water
   5. Acute systolic CHF and acute MR:
   EF 35%
   Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion
   abnormalities with possible pap muscle ischemia and now s/p IABP
   inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR and increase
   coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   - aim to keep negative 1.5 to 2 L today as BP tolerates
   6. AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   8. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Presently in sinus, no afib/flutter overnight, improved rate control
   - Anticoagulation with lovenox SC BID
   - continue metoprolol TID
   9. s/p Total Hip
    - restart dvt prophylaxis with lovenox topmorr
   - Pboots for now
    - per OSH ortho, should be WBAT with posterior precautions
   10. Anemia: Pt with dropping HCT post-op. Concern for bleed (RP since
   s/p cath, from hip post op, or GI given black NGT drainage).  Hct
   stable and bumped approx 2 after tranfusion.
   - consider scan hip/abd/pelvis if HCT continues to trend down
   - follow daily
   11. RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
   - Extubated on [**3-17**], doing well
   #. PPX:, Bowel regimen
   #. FEN : Hyper Na as above. Lyte repletion as needed.

   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support.
   1. CAD/NSTEMI:
   s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to LCx with peak CK
   2964 MB 220.  Has remained chest pain free.
    - Continue Plavix 75, ASA 325, Lisinopril 5, beta blocker 50 TID, and
   statin 80 lipitor
   2. Fever/Leukocytosis:
   WBC increasing, no fever. Etiology is unclear, differential includes
   pneumonia with ? retrocardiac opacity on CXR. [**Month (only) 51**] have VAP/HAP not
   adequately treated with levofloxacin since WBC trending up but still
   afebrile. Leukocytosis could also be stress response
   - continue levofloxacin for now to complete a 7 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 6212**]/09)
   - follow-up cultures
   - Vanc/Zosyn if spikes
   -Check sputum cx, C diff (has been on abx),
   -repeat blood cx and CXR to eval for new infiltrate
   3. AMS/delirium:
   Improved. Thought likely related to medication affects and  likely
   worsened with possible pneumonia and hypernatremia contributing
   - continue to treat infection with 7 day course of levofloxacin, expand
   abx as above
   - hold further sedating meds
   - Pain control with Tylenol for s/p hip repair.  Would avoid narcotics.
   4. Hypernatremia
   Likely related to free water depletion in the setting of being NPO.
   Diet now advanced
   - continue free water repletion with D5W at 120mL
   - check q6h Na
   - encourage free water intake
   5. Acute systolic CHF and acute MR:
   Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. He then developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level, likely caused by occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCx). This resulted in significant mitral regurgitation (MR) due to ischemia, leading to heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

The patient underwent revascularization with Cypher drug-eluting stents placed in the LCx artery, and his peak CK level was 2964 U/L. He has remained free of chest pain since the procedure.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, but he does not have a fever. The cause of this is unclear, with possible differentials including pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP) that may not have been adequately treated with levofloxacin. The patient is being continued on levofloxacin, and follow-up cultures and repeat blood cultures and chest X-ray will be done to evaluate for new infiltrates.
2. Acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute MR: These are likely related to ischemic MR and inferior/in"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02 who developed
   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support but
   hypotensive with R hip hematoma.
   #. Hypotension: Most likely from bleed and possibly from poor forward
   flow and decompensated heart failure.  Improved last 24 hours with SBPs
   100s after transfusion 2 units PRBC. HCT now stable with inadequate
   bump 21.9->25 but stable x 12 hours. Has tolerated diuresis as well
   with lasix to keep net negative.
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse HCT <25
   - Follow HCTs q8 hours
   -cautious diuresis
   # Anemia: Consulted heme as detailed in note. Anemia likely
   multifactorial secondary to hematoma, possible component of hemolysis.
   They recommended stopping anticoagulation. Serial exams to monitor
   hematoma
   - holding anticoagulation and DVY ppx; restart lovenox 40 SC daily when
   stable
   - folic acid 5mg po daily
   - Check daily hemolysis labs and trend
   - consider repeat CT if change in exam or symptoms
   # Tachycardia: HR 110s improved to 90s after transfusion. Was likely
   [**2-12**] anemia.
   # R hip hematoma: Likely source of anemia. HCT stable last 12 hours.
   Ortho would not intervene unless sciatic nerve impingement
   - serial exams to monitor for foot drop
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:
   s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to LCx with peak CK
   2964 MB 220.  Has remained chest pain free.
    - Continue Plavix 75, ASA 325, 80 lipitor; holding ACE
   -  restart low dose bb
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis: WBC trending down since [**3-24**]. had low grade
   fever yesterday 100.8 but was after transfusion. Currently on
   vanc/zosyn for VAP course given multifocal PNA on chest CT but no cx
   data to guide management
   - continue vanc/zosyn; vanc changed to 1500 q12 since subtherpaeutic
   - follow-up cultures, all NGTD
   -Check sputum cx, C diff has been negative as well
   -repeat blood cx
   -consider tap effusions if still present
   #. AMS/delirium:
   Improved. Thought likely related to medication affects and  likely
   worsened with possible pneumonia and hypernatremia contributing
   - continue to treat infection with 7 day course of levofloxacin, expand
   abx as above
   - hold further sedating meds
   - Pain control with Tylenol for s/p hip repair.  Would avoid narcotics.
   4. Hypernatremia
   - free water
   5. Acute systolic CHF and acute MR:
   EF 35%
   Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion
   abnormalities with possible pap muscle ischemia and now s/p IABP
   inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR and increase
   coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   - aim to keep negative 1.5 to 2 L today as BP tolerates
   6. AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   8. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Presently in sinus, no afib/flutter overnight, improved rate control
   - Anticoagulation with lovenox SC BID
   - continue metoprolol TID
   9. s/p Total Hip
    - restart dvt prophylaxis with lovenox topmorr
   - Pboots for now
    - per OSH ortho, should be WBAT with posterior precautions
   10. Anemia: Pt with dropping HCT post-op. Concern for bleed (RP since
   s/p cath, from hip post op, or GI given black NGT drainage).  Hct
   stable and bumped approx 2 after tranfusion.
   - consider scan hip/abd/pelvis if HCT continues to trend down
   - follow daily
   11. RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
   - Extubated on [**3-17**], doing well
   #. PPX:, Bowel regimen
   #. FEN : Hyper Na as above. Lyte repletion as needed.
   - nectar thick liquids, ground solids, PO meds crushed with puree; 1:1

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002 and developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a peak creatine kinase (CK) level of 1516. The patient has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), likely due to ischemic heart disease, which has resulted in heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a hip hematoma and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to bleeding and poor forward flow due to decompensated heart failure. This condition can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and tissue hypoxia.

2. Anemia: The patient is experiencing anemia, which is likely multifactorial in origin. It could be caused by the hip hematoma, possible component of hemolysis, or other underlying causes. Anemia can result in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a medical history of recent right hip surgery, post-operative non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and a new mitral regurgitation (MR) with two diseased coronary arteries treated by percutaneous coronary intervention (DES). The patient also required the use of a balloon pump, experienced ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and had a right hip bleed. Currently, the patient is more medically stable.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, there is the concern of the right hip bleed, which is attributed to recent surgery and anticoagulation. The plan is to restart Lovenox, monitor hematocrit levels, repeat leg CT if there are suspicions of another bleed, and administer folic acid daily.

Secondly, the patient has tachycardia, likely due to anemia. The plan is to uptitrate metoprolol as tolerated by blood pressure.

Thirdly, the patient has VAP. Leukocytosis is trending down, and there is no fever. However, there are large bilaterally pleural effusions, and concern for aspiration exists. The plan is to continue with Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Vancomycin, follow trough levels, follow up on sputum culture, and use incentive spirometry.

Fourthly, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02 who developed
   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support with R hip
   hematoma.
   # Hypoxia: Likely from PNA, atelectasis, anemia, and heart failure. [**Month (only) 51**]
   have also had some mucus plugging, although not producing sputum. Also
   patient is very deconditioned from his prolonged hospitalization.
   -          Cont diuresis and abx as below
   -          Monitor hct
   -          Incentive spirometry
   -          Follow PT recs
   #. Hypotension/Tachycardia: Most likely from bleed. Both are much
   improved this am, with HR in the 80s overnight. Received 2 units RBCs,
   which has likely aided this. Tolerating diuresis as well with lasix to
   keep net negative.
   - continue to monitor
   # Anemia: Consulted heme as detailed in note. Anemia likely
   multifactorial secondary to hematoma, possible component of hemolysis.
   Currently off anticoagulation, although hematoma and hct stable.
   - Restart lovenox 30 SC BID as hct stable.
    - folic acid 5mg po daily
   - Check daily hemolysis labs per Heme, and f/u other recs
   - consider repeat CT if change in exam or symptoms (ex
 foot drop from
   hematoma)
   - pm hct, transfuse under 24
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:
   s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to LCx with peak CK
   2964 MB 220.  Has remained chest pain free.
   - Continue Plavix 75, ASA 325, 80 lipitor, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Restart ACE if BP allows
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis: WBC trending down since [**3-24**], Afebrile since
   [**3-28**] 1200. Currently on vanc/zosyn (day [**8-18**]) for VAP course given
   multifocal PNA on chest CT but no cx data to guide management.
   - continue vanc/zosyn and f/u trough at 11:30am (6am value today is a
   peak)
   - follow-up cultures, all NGTD
   5. Acute systolic CHF and acute MR:
   EF 35%
   Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion
   abnormalities with possible pap muscle ischemia and now s/p IABP
   inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR and increase
   coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   - aim to keep negative 1.5 to 2 L today as BP tolerates
   6. AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   8. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Presently in sinus, no afib/flutter overnight, improved rate control
   - Anticoagulation with lovenox SC BID
   - continue metoprolol TID
   9. s/p Total Hip
    - restart dvt prophylaxis with lovenox topmorr
   - Pboots for now
    - per OSH ortho, should be WBAT with posterior precautions

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a previous ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) who developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a rising troponin level. The likely culprit artery is the left circumflex (LCx), as indicated by precordial and lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the patient has a hip hematoma and is receiving intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxia, likely due to pneumonia (PNA), atelectasis, anemia, and heart failure. The patient is also experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, most likely from bleeding but improved with blood transfusion. The patient has anemia, which is likely multifactorial secondary to hematoma and possible hemolysis. The patient's cardiac history includes coronary artery disease (CAD) with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), for which he underwent revascularization with Cypher stents in the LCx artery. The patient is currently on multiple cardiac medications.

The patient also has fever and leukocytosis, which have been trending down since March 24th, and he"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02 who developed
   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support but
   hypotensive with R hip hematoma.
   #. Hypotension: Most likely from bleed and possibly from poor forward
   flow and decompensated heart failure.  Improved last 24 hours with SBPs
   100s after transfusion 2 units PRBC. HCT now stable with inadequate
   bump 21.9->25 but stable x 12 hours. Has tolerated diuresis as well
   with lasix to keep net negative.
   - continue to monitor
   - transfuse HCT <25
   - Follow HCTs q8 hours
   -cautious diuresis
   # Anemia: Consulted heme as detailed in note. Anemia likely
   multifactorial secondary to hematoma, possible component of hemolysis.
   They recommended stopping anticoagulation. Serial exams to monitor
   hematoma
   - holding anticoagulation and DVY ppx; restart lovenox 40 SC daily when
   stable
   - folic acid 5mg po daily
   - Check daily hemolysis labs and trend
   - consider repeat CT if change in exam or symptoms
   # Tachycardia: HR 110s improved to 90s after transfusion. Was likely
   [**2-12**] anemia.
   # R hip hematoma: Likely source of anemia. HCT stable last 12 hours.
   Ortho would not intervene unless sciatic nerve impingement
   - serial exams to monitor for foot drop
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:
   s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to LCx with peak CK
   2964 MB 220.  Has remained chest pain free.
    - Continue Plavix 75, ASA 325, 80 lipitor; holding ACE
   -  restart low dose bb
   #. Fever/Leukocytosis: WBC trending down since [**3-24**]. had low grade
   fever yesterday 100.8 but was after transfusion. Currently on
   vanc/zosyn for VAP course given multifocal PNA on chest CT but no cx
   data to guide management
   - continue vanc/zosyn; vanc changed to 1500 q12 since subtherpaeutic
   - follow-up cultures, all NGTD
   -Check sputum cx, C diff has been negative as well
   -repeat blood cx
   -consider tap effusions if still present
   #. AMS/delirium:
   Improved. Thought likely related to medication affects and  likely
   worsened with possible pneumonia and hypernatremia contributing
   - continue to treat infection with 7 day course of levofloxacin, expand
   abx as above
   - hold further sedating meds
   - Pain control with Tylenol for s/p hip repair.  Would avoid narcotics.
   4. Hypernatremia
   - free water
   5. Acute systolic CHF and acute MR:
   EF 35%
   Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion
   abnormalities with possible pap muscle ischemia and now s/p IABP
   inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR and increase
   coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   - aim to keep negative 1.5 to 2 L today as BP tolerates
   6. AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   8. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Presently in sinus, no afib/flutter overnight, improved rate control
   - Anticoagulation with lovenox SC BID
   - continue metoprolol TID
   9. s/p Total Hip
    - restart dvt prophylaxis with lovenox topmorr
   - Pboots for now
    - per OSH ortho, should be WBAT with posterior precautions
   10. Anemia: Pt with dropping HCT post-op. Concern for bleed (RP since
   s/p cath, from hip post op, or GI given black NGT drainage).  Hct
   stable and bumped approx 2 after tranfusion.
   - consider scan hip/abd/pelvis if HCT continues to trend down
   - follow daily
   11. RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
   - Extubated on [**3-17**], doing well
   #. PPX:, Bowel regimen
   #. FEN : Hyper Na as above. Lyte repletion as needed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. During the surgery, he developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a peak CK level of 1516 (rising), and the culprit artery was identified as the left circumflex artery (LCx). He also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, leading to significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's right hip has a hematoma, and he has been hypotensive, but his blood pressure improved to the 100s after transfusion with two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). His hematocrit (HCT) has stabilized at 25%, and he is tolerating diuretics.

The patient's anemia is multifactorial, secondary to the hematoma and possible component of hemolysis. Anticoagulation has been held, and serial exams are being monitored for any changes. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to anemia, which improved after transfusion. The right hip hematoma is causing anemia and is being monitored for any progression. Orthopedic consultation is pending, as intervention is only considered if there is sciatic nerve impingement.

The patient underwent revascularization with Cypher (drug"

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a medical history of recent right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation (MR), and two DES to the left coronary artery who required a balloon pump. The patient's current conditions include right hip bleed, tachycardia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and chronic kidney disease.

The patient has been medically stable but still requires close monitoring. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Right hip bleed: The patient had a right hip bleed due to recent surgery and anticoagulation. It is important to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels closely and consider repeating a leg CT if there are any signs of bleeding. The patient should also be monitored for any signs of re-bleeding.

2. Tachycardia: The patient has a tachycardia likely caused by anemia. The heart rate should be monitored regularly, and the patient's blood count should be checked frequently. Metoprolol can be uptitrated as tolerated to manage the heart rate.

3. VAP: The patient has ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is indicated by leukocytosis trending down and no fever. The patient's sputum culture should be followed up, and incentive spirometry should be continued to aid in lung expansion.

4. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with NSTEMI after hip surgery and subsequent DES"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, and new mitral regurgitation. He also has two drug-eluting stents in the left coronary artery and required a balloon pump. His course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Right hip bleed: This is due to recent surgery and anticoagulation. The plan includes monitoring hematocrit (Hct) closely, retarting Lovenox, and considering a repeat leg CT if there are suspicions of another bleed.

2. Tachycardia: This is likely due to anemia. The plan is to uptitrate metoprolol as tolerated by blood pressure.

3. VAP: Leukocytosis is trending down and there is no fever. The patient has large bilateral pleural effusions, and there is a concern for aspiration. The plan is to continue with Zosyn and vancomycin, follow troughs, follow up on sputum culture, and encourage incentive spirometry.

4. CAD: The patient had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) after hip surgery, with stenting of the left coronary artery twice. The plan is to continue with aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, and metoprolol, while holding"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative complications including NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation, and the need for a balloon pump. The patient also had a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed. Currently, the patient is more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right hip bleed: This is a concern due to recent surgery and anticoagulation. The plan is to monitor the patient's hematocrit levels closely, repeat leg CT if there are suspicions of bleeding again, and restart Lovenox.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to anemia. The plan is to uptitrate metoprolol as tolerated by the patient's blood pressure.

3. VAP: The patient has a decreasing leukocyte count and no fever. There are large bilateral pleural effusions, and concern for aspiration. The plan is to continue with Zosyn and vancomycin, follow troughs, and obtain follow-up sputum culture. Incentive spirometry will also be continued.

4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient had an NSTE MI after hip surgery, which required stenting of the left circumflex artery twice. The plan is to continue with aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, and metoprolol. Holding ace is planned due to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and post-operative NSTEMI with new mitral regurgitation (MR). He required a balloon pump due to complications of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. The patient is now more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. R hip bleed: The patient had a right hip bleed due to recent surgery and anticoagulation. It is important to monitor hematocrit levels closely, as they have been stable. The patient should continue receiving folic acid daily, repeat leg CT if there are suspicions of bleed again, and continue Lovenox for now.
2. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing tachycardia, likely from anemia. Metoprolol dosage should be increased to 12.5 mg TID and uptitrated as blood pressure allows.
3. CHF and new MR: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 35% and is volume overloaded. Diurese should be continued as blood pressure allows, with a goal of negative 1 liter.
4. VAP: The patient had an 8-day course of vancomycin/zosyn. Leukocytosis is trending down, and there is no fever. However, the patient has large bilateral pleural effusions.
5. CAD: The patient had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEM"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and post-operative NSTEMI with a new mitral regurgitation (MR). He has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with two DES placed in the left coronary artery and required a balloon pump. The patient's course was complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, he is more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right hip bleed: The patient had a hip bleed due to recent surgery and anticoagulation. Monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is recommended, and a repeat leg CT scan should be considered if there are any suspicions of ongoing bleed. Continuing Lovenox for now is advised.

2. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing tachycardia, which is likely due to anemia. Increasing metoprolol to 12.5 mg TID and titrating as blood pressure allows is suggested.

3. CHF and new MR: The patient has a decreased ejection fraction of 35% and is volume overloaded. Diuresis should be continued as blood pressure allows, aiming for a negative fluid balance of approximately one liter.

4. VAP: The patient has VAP after an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Leukocytosis is trending down, and there is no fever. The patient also has large"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is not mentioned, but there are several significant events in the past 24 hours. 

The patient was given Lasix intravenously to address fluid balance, and the dose was increased to 40 mg IV due to poor response. Metoprolol was uptitrated to improve heart rate control. Antibiotics were completed, and the patient's blood pressure improved throughout the day.

Allergies were assessed, and no known drug allergies were reported. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Infusions included enoxaparin (Lovenox) for anticoagulation and furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management. Other medications mentioned are not specified in the provided information.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some noted below. The flow sheet data shows vital signs with stable temperature, slightly low blood pressure, and normal heart rate and respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation remains at 98% on nasal cannula.

Hemodynamic monitoring indicates an ongoing positive fluid balance, with total intake exceeding total output by 1,550 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///33.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative complications including NSTEMI, mitral regurgitation (MR), and a right hip bleed. The patient was also on a balloon pump and had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's current medical stability has been improved, but there are several potential medical complications to consider:

1. Right hip bleed: The patient had a hip bleed due to recent surgery and anticoagulation. To manage this, prophylactic dose Lovenox should be continued, and the patient should be monitored closely. A repeat leg CT may be necessary if there are any suspicions of bleeding.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely caused by anemia. Metoprolol dosage should be increased to 12.5 mg TID and uptitrated as tolerated.

3. CHF and new MR: The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 35% and is volume overloaded. Blood pressure has improved with diuretics, so it is important to continue diuresis as BP allows, aiming for a negative fluid balance of up to 1 liter.

4. VAP: The patient had an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Leukocytosis is trending down, and there is no fever. However, the patient"

   DES to Lcx and required balloon pump, course complicatd by VAP and R
   hip bleed, now more medically stable.
   Shortness of breath
   Patient continues to appear fluid overloaded. No further evidence of
   infection, although does have sputum production.
   - continue to diurese and aim for at least 1L negative
   - obtain additional sputum culture
   R hip bleed. From recent surgery and anticoagulation.
   - folic acid daily
   - repeat leg CT if suspicious of bleed again
   - monitor hct closely, has been stable
   - continue prophylactic dose Lovenox for now
   Tachycardia.  Likely from anemia.
   - continue metoprolol 25mg PO tid . Uptitrate as bp allows.
   CHF and new MR:
   EF 35%.  Volume overloaded. BP has improved with diuresis
   - continue to diurese as BP allows (goal neg [**1-12**] liter)
   VAP. s/p 8 day course of vanco/zosyn ([**Date range (1) 6427**]. Leukocytosis
   trending down and no fever.  Also has large bilateral pleural
   effusions.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of recent right hip surgery and postoperative non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) who developed a new mitral regurgitation (MR). He has been on mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia and required a balloon pump. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient has shown improvement with antibiotic therapy, diuresis, and hemodynamic stability. However, he remains critically ill with ongoing fluid overload, persistent oxygen requirement, and unresolved large bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has completed an antibiotic course, but persistent oxygen requirement and unresolved CXR indicate a possibility of unresolved pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever and leukocytosis, will be crucial. Additional sputum cultures may be necessary.
2. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient's recent NSTEMI has been stabilized with beta-blocker uptitration. Regular monitoring for recurrent ischemic symptoms and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes is essential.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): Although the patient is currently in sinus rhythm, the risk of recurrence exists. Close monitoring for symptoms of AFib and consideration of anticoagulation when the patient's hip bleed is under control are important.
4. Heart Failure ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, and new mitral regurgitation (MR). He required balloon pump support and had complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. The patient appears more medically stable at present.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fluid Overload: The patient continues to appear fluid overloaded, as indicated by the presence of crackles at the bases bilaterally and a positive fluid balance of -1550 mL. Further diuresis is recommended to aim for at least 1 L negative fluid balance.

2. Sputum Production: The patient has sputum production, which may indicate an ongoing respiratory infection or potential pneumonia. Obtaining additional sputum cultures is advised to evaluate for any new or persistent infections.

3. Right Hip Bleed: The patient had a right hip bleed following surgery and anticoagulation. Close monitoring of hemoglobin (Hct) levels is necessary, and repeat leg CT should be considered if there are suspicions of another bleed. Prophylactic dose of Lovenox should be continued for now.

4. Tachycardia: The patient exhibits tachycardia, likely due to anemia. Continuing metoprolol at a dose of 25 mg PO tid is recommended. Uptitration of the dose as tolerated is advised.

5. CHF and New MR: The"

The patient is now more medically stable, but continues to appear fluid overloaded with shortness of breath. He has sputum production but no further evidence of infection. The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix), metoprolol, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and various other medications for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid Overload: The patient appears to be fluid overloaded, as indicated by his physical examination findings of crackles at the bases bilaterally and an elevated JVP. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of CHF with a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. His current presentation suggests volume overload, which can exacerbate heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath and fluid retention.
3. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has a new MR, which may contribute to his symptoms of shortness of breath and fluid overload. MR can lead to volume overload and pulmonary congestion.
4. Right Hip Bleed: The patient had a right hip bleed, likely due to recent surgery and anticoagulation. This can result in"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and post-operative NSTEMI with new mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient also has two DES (Drug-Eluting Stents) in the left coronary artery and required a balloon pump. The patient's course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed.

The patient appears more medically stable at the moment. However, he continues to experience shortness of breath and appears to be fluid overloaded. There is no further evidence of infection, but he does have sputum production. The plan is to continue diuresis and aim for at least 1 liter negative fluid balance. Additionally, an additional sputum culture will be obtained.

The patient also has a history of right hip bleed, likely due to recent surgery and anticoagulation. The plan is to provide folic acid daily, repeat leg CT if there are suspicions of bleed again, monitor hematocrit (hct) closely as it has been stable, and continue prophylactic dose Lovenox for now.

The patient is experiencing tachycardia, which is likely from anemia. The plan is to continue metoprolol 25mg PO tid and uptitrate as blood pressure allows.

The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and new MR, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and was diagnosed with post-operative NSTEMI. He has a new mitral regurgitation (MR) with two blocked coronary arteries requiring balloon pump support. His medical history includes a complicated course with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), right hip bleed, and now shows signs of improvement in stability. The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, likely due to resolving pneumonia, volume overload, and pleural effusion. Tachycardia is likely caused by anemia. The patient's condition includes congestive heart failure (CHF) and new MR with an ejection fraction of 35%. He is volume overloaded but has shown improvement with diuretic therapy. Blood pressure needs to be monitored, and diuresis should continue as tolerated. The patient also has a history of right hip bleed, which is stable and resolving, and was caused by recent surgery and anticoagulation. Prophylactic dose of Lovenox should be continued. VAP has been treated with an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and leukocytosis is trending down without fever. The patient has large bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's cardiovascular history includes a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) after hip surgery, with two stents placed in the left circumflex artery. Medications include aspirin, clo"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative complications including NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation (MR), and required a balloon pump. The patient also had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed, which is now stable and resolving. Additionally, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous DES placement in the left circumflex artery.

The patient's current conditions include pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction (AMI, NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), acute heart failure (CHF), aortic stenosis, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient is currently in the ICU and is medically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's ongoing significant oxygen requirement suggests ongoing respiratory compromise, and the presence of bilateral pleural effusions may contribute to impaired gas exchange.

2. Heart Failure: The patient's acute CHF is likely due to volume overload, as indicated by his low blood pressure and evidence of fluid overload on the flow sheet. Continued diuresis and optimization of medications will be necessary to manage this condition.

3. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at increased risk for thromboembolic events due to recent surgery, anticoagulation therapy"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, and new mitral regurgitation. He has undergone two DES procedures to the left coronary artery and required a balloon pump. The patient's course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, he appears more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shortness of breath: The patient continues to appear fluid overloaded and has sputum production. He may experience further respiratory distress if fluid overload persists or if there is a worsening of underlying pulmonary conditions.
2. Right hip bleed: The patient's recent surgery and anticoagulation therapy put him at risk for a hip bleed. Monitoring his hematocrit levels closely and considering a repeat leg CT scan if there are suspicions of another bleed are essential.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate is likely due to anemia. Close monitoring of his heart rate and consideration of uptitration of metoprolol as tolerated are recommended.
4. CHF and new MR: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 35% and is volume overloaded. Continued diuresis to achieve negative fluid balance is necessary.
5. VAP: The patient had an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Leukocytosis is trending down, and there is no"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative complications including NSTEMI and a new mitral regurgitation (MR) with two DES placed in the left coronary artery. He also had a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed. The patient's current condition is more medically stable, but he presents with shortness of breath, likely due to resolving pneumonia, volume overload, and pleural effusion. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently in sinus rhythm. He also has chronic kidney disease, anemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pleural effusion: The patient has large bilateral pleural effusions, which can potentially lead to respiratory distress and compromise oxygenation.
2. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The patient's ejection fraction is 35%, indicating reduced cardiac function, and he is volume overloaded. This increases the risk of CHF exacerbation and fluid accumulation.
3. MR (Mitral Regurgitation): The new onset MR can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath and heart failure.
4. R hip bleed: Although stable and resolving, there is still a risk of rebleeding or complications related to the recent surgery and anticoagulation.
5. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): The patient previously had VAP, and there is a risk of recurrence"

   VAP
   s/p 8 day course of vanco/zosyn ([**Date range (1) 6427**]). However, respiratory
   status has not improved much, and pt spiked fever when Tylenol held
   yesterday, suggesting persistent PNA. His vanc trough early in his
   prior abx course was 10.6, so this drug may have been underdosed. WBC
   decreased after starting abx overnight. Seems less volume overloaded on
   exam. Doubt thoracentesis would offer much respiratory improvement.
   - Cont vanco, pip-tazo
   - add levoflox if he spikes
   - Send sputum cx if able. F/u blood and urine cx.
   - Goal even today
   - Encourage incentive spirometer
   - Chest PT

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation, and two drug-eluting stents placed in the left coronary artery. He required a balloon pump and was previously treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, the patient is more medically stable but still has persistent symptoms. His vital signs show a fever, decreased white blood cell count, and stable blood pressure. Physical examination reveals scattered crackles in the lungs, soft abdomen, and edema in the right lower extremity. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, diuretics, antiplatelet agents, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent Pneumonia: The patient has not shown significant improvement in respiratory status, and there is a suspicion of persistent pneumonia. This can be indicated by the fever and elevated white blood cell count.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction is 35%, indicating reduced heart function. He is volume overloaded but improving. There is a risk of worsening heart failure if fluid balance is not maintained appropriately.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient had a hip bleed and was on anticoagulation therapy. Although the bleed is resolving,"

   s/p 8 day course of vanco/zosyn ([**Date range (1) 6427**]). However, respiratory
   status has not improved much, and pt spiked fever when Tylenol held
   yesterday, suggesting persistent PNA. His vanc trough early in his
   prior abx course was 10.6, so this drug may have been underdosed. WBC
   decreased after starting abx overnight. Seems less volume overloaded on
   exam. Doubt thoracentesis would offer much respiratory improvement.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hip surgery, postoperative NSTEMI, and new mitral regurgitation. He has been medically stable but continues to experience respiratory issues, including VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), as evidenced by fever, worsening right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, and persistent positive blood cultures despite previous antibiotic therapy. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased after starting antibiotics. He also has a history of CHF (congestive heart failure) and an ejection fraction of 35%. The patient's blood pressure is stable on captopril, and diuresis is being continued to achieve negative fluid balance. His tachycardia is likely due to infection, which has improved over the past 24 hours. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's persistent fever, worsening right upper lobe infiltrate, and positive blood cultures suggest ongoing infection despite antibiotic therapy. The patient may require a change in antibiotics or additional interventions to treat the VAP effectively.
2. Heart failure (CHF): The patient's history of CHF and an ejection fraction of 35% indicate compromised cardiac function. Fluid overload and inadequate diuresis could lead to worsening heart failure symptoms. Close monitoring of fluid balance and ongoing diuretic therapy will be essential to manage this condition.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation, and previous balloon pump use. He has been medically stable but continues to have persistent pneumonia (VAP) despite an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. His respiratory status has not improved significantly, and he spiked a fever when Tylenol was held yesterday. The patient's white blood cell count decreased after starting antibiotics overnight. He appears to be less volume overloaded on examination. The healthcare team doubts that a thoracentesis would offer much respiratory improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory status has not improved much despite antibiotic treatment, suggesting that the pneumonia may be persistent. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential septic shock.
2. Infection-related fever: The patient's spike in fever when Tylenol was held suggests ongoing infection. This can indicate a worsening condition if not appropriately managed.
3. Volume overload: The patient has been volume overloaded, which can contribute to heart failure symptoms and decreased oxygenation.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, mitral regurgitation, and coronary artery disease. These cardiac conditions can worsen over time if not adequately managed.
5. Bleeding risk: The patient had a hip bleed in the past, and he is still on proph"

He also has a past complication of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. The patient's current condition is described as more medically stable.

The patient's recent progress includes being on an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, but his respiratory status has not improved significantly, and he experienced fever when Tylenol was withheld yesterday, suggesting persistent pneumonia. His vancomycin trough early in the previous antibiotic course was 10.6, indicating that this drug may have been underdosed. The patient's white blood cell count decreased after starting antibiotics overnight. He appears to be less volume overloaded on examination, and it is doubtful that a thoracentesis would provide much respiratory improvement.

The physician's plan is to continue vancomycin, send sputum cultures if possible, follow up with blood and urine cultures, aim for negative fluid balance of 1 liter today, encourage the use of an incentive spirometer, and order a chest X-ray. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to infection and has improved over the past 24 hours, so metoprolol 25mg PO tid will be continued.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not mentioned. However, the note highlights several significant events that occurred within the past 24 hours. The patient's temperature spiked to 101 degrees Fahrenheit, prompting the order of blood cultures and initiation of levofloxacin for double coverage against Pseudomonas and atypical pathogens. Additionally, due to recurrent aspiration and high-risk aspiration, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was recommended, and the patient was kept nil per os (NPO), meaning nothing by mouth.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin. The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including Enoxaparin (Lovenox) and Lansoprazole (Prevacid).

Under review of systems, no changes are noted except as mentioned below. The flow sheet data as of [**2153-4-4**] 04:27 AM provides information on vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other parameters.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius (98.4 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 87 beats per minute with a range of 83-110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 54/35 mmHg to 125/"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation, and two DES to the left coronary artery requiring a balloon pump. The patient has had complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, the patient is more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent pneumonia: The patient's fever when Tylenol was held suggests persistent pneumonia. The respiratory status has not improved much despite an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. The WBC count decreased after starting antibiotics, indicating a possible improvement. However, the patient's sputum culture has not been sent yet, and there is concern about persistent PNA.
2. Underdosing of vancomycin: The patient's vancomycin trough early in the antibiotic course was 10.6, which may have been underdosed. This could contribute to persistent infection.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). CCU team.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   - levofloxacin added for broader coverage
   - Dobhoff tube clogged
   - looks and feels slightly better today
   Plan:
   1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage
   2. PEG tube today - needs Plavix TODAY and needs nutrition
   3. [**Hospital 6527**] medical therapy

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative necrotizing fasciitis with a need for a balloon pump. He also had a history of NSTEMI and required two stents to be placed in the left coronary artery. The patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed, which has since stabilized. He is currently in the ICU and is more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's temperature has been spiking again, indicating a possible new infection or ongoing infection. Aspiration pneumonia should be considered given the patient's recurrent aspiration.
2. Inadequate antibiotic coverage: The patient's vancomycin levels were intermittently subtherapeutic, raising concerns about the adequacy of his antibiotic regimen.
3. CHF and new mitral regurgitation: The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF 35%) and may develop congestive heart failure (CHF) due to the new mitral regurgitation. Adequate diuresis should be maintained.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely due to infection. It is being managed with metoprolol.
5. Right hip bleed: Although the bleed is stable and resolving, there is a risk of further bleeding due to recent surgery and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient had a NSTEMI after hip surgery"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation, and 2 DES to the left coronary artery requiring a balloon pump. He has had complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, he is more medically stable but presents with recurrent aspiration and a high risk of aspiration, leading to the recommendation of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient has been febrile, with temperatures spiking to 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Blood cultures were sent, and antibiotics were started for double coverage against Pseudomonas and atypical organisms. The patient also has chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. He is receiving various medications and treatments including enoxaparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and metoprolol for heart rate control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent aspiration and high risk of aspiration may lead to further respiratory infections or pneumonia.
2. The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen due to inadequate fluid balance or medication side effects.
3. The patient's congestive heart failure may deteriorate if fluid overload occurs or if medications are not properly managed.
4. The patient's coronary artery disease may lead to further cardiac events if not adequately managed.

   prior abx course was 10.6, so this drug may have been underdosed. WBC
   decreased after starting abx overnight. Seems less volume overloaded on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with a new mitral regurgitation (MR). He required the use of a balloon pump and developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. The patient's current condition is described as more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent Pneumonia: The patient continues to have a fever and respiratory symptoms despite previous antibiotic treatment, suggesting persistent pneumonia.
2. Volume Overload: The patient shows signs of volume overload, which may worsen his heart failure and respiratory status.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 35%, indicating impaired cardiac function and potential heart failure exacerbation.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) suggests an ongoing infection, possibly due to persistent pneumonia or another source.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to recent surgery, immobilization, and anticoagulation therapy.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly considering the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and anticoagulants.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to an increased"

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation (MR), and 2 DES to left coronary artery requiring balloon pump. The patient's course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. 

The patient is currently more medically stable, but still has several ongoing issues. He has a fever and leukocytosis, which was initially treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). However, the patient started spiking fevers again, suggesting a new pneumonia, possibly aspiration. The white blood cell count is trending down, and the patient has been afebrile for 24 hours.

The plan is to restart vancomycin and Zosyn and add levofloxacin for double gram-negative coverage. Blood cultures, chest X-rays, urine culture, and sputum culture will be followed. Monitoring chest X-rays every other day will help assess interval improvement.

The patient also has congestive heart failure (CHF) and new MR, with an ejection fraction of 35%. He appears clinically euvolemic and adequately diuresed.

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation, and two DES (drug-eluting stents) in the left coronary artery requiring balloon pump support. The patient's medical course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, the patient appears more medically stable.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis persisted despite completing an 8-day course of vancomycin (vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (zosyn). The patient recently started spiking again, likely due to a new pneumonia, with a question of aspiration. There is also a concern about whether he had adequate vancomycin levels because they were intermittently subtherapeutic. The white blood cell count continues to trend down, and the patient has been afebrile for 24 hours.

The patient's conditions include:
1. Fever/Leukocytosis: Restarted vanc/zosyn and added levofloxacin for double gram-negative coverage. Follow-up blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture are planned. Monitor chest X-rays every other day for interval improvement.
2. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure) and new MR (Mitral Regurgitation): The patient's ejection fraction is 35%. Adequately diuresed and clinically euvolemic. Continue metoprolol,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation (MR), and two DES placed in the left coronary artery requiring balloon pump support. The patient's clinical course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, the patient is more medically stable.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis have improved after completing an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. However, the patient has recently started spiking again, likely due to new pneumonia, with a question of aspiration. There is also concern about subtherapeutic levels of vancomycin intermittently. The white blood cell count continues to trend down, and the patient has been afebrile for 24 hours.

The patient's chest X-rays will be monitored every other day to evaluate interval improvement. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving tube feeds due to a high suspicion of aspiration causing multifocal pneumonia. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube will be placed by the interventional radiology (IR) team this morning.

The patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) and new MR are being managed with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. The patient is adequately diuresed and appears clinically euvolemic. Metoprol"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative complications including NSTEMI, mitral regurgitation, two DES to left coronary artery, and required a balloon pump. He also had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed. Currently, the patient is more medically stable.

The patient has been experiencing fever spikes again, which is likely due to a new pneumonia, possibly aspiration. There are concerns about whether the previous antibiotic therapy was adequate as the drug levels were intermittently subtherapeutic. As a result, the patient has been restarted on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, with levofloxacin added for double coverage against gram-negative bacteria. Blood cultures have been followed up, along with urine and sputum cultures.

The patient has congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35%. Adequate diuresis has been maintained, with the goal of keeping the patient between -500 to 1 liter fluid balance today. The use of ACE inhibitors has been held due to marginal blood pressure.

The patient has also experienced tachycardia, which is likely related to infection but has improved over the past 24 hours. Metoprolol 25mg PO tid will be continued.

Regarding the right hip bleed, it is stable and resolving. This was likely caused by recent surgery and anticoagulation. F"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). CCU team.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Doing ?slightly better today, but continue to have very little
   cardiopulmonary reserve.  Appears euvolemic.
   Plan:
   1. PEG tube today
   2. Attempt to tap pleural effusion under fluoroscopic guidance by IR
   3. Continue antibiotics
   4. Continue secondary prevention for CAD following NSTEMI
   5. PT as tolerated
   6. ICU care [**2-12**] respiratory insufficiency

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation (MR), and two DES placed in the left coronary artery. The patient required a balloon pump and had complications of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. 

The patient is currently more medically stable but continues to experience fever and leukocytosis. The initial course of antibiotics (vanc/zosyn) was completed, but the patient recently started spiking again, indicating a new possible pneumonia, with a question of aspiration. The white blood cell count is trending down, and the patient has been afebrile for 24 hours. 

The patient's chest X-ray showed improvement. The plan is to restart vanc/zosyn and add levofloxacin for double gram-negative coverage. Chest PT, follow-up blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture, and monitoring of CXRs every other day are recommended to assess interval improvement. 

The patient has congestive heart failure (CHF) and new MR with an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. Adequate diuresis is being administered, and the patient appears clinically euvolemic. 

The patient's nutrition is being provided through tube feeds, but there is a high suspicion of aspiration causing multifocal pneumonia. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube will be placed"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, and new mitral regurgitation (MR) with two DES to the left coronary artery and required balloon pump. He has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, he is more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient had completed an 8-day course of Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam but recently started spiking again, likely from new pneumonia, with the possibility of aspiration. There is a question about whether he had adequate Vancomycin levels, as they were intermittently subtherapeutic. The white blood cell count is trending down, and he has been afebrile for 24 hours.
- Restarted Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.
- Added Levofloxacin for double gram-negative coverage.
- Chest X-ray (CXR), follow-up blood cultures, follow-up urine culture, follow-up sputum culture, and monitoring CXRs every other day to assess interval improvement.

2. CHF and new MR: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction of 35%. He is adequately diuresed, seems clinically euvolemic, and has a goal to keep even fluid intake and output.
- Continue Metoprolol.
- Follow I/Os closely to maintain"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient underwent thoracentesis, removing 1L of fluid, which appears to be a transudate. The patient remains oxygen dependent and tachypneic with no clinical improvement. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 104/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient has a history of heart failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and aortic stenosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's impaired ventilation and prolonged immobilization in the ICU may increase the risk of developing pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient's history of heart failure, impaired endurance, and symptoms such as chest pain or changes in cardiac rhythm could indicate an increased risk for acute myocardial infarction.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility, decreased peripheral perfusion, and underlying comorbidities like atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of developing DVT.
4. Delirium: The patient's impaired balance, impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired skin integrity"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including heart failure, aortic stenosis, and chronic anemia. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of his conditions. The patient underwent a thoracentesis procedure, which involved removing fluid from his chest cavity. However, he did not show any clinical improvement after the procedure. His vital signs are stable, but he is still dependent on oxygen and experiencing tachypnea. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating ongoing fluid loss. His laboratory results indicate abnormalities in various parameters such as hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose levels, and others. He has multiple comorbidities and is currently on several medications including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and other ICU medications. The patient's physical examination reveals impaired peripheral pulses and neurologic responses.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's impaired ventilation and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing pneumonia, especially ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP).

2. Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient's history of heart failure and aortic stenosis puts him at risk for a myocardial infarction. The combination of his acute symptoms and abnormal lab values may indicate an ongoing cardiac event.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a medical history of recent right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation, and two DES to the left coronary artery requiring balloon pump support. He has also had complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. The patient's current condition is more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam but still has a fever. It is likely that he has pneumonia that was not completely cleared, and there is a question of aspiration. The white blood cell count is trending down, and he has been afebrile for 72 hours. The plan is to restart vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, add levofloxacin for double gram-negative coverage, and perform follow-up blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture, and monitor chest X-rays every other day for interval improvement.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and new Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. He is adequately hydrated and clinically euvolemic. The plan is to continue metoprolol and follow input/output (I/O) goals to keep even today, while holding ace for marginal blood pressure.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and subsequently developed post-operative NSTEMI with new mitral regurgitation (MR). He required a balloon pump and experienced complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. The patient's condition has improved and he is now more medically stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient recently started spiking fevers again, which may indicate a new pneumonia, possibly aspiration. There is a question about whether he had adequate vancomycin coverage due to intermittently subtherapeutic levels. White blood cell count is trending down, and the patient has been afebrile for 24 hours.
2. CHF and new MR: The patient has a decreased ejection fraction of 35% and is experiencing congestive heart failure (CHF). He appears clinically euvolemic, adequately diuresed, and is being monitored closely.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to infection, but it has improved over the past 24 hours.
4. R Hip Bleed: The patient had a right hip bleed, which is stable and resolving. It was likely caused by recent surgery and anticoagulation.
5. CAD: The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) after hip surgery and underwent stenting in the left coronary artery"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 350**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). CCU team.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Thoracentesis yesterday with removal of 1L of transudate, but no
   improvement in breathing
   Looks uncomfortable
   Plan:
   1. Pulmonary and ID consultations: do we need to change abx and do we
   need to consider bronchoscopy?
   2. Gentle diuresis
   3. PEG tube
   4. Cont ICU care [**2-12**] respiratory failure

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation (MR), and two stents to the left coronary artery. He required a balloon pump and has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. The patient is now more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been on an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, but still has a fever and is suspected to have pneumonia that was not completely cleared. There is a question of aspiration. The white blood cell count is trending down, and the patient has been afebrile for 72 hours.
2. CHF and new MR: The patient has a decreased ejection fraction of 35%. He appears to be clinically euvolemic and adequately diuresed. 
3. Nutrition: The patient is at high risk for aspiration, which may be causing multifocal pneumonia. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is planned.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is likely due to infection, but it has improved over the past 24 hours.
5. Right hip bleed: The patient had a hip bleed due to recent surgery and anticoagulation, but it is stable and resolving.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient had"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and had post-operative complications including NSTEMI, mitral regurgitation, two stents to the left coronary artery, and the need for a balloon pump. The patient also had a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, the patient is more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam but still has a fever. It is likely that the pneumonia was not completely cleared, along with recurrent aspiration. The white blood cell count is trending down, and the patient has been afebrile for over 72 hours. The plan is to restart vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, add levofloxacin for double gram-negative coverage, and then discontinue vancomycin and levofloxacin while continuing piperacillin/tazobactam to complete the course if tolerated.

2. Chest Pain and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's ejection fraction is 35%, indicating some degree of heart failure. The patient is being diuresed and seems clinically euvolemic. It is recommended to continue metoprolol, monitor intake and output with a goal of keeping it even to 500cc negative today, and hold ace inhibitors for marginal blood pressure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative complications such as NSTEMI, mitral regurgitation (MR), pneumonia (VAP), and a right hip bleed. The patient's current condition is more medically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent aspiration: The patient has a high suspicion of aspiration causing multifocal pneumonia. This may lead to further respiratory infections and worsening respiratory function.
2. Unresolving pneumonia: The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam but still has persistent fever and white blood cell count trending down. There is a need to monitor for any signs of ongoing infection and consider additional treatments if necessary.
3. CHF and new MR: The patient's ejection fraction is 35%, indicating some degree of heart failure. The patient is being diuresed and seems clinically euvolemic. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is necessary.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely due to infection. It has improved over the past 24 hours. Continued monitoring and management of the patient's heart rate are essential.
5. R hip bleed: The patient experienced a hip bleed due to recent surgery and anticoagulation. This has stabilized and is resolving. However, close monitoring of the patient's bleeding parameters is still necessary.
6. CAD: The patient had a NSTEMI after hip surgery and underwent stenting of the left circumflex artery. Ongoing management of the patient's cardiovascular status is crucial.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation but is currently in sinus rhythm. Monitoring for any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and appropriate management are important.

Overall, the patient's medical stability has improved, but there are several potential complications that require close monitoring and appropriate management."

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative complications including NSTEMI with a new mitral regurgitation (MR), two DES to the left coronary artery, and required a balloon pump. The patient also had pneumonia and a right hip bleed, but is now more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been on antibiotics for 8 days and is showing improvement with a decreasing white blood cell count and absence of fever for over 72 hours. However, the pneumonia may not have been completely cleared, and there is a suspicion of recurrent aspiration. The plan is to discontinue vancomycin and levofloxacin, continue zosyn, and perform chest PT, follow-up blood cultures, urine culture, sputum culture, and monitor CXRs every other day to assess interval improvement.

2. CHF and new MR: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction of 35% and is being diuresed. The patient seems clinically euvolemic, and the plan is to continue metoprolol, follow input/output measurements with a goal of keeping even to 500cc negative today, and hold ace for marginal blood pressure.

3. Nutrition: The patient has been NPO (nothing by mouth) due to the suspicion of aspiration causing multifocal pneumonia. It is recommended to start tube feeds via PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative complications including NSTEMI with a new mitral regurgitation (MR), 2 DES to the left coronary artery, and required a balloon pump. The patient also had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed. 

The patient's current condition is described as more medically stable. The assessment includes pneumonia, CHF, and new MR. The pneumonia has been treated with an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and the patient is afebrile for over 72 hours. The white blood cell count is trending down, indicating improvement. The plan is to discontinue vancomycin and levofloxacin and continue with piperacillin/tazobactam to complete the course. 

For CHF and new MR, the patient is being diuresed and seems clinically euvolemic. Metoprolol will be continued, and the goal is to keep intake and output (I/Os) even at 500cc negative today. The medication ace is being held due to marginal blood pressure.

Nutritionally, the patient is NPO but receiving tube feeds via PEG due to high suspicion of aspiration causing multifocal pneumonia. 

The patient's tachycardia is likely from infection but has improved over the past 24 hours. Metoprol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of heart failure, systolic, acute, and aortic stenosis. He was admitted to the ICU with recurrent aspiration, pneumonia (ventilator-acquired), and acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with delirium/confusion, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired knowledge, impaired muscle performance, impaired range of motion, impaired transfers, impaired ventilation, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (ventilator-acquired): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and production of purulent secretions is essential.
2. Delirium/confusion: Delirium is common in critically ill patients, especially those on mechanical ventilation. It can lead to increased agitation, disorientation, and potential falls. Frequent assessment of mental status and appropriate sedation management are necessary.
3. Impaired ventilatory function: The patient's impaired ventilation suggests possible respiratory muscle weakness or diaphragmatic dysfunction. Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging, and careful monitoring of respiratory parameters is required.
4. Skin integrity issues: Prolonged bed rest and immobility can result in pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and skin assessment are crucial to prevent and manage any skin integrity problems.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia. Further investigation into the cause of anemia is needed, and appropriate management should be implemented to address this issue.
6. Myocardial infarction: The patient's recent STEMI indicates a high risk for further cardiac complications. Continuous monitoring of cardiac enzymes and close collaboration with cardiology services are necessary to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction.
7. Heart failure exacerbation: Given the patient's history of heart failure and current acute exacerbation, careful monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and cardiac function is essential to prevent further deterioration.

It is important to note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information. Additional clinical findings and investigations may reveal further complications or modify the existing ones."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative complications, including a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and a new mitral regurgitation (MR). He required the use of a balloon pump due to his condition. The patient also had a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed. He has shown improvement in his medical stability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia was initially treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for 8 days. However, the patient's fever persisted, suggesting that the infection may not have been completely cleared. There is a concern about aspiration as a possible cause of the pneumonia. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, indicating improvement. The patient was restarted on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, with the addition of levofloxacin for double coverage against gram-negative bacteria. Further diagnostic tests, such as a chest X-ray, blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture, are recommended to monitor the progress. The patient should also be monitored closely for any signs of unresolving pneumonia, and an infectious disease and pulmonary consult may be necessary.

2. CHF and new MR: The patient's ejection fraction is at 35%, indicating some degree of heart failure (CHF). The patient has"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery and post-operative NSTEMI, who also had a new mitral regurgitation (MR) with two drug-eluting stents placed in the left circumflex artery and required a balloon pump. The patient's course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed. The patient is now more medically stable.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The last fever was on day 4 at 100.8. It is likely due to recurrent aspiration. White blood cell count has normalized.
   - Stop levofloxacin today
   - Continue zosyn for now, to complete 8-day course
   - Chest X-ray, sputum culture
   - NPO with tube feeds via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)
2. CHF and new MR: The patient's ejection fraction is 35%. The patient is being diuresed and appears clinically euvolemic.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Follow intake/output (I/O) goals to keep even today
   - Holding ACE inhibitor due to marginal blood pressure
3. Nutrition: The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving tube feeds with a high suspicion of"

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery, post-operative NSTEMI, and new mitral regurgitation (MR) with two drug-eluting stents placed in the left coronary artery and required a balloon pump. The patient's condition has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, the patient is more medically stable.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's last fever was 100.8 on [**4-3**]. It is likely that the pneumonia is due to incomplete clearing of previous pneumonia as well as recurrent aspiration. The white blood cell count continues to trend down, and the patient has been afebrile for more than 72 hours.
- Discontinue vancomycin per ID recommendations, then discontinue levofloxacin and continue piperacillin/tazobactam to complete the course if tolerated.
- Chest PT
- Follow-up blood cultures
- Follow-up urine culture
- Follow-up sputum culture
- Monitor CXRs every other day for interval improvement
- Appreciate ID and pulmonary recommendations for unresolving pneumonia
- NPO

2. CHF and new MR: The patient's ejection fraction is 35%. The patient is being diuresed and appears clinically euvolemic"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative complications including NSTEMI, new mitral regurgitation (MR), and required a balloon pump. He also had ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed. Currently, the patient is more medically stable but still faces several ongoing issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam but is likely experiencing recurrent aspiration, leading to multifocal pneumonia. Further treatment and cultures are recommended.
2. CHF and new MR: The patient's ejection fraction is at 35%, indicating some degree of heart failure. Diuretics are being used to manage fluid balance, and the patient's condition appears clinically euvolemic. Continuing metoprolol and monitoring input/output is advised.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains in the 90s, primarily due to infection, with occasional PVCs and PACs. Metoprolol therapy should be continued, and if tolerated in the future, the dose may be increased.
4. R hip bleed: The bleeding is stable and resolving, likely due to recent surgery and anticoagulation. Prophylactic measures such as folic acid and continued low molecular weight heparin should be maintained.
5. Atrial fibrillation: Although the patient's heart"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and post-operative NSTEMI with new mitral regurgitation (MR) and 2 DES (drug-eluting stents) to the left coronary artery, requiring a balloon pump. The patient's course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed, but is now more medically stable.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Although the patient is afebrile for over 72 hours, there is a possibility of recurrent aspiration leading to multifocal pneumonia. Monitoring chest X-rays every other day, following ID and pulmonary recommendations, and obtaining cultures are necessary.

2. CHF and new MR: The patient's ejection fraction is 35%, indicating reduced cardiac function. Diuretics are being used, and the patient seems clinically euvolemic. However, there is a risk of worsening heart failure and fluid overload. Close monitoring of intake and output (I/Os) with the goal of keeping even to 500cc negative today is recommended.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely due to infection but has improved over the past 24 hours. Continuing metoprolol at a dose of 25"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery and post-operative ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He has been experiencing multiple medical complications including new mitral regurgitation (MR), two distal embolizations to the left coronary artery, and the requirement for a balloon pump. The patient also had a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed, which is now resolving.

The patient's current condition is more medically stable, but he still presents with hypoxia likely related to resolving aspiration pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, and fluid overload. His fever has normalized, and he has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

The plan moving forward includes stopping levofloxacin today, continuing zosyn for another 2 days, and continuing atrovent nebs. The patient will undergo a chest PT and IS, as well as follow-up cultures. He will remain NPO with tube feeds via PEG due to a high suspicion of aspiration causing multifocal pneumonia.

In terms of heart failure and new MR, the patient's ejection fraction is 35%, and he is being diuresed and appears clinically euvolemic. Metoprolol will be continued, and efforts will be made to keep his intake and output even today. The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and holding ace"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with R hip surgery and post-op STEMI with new MR with 2 DES
   to Lcx and required balloon pump, course complicatd by VAP and R hip
   bleed, now more medically stable.
   Hypoxia: Likely related to resolving aspiration pneumonia, aspiration
   pneumonitis, fluid overload, all of which are improving. Finished 8 day
   course of vanc/zosyn already.  Last fever [**4-3**] 100.8.  Likely due to
   recurrent aspiration. White count normalized.
   - Stop levoflox today
   - Continue zosyn for now, to complete 10 day course on [**2153-4-11**]
   - continue atrovent nebs
   - chest PT, IS
   - f/u cultures
   - Appreciate ID and pulmonary recs
   - NPO with TF via PEG
   CHF and new MR: EF 35%.  Diuresing and seems clinically euvolemic.
   - continue metoprolol
   - follow I/Os with goal to keep even today
   - holding ace for marginal BP
   Nutrition: Patient NPO getting tube feeds with high suspicion of
   aspiration causing multifocal pneumonia.
   - Cont TFs via PEG
   - follow-up with nutrition regarding increased tube feeds due to
   patient
s hunger
   Tachycardia.  Likely from infection, HR mainly in 90s. Still with PVCs,
   PACs.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO tid. No room to increase now due to BP,
   but consider in future if tolerates.
   R hip bleed. Stable and resolving.  From recent surgery and
   anticoagulation.
   - folic acid daily
   - continue prophylactic dose Lovenox
   Atrial fibrillation. Currently sinus, although brief run Afib
   yesterday.
   - restarted coumadin; keep lovenox for bridge
   - continue metoprolol
   CAD: Nstemi after hip surgery s/p DES to Lcx x 2.
   - continue asa, plavix, lipitor,  metoprolol
   - continue to hold captopril and consider restarting tomorrow after
   increase tube feeds and flushes today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced a post-operative STEMI with new mitral regurgitation (MR) requiring a balloon pump. The patient's course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed. The patient is now more medically stable.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxia, likely due to resolving aspiration pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, and fluid overload, all of which are improving. The patient's fever has resolved, and their white blood cell count has normalized.

The plan includes stopping levofloxacin today, continuing zosyn for now, and completing a 10-day course on [**2153-4-11**]. The patient will continue receiving atrovent nebs, and a chest PT and IS are recommended. Follow-up cultures are also advised.

Regarding the patient's congestive heart failure (CHF) and new MR, the patient has an ejection fraction (EF) of 35%. The patient is being diuresed and seems clinically euvolemic. It is recommended to continue metoprolol, follow intake and output (I/Os), and keep the patient even today.

Nutritionally, the patient is NPO but receiving tube feeds via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). There is a high suspicion of aspiration causing multifocal pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various health issues. The note mentions several potential medical complications that can arise. 

Firstly, the patient has a pleural effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the space between the lungs and the chest wall. This can potentially lead to respiratory problems and decreased oxygenation.

Secondly, the patient has impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, knowledge, muscle performance, range of motion, transfers, ventilation, and impaired skin integrity. These impairments may indicate a decline in physical function and overall health status.

Thirdly, the patient is experiencing delirium/confusion, which can be a result of multiple factors such as medication side effects, infection, or organ dysfunction.

Fourthly, the patient has an alteration in nutrition, which may contribute to overall poor health and delayed healing.

Fifthly, the patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, which is a bacterial infection acquired while on mechanical ventilation (ventilator-acquired pneumonia or VAP). This is a serious complication and requires prompt treatment to prevent further deterioration.

Sixthly, the patient has a history of heart failure (CHF), specifically acute systolic heart failure. This condition can significantly impact the patient's cardiac function and overall well-being.

Seventhly, the patient has atrial fibrillation (AFIB), a type of irregular heart rhythm that can increase the risk of blood clots and stroke.

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of heart failure, systolic, acute, and aortic stenosis. He is currently receiving multiple medications including levaquin, coumadin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/51 mmHg to 106/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has decreased from 101.5 kg at admission to 95.8 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an input of 642 mL and output of 1290 mL since midnight, resulting in a negative balance of -648 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with an ABG result of ///36/. Physical examination reveals scattered crackles bilaterally, improved aeration, and evidence of right thigh swelling.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 10.0 to 13.5 thousand/mm³, anemia with a Hct level ranging from 26.2% to 27.9%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count ranging from 274 to 309 thousand/mm³, elevated serum creatinine of 0."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery and post-operative non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) who also has a new mitral regurgitation (MR) and two drug-eluting stents (DES) placed in the left coronary artery. He required the use of a balloon pump and has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. The patient is currently more medically stable.

Assessment and Plan:
- Pneumonia: The patient has completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. His last fever was 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit, which is likely due to recurrent aspiration. His white blood cell count has normalized. It is recommended to stop levofloxacin today, continue zosyn for now to complete an 8-day course, perform a chest X-ray, obtain sputum cultures, follow up with infectious disease and pulmonary recommendations, and keep the patient nil per os (NPO) with tube feeds via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).
- CHF and new MR: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 35%. He is being diuresed and appears clinically euvolemic. It is recommended to continue metoprolol, follow input/output (I/O) goals to keep even today, and hold ace for"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Nutrition consulted and suggested increasing TFs to cycle 120ml/hr
   for 18 hours per day, then off at night to prevent hunger but since not
   eating decided no need to cycle so just increased goal to 120ml/hr with
   increased free water boluses as sodium slightly high.
   - Was 300mL positive at ~4pm so got 40mg IV lasix to keep more even in
   setting of increasing the tube feeds and put out >600mL but then was
   still positive (they werent adding in the 100mL free water flushes Q6H)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and subsequently experienced a post-operative STEMI with new mitral regurgitation (MR) requiring balloon pump support. The patient's course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed, but is now more medically stable.

The patient's current complaints are related to hypoxia, likely due to resolving aspiration pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, and fluid overload, all of which are improving. The patient's fever has resolved, and their white blood cell count has normalized.

The patient's assessment includes the following:
- Hypoxia: Likely related to resolving aspiration pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, and fluid overload, all of which are improving. The patient is no longer febrile, and their white blood cell count has normalized.
- CHF and new MR: The patient's ejection fraction is 35%, and they are being diuresed and seem clinically euvolemic.
- Tachycardia: Likely from infection, with a heart rate mainly in the 90s and occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and pacemaker beats.
- R hip bleed: Stable and resolving, caused by recent surgery and anticoagulation.
- Atrial fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm, although there was a brief run of atrial fibrillation yesterday.
- CAD: Experienced NSTE MI after hip surgery, status post double"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery and post-operative STEMI. He has new mitral regurgitation and 2 DES to the left coronary artery, requiring balloon pump support. The patient's course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, the patient is more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient may experience hypoxia due to resolving aspiration pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, or fluid overload. These conditions are improving, but it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's oxygen levels and adjusting treatment accordingly.

2. Recurrent Aspiration: The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration, which can lead to further respiratory complications. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and ensuring proper positioning and secretion management is crucial.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient may have fluid overload due to increased tube feeds and free water flushes. This can contribute to pulmonary edema and worsening cardiac function. Monitoring fluid balance and adjusting diuretic therapy as needed is essential.

4. CHF and New MR: The patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF 35%) and new mitral regurgitation. This can lead to congestive heart failure (CHF) symptoms such as dyspnea and edema. Close monitoring of the patient's fluid status, diuresis, and cardiac function is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with R hip surgery and post-op STEMI with new MR with 2 DES
   to Lcx and required balloon pump, course complicatd by VAP and R hip
   bleed, now more medically stable.
   Hypoxia: Likely related to resolving aspiration pneumonia, aspiration
   pneumonitis, fluid overload, all of which are improving. Finished 8 day
   course of vanc/zosyn already, plan to continue for 10 days.  Last fever
   [**4-3**] 100.8.  Likely due to recurrent aspiration. White count
   normalized.
   - Stopped levoflox
   - Continue zosyn for now, to complete 10 day course on [**2153-4-11**]
   - continue atrovent nebs
   - chest PT, IS
   - f/u cultures
   - NPO with TF via PEG
   CHF and new MR: EF 35%.  Pt was volume positive yesterday given
   increase in TFs and free water flushes.  Diuresed with lasix 40mg X2
   yesterday.  Currently mildly volume positive.
   - continue to diurese with goal to be even today
   - continue metoprolol
   - follow I/Os
   - held ace given history of hypotension when restarted in the past,
   consider restarting when BP more stable after gentle diuresis
   Nutrition: Patient NPO getting tube feeds with high suspicion of
   aspiration causing multifocal pneumonia.
   - Cont TFs via PEG
   - Nutrition recommended cycling tube feeds at 120cc/hr, however nursing
   concern about not making it continuous, therefore will confirm with
   nutrition today.  In the meantime keep on 120cc/hr continuous with free
   water flushes of 50cc Q6H.
   - try to d/c K in TFs as on coumadin
   Tachycardia.  Likely from infection, HR mainly in 90s. Still with
   frequent PVCs, PACs.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO tid. No room to increase now due to BP,
   but consider in future if tolerates.
   R hip bleed. Stable and resolving.  From recent surgery and
   anticoagulation.  Hct stable.
   - folic acid daily
   - continue prophylactic dose Lovenox
   Atrial fibrillation. Currently sinus.
   - restarted coumadin; keep lovenox for bridge, INR 1.5 today, will
   follow daily and decrease K in TFs as above
   - when therapeutic INR, will decrease aspirin to 81mg.
   - continue metoprolol
   CAD: Nstemi after hip surgery s/p DES to Lcx x 2.
   - continue asa, plavix, lipitor,  metoprolol
   - continue to hold captopril and consider restarting tomorrow after
   increase tube feeds and flushes today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of right hip surgery and post-operative STEMI. He has been diagnosed with new mitral regurgitation (MR) and two distal embolizations (DES) to the left coronary artery, requiring balloon pump support. His course has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and right hip bleed. Currently, he is more medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient may continue to experience hypoxia due to resolving aspiration pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, and fluid overload. The plan is to continue with the current treatment regimen and monitor his oxygenation levels.
2. CHF and new MR: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 35%, indicating congestive heart failure (CHF). With the increase in tube feeds and free water flushes, he is mildly volume positive. Diuresis with lasix will be continued to manage fluid overload and aim for an even fluid balance today.
3. Nutrition: The patient is at risk of aspiration due to his nasogastric (NG) tube feeding. Nutrition consultation recommends cycling tube feeds at 120cc/hr, but nursing concerns need to be addressed. The plan is to continue with TFs via PEG and ensure adequate nutrition while minimizing the risk of aspiration.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate remains in the 90s, likely"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Nutrition consulted and suggested increasing TFs to cycle 120ml/hr
   for 18 hours per day, then off at night to prevent hunger but since not
   eating decided no need to cycle so just increased goal to 120ml/hr with
   increased free water boluses as sodium slightly high.
   - Was 300mL positive at ~4pm so got 40mg IV lasix to keep more even in
   setting of increasing the tube feeds and put out >600mL but then was
   still positive (they werent adding in the 100mL free water flushes Q6H)

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with R hip surgery and post-op STEMI with new MR with 2 DES
   to Lcx and required balloon pump, course complicatd by VAP and R hip
   bleed, now more medically stable.
   Hypoxia: Likely related to resolving aspiration pneumonia, aspiration
   pneumonitis, fluid overload, all of which are improving. Finished 8 day
   course of vanc/zosyn already, plan to continue for 10 days.  Last fever
   [**4-3**] 100.8.  Likely due to recurrent aspiration. White count
   normalized.
   - Stopped levoflox
   - Continue zosyn for now, to complete 10 day course on [**2153-4-11**]
   - continue atrovent nebs
   - chest PT, IS
   - f/u cultures
   - NPO with TF via PEG
   CHF and new MR: EF 35%.  Pt was volume positive yesterday given
   increase in TFs and free water flushes.  Diuresed with lasix 40mg X2
   yesterday.  Currently mildly volume positive.
   - continue to diurese with goal to be even today
   - continue metoprolol
   - follow I/Os
   - held ace given history of hypotension when restarted in the past,
   consider restarting when BP more stable after gentle diuresis
   Nutrition: Patient NPO getting tube feeds with high suspicion of
   aspiration causing multifocal pneumonia.
   - Cont TFs via PEG
   - Nutrition recommended cycling tube feeds at 120cc/hr, however nursing
   concern about not making it continuous, therefore will confirm with
   nutrition today.  In the meantime keep on 120cc/hr continuous with free
   water flushes of 50cc Q6H.
   - try to d/c K in TFs as on coumadin
   Tachycardia.  Likely from infection, HR mainly in 90s. Still with
   frequent PVCs, PACs.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO tid. No room to increase now due to BP,
   but consider in future if tolerates.
   R hip bleed. Stable and resolving.  From recent surgery and
   anticoagulation.  Hct stable.
   - folic acid daily
   - continue prophylactic dose Lovenox
   Atrial fibrillation. Currently sinus.
   - restarted coumadin; keep lovenox for bridge, INR 1.5 today, will
   follow daily and decrease K in TFs as above
   - when therapeutic INR, will decrease aspirin to 81mg.
   - continue metoprolol
   CAD: Nstemi after hip surgery s/p DES to Lcx x 2.
   - continue asa, plavix, lipitor,  metoprolol
   - continue to hold captopril and consider restarting tomorrow after
   increase tube feeds and flushes today

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male who underwent right hip surgery and experienced post-operative complications including a STEMI, new mitral regurgitation (MR), two distal embolizations to the left coronary artery, and the need for a balloon pump. The patient also had a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a right hip bleed. The patient is currently more medically stable but still faces several medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely related to resolving aspiration pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, and fluid overload. These conditions are improving, but the patient may still experience some respiratory difficulties.
2. CHF and new MR: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 35%, indicating heart failure. The patient was volume positive yesterday due to increased tube feeds and free water flushes. Diuretics were used to manage fluid overload, and the goal is to maintain even fluid balance today.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is mostly in the 90s with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and atrial premature contractions (PACs). This could be due to infection or other causes.
4. R hip bleed: The patient had a hip bleed due to recent surgery and anticoagulation. The bleed is stable and resolving.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient previously experienced atrial fibrillation but is currently"
188583.0,217050,2153-04-10 06:07:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Nutrition consulted and suggested increasing TFs to cycle 120ml/hr
   for 18 hours per day, then off at night to prevent hunger but since not
   eating decided no need to cycle so just increased goal to 120ml/hr with
   increased free water boluses as sodium slightly high.
   - Was 300mL positive at ~4pm so got 40mg IV lasix to keep more even in
   setting of increasing the tube feeds and put out >600mL but then was
   still positive (they werent adding in the 100mL free water flushes Q6H)
   so gave another 40mg IV lasix.

","Summary:
The patient is a 101.5 kg, 70-inch male with a chief complaint of a pleural effusion. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C (98.5 F), a heart rate of 77 bpm, a blood pressure of 89/44 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving nutrition through tube feeds at a rate of 120 mL/hr and has been given free water boluses to prevent hunger. The patient was given 40 mg of IV lasix to manage fluid balance, but there is still a positive fluid balance. The patient has allergies to no known drugs and has received antibiotics for suspected bacterial pneumonia. The patient is on multiple medications including enoxaparin (Lovenox) and furosemide (Lasix). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus rhythm with stable vital signs. The patient's fluid balance has been negative, indicating a loss of fluids. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula with a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's peripheral vascular examination reveals no pulses in the right radial, left radial, right DP, and left DP. The patient's neurologic examination is also not assessed.
