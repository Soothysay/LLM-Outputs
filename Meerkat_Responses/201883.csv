","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who has undergone ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement and aneurysm clipping. She presents with headaches and unsteadiness, and multiple hemorrhagic brain masses are found, which are likely metastatic lung cancer. The patient has a known allergy to folic acid and received ciprofloxacin antibiotics on [2106-1-28] at 02:38 AM. She is currently on various medications in the ICU, including regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:

1. Seizures: The presence of hemorrhagic brain masses and previous seizure history increases the risk of recurrent seizures.

2. Respiratory distress: If the lung cancer has spread to the respiratory system or if there is any compromise in lung function due to the brain masses, it can lead to respiratory distress.

3. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to cancer and ongoing medical interventions, making her susceptible to infections.

4. Bleeding: With a history of SAH and current hemorrhagic brain masses, there is an increased risk of bleeding within the central nervous system.

5. Thromboembolic events: Prolonged immobility in the ICU and malignancy are risk factors for developing deep vein"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Hemorrhagic brain mets, cerebral edema, ?h/o seizure
   Likely mets from lung CA, although awaiting pathology report from lymph
   node biopsy. Plan for WBI today.
   --Appreciate neurology and neurosurgery recommendations.
   --Target SBP 120-140 (treat with IV lopressor as required to maintain
   in this range), keep PCO2<40, elevate head of bed to 30 degrees
   --Continue mannitol, hold Na>152 and serum Osm >320. Check Na, Osm q6
   hours for now.
   --Continue steroids, consider repeat head CT to reassess edema
   --Continue dilantin for seizure ppx, check level today, continue
   seizure precautions.
   2. Lung mass
   Suspect small cell lung cancer but await pathology.
   Consult oncology, palliative care and social work consults.
   3. Stridor
   Resolved. Tx with racemic epi post extubation. Review of CT scan shows
   bulky disease in mediastinum with tracheal narrowing. Follow
   respiratory status closely. Currently maintaining adequate O2 sats.
   4. Elevated cardiac enzymes
   Elevated at admission, trended down. Most likely demand ischemia,
   NSTEMI possible. No antiplatelet/anticoagulation given cerebral mets.
   Continue beta blocker as BP tolerates, continue statin.
   5. UTI
   Patient has foley, consider D/C when mannitol discontinued. Treat with
   cipro x2 weeks given foley.
   6. DM
   Continue insulin sliding scale, keep glucose<150

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who presents with headaches and unsteadiness. Multiple hemorrhagic brain masses are likely metastatic lung cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/69 mmHg to 160/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications that need attention. First, there is concern for cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the hemorrhagic brain masses. The plan is to perform whole brain irradiation (WBI) today and maintain the head of the bed elevated at 30 degrees. Mannitol will be continued to reduce ICP, and sodium and serum osmolarity will be monitored closely.

Second, the patient has a suspected lung mass, possibly small cell lung cancer. Oncology, palliative care, and social work consults have been requested.

Third, the patient experienced stridor post-extubation, which resolved with racemic epinephrine. There is bulky disease in the mediastinum with tracheal narrowing seen on the CT scan, so respiratory status will be closely monitored.

Fourth, the patient had elevated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old woman with a likely diagnosis of disseminated malignancy, possibly small cell lung cancer (SCLC). She has multiple medical complications including subarachnoid hemorrhage with increased intracranial pressure, seizure disorder, stridor due to tracheal narrowing, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's altered mental status and stridor indicate potential respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and airway patency is necessary.
2. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage suggests increased ICP. Monitoring for signs of elevated ICP, such as changes in consciousness, pupillary response, and respiratory patterns, is crucial.
3. Seizure Activity: The patient's seizure disorder requires close monitoring for recurrent seizures. Administering antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and maintaining appropriate serum levels are important.
4. Cardiac Ischemia/Infarction: The patient's NSTEMI and elevated cardiac enzymes indicate cardiac ischemia. Managing the patient's blood pressure, providing antiplatelet therapy, and initiating statin therapy are essential.
5. Malignancy Progression: Given the patient's likely diagnosis of SCLC, there is a risk of malignancy progression. Consultation with medical oncology and planning for brain irradi"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Hemorrhagic brain mets, cerebral edema, ?h/o seizure
   Likely mets from lung CA, although awaiting pathology report from lymph
   node biopsy. CT head [**1-28**] without significant change, no worsening of
   edema. Now s/p 2nd (this AM) of 10 planned WBI treatments.
   --Appreciate neurology and neurosurgery recommendations.
   --Target SBP 120-140 (treat with IV lopressor as required to maintain
   in this range), keep PCO2<40, elevate head of bed to 30 degrees to
   minimize increase in ICP
   --Continue mannitol, hold Na>152 and serum Osm >320. Check Na, Osm q6
   hours for now. D/w neuro whether mannitol still required as in setting
   of radiation could lead to increased cerebral edema.
   --Continue steroids
   --Continue dilantin for seizure ppx, check trough [**1-30**], continue
   seizure precautions.
   --Contact family for further information regarding baseline mental
   status
   2. Lung mass
   Suspect small cell lung cancer but await pathology.
   Consult oncology, palliative care and social work consults pending
   pathology report.
   3. Stridor
   Resolved. Tx with racemic epi post extubation. Review of CT scan shows
   bulky disease in mediastinum with tracheal narrowing. Follow
   respiratory status closely. Maintaining adequate O2 sats.
   4. Elevated cardiac enzymes at admission
   Elevated at admission, trended down. Most likely demand ischemia,
   NSTEMI possible. No antiplatelet/anticoagulation given cerebral mets.
   Continue beta blocker as BP tolerates, continue statin.
   Repeat EKG today ?of ST changes on monitor. If new ischemia would
   medically manage, patient would be high risk for PCI and is not a
   surgical candidate.
   5. UTI
   Patient has foley, consider D/C when mannitol discontinued. Treat with
   ampicillin complete 2 week course (shorter if foley can be
   discontinued). Change from quinolone given risk of lowering seizure
   threshold with quinolone.
   6. DM
   Continue insulin sliding scale, keep glucose<150

   Critical Care Staff Addendum
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan, and would add/emphasize:
   Brain metastases/ICH -- Ms. [**Known lastname 886**] has tolerated her initial round of
   brain irradiation without apparent complications.  We will discuss the
   course of mannitol with neurology, but suspect that we should begin to
   taper or discontinue it.  Keep therapeutic on AED.
   Stridor -- has resolved.
   Malignancy --  We are awaiting pathology on her lymph node, but suspect
   small cell lung cancer.  Will consult oncology once pathology is back.
   Nutrition

   UTI
 convert to ampicillin since quinolone may increase seizure risk.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with multiple hemorrhagic brain masses suspected to be metastases from lung cancer. She has undergone whole brain radiation therapy and is currently being treated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure range of 150/73-169/104 mmHg and a heart rate range of 99-108 bpm. She is breathing at a rate of 15-21 breaths per minute and has an oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's neurological examination shows brisk symmetric deep tendon reflexes and variable attention. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly elevated potassium and magnesium levels. Blood glucose levels are also within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal no significant change in the brain since the last CT scan.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hemorrhagic brain mets, cerebral edema, and possible history of seizure: The patient is receiving treatment for cerebral edema, including elevating the head of the bed and administering mannitol. Neurology and neurosurgery recommendations are appreciated, and the target systolic blood pressure range is 120-140 mmHg. The patient will continue to receive steroids, dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and seizure precautions.

2. Lung mass: The patient's lung mass is suspected to be small cell"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with suspected multiple hemorrhagic brain masses and a primary lung cancer. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has several medical complications and conditions.

1. Hemorrhagic brain mets, cerebral edema, and potential seizure history: The patient's brain masses are likely metastases from her lung cancer. Cerebral edema is present, but there has been no significant change in the CT head scans. The patient has been started on whole brain radiation therapy (WBI) and will receive a total of 10 treatments. Neurological recommendations include maintaining a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 120-140, keeping partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) below 40, elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees, continuing mannitol, holding sodium levels above 152 and serum osmolarity above 320, checking these levels every 6 hours for now, continuing steroids, and implementing seizure precautions.

2. Lung mass: The patient has a lung mass that is suspected to be small cell lung cancer, but a pathology report is still pending. Consultations with oncology, palliative care, and social work have been requested.

3. Stridor: The patient had stridor, which resolved after treatment with racemic epinephrine post-extubation. A CT scan showed bulky disease in the mediastinum with tracheal narrowing."

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Hemorrhagic brain mets, cerebral edema, ?h/o seizure
   Likely mets from lung CA, although awaiting pathology report from lymph
   node biopsy. CT head [**1-28**] without significant change, no worsening of
   edema. Now s/p 2nd (this AM) of 10 planned WBI treatments.
   --Appreciate neurology and neurosurgery recommendations.
   --Target SBP 120-140 (treat with IV lopressor as required to maintain
   in this range), keep PCO2<40, elevate head of bed to 30 degrees to
   minimize increase in ICP
   --Continue mannitol, hold Na>152 and serum Osm >320. Check Na, Osm q6
   hours for now. D/w neuro whether mannitol still required as in setting
   of radiation could lead to increased cerebral edema.
   --Continue steroids
   --Continue dilantin for seizure ppx, check trough [**1-30**], continue
   seizure precautions.
   --Contact family for further information regarding baseline mental
   status
   2. Lung mass
   Suspect small cell lung cancer but await pathology.
   Consult oncology, palliative care and social work consults pending
   pathology report.
   3. Stridor
   Resolved. Tx with racemic epi post extubation. Review of CT scan shows
   bulky disease in mediastinum with tracheal narrowing. Follow
   respiratory status closely. Maintaining adequate O2 sats.
   4. Elevated cardiac enzymes at admission
   Elevated at admission, trended down. Most likely demand ischemia,
   NSTEMI possible. No antiplatelet/anticoagulation given cerebral mets.
   Continue beta blocker as BP tolerates, continue statin.
   Repeat EKG today ?of ST changes on monitor. If new ischemia would
   medically manage, patient would be high risk for PCI and is not a
   surgical candidate.
   5. UTI
   Patient has foley, consider D/C when mannitol discontinued. Treat with
   ampicillin complete 2 week course (shorter if foley can be
   discontinued). Change from quinolone given risk of lowering seizure
   threshold with quinolone.
   6. DM
   Continue insulin sliding scale, keep glucose<150

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with suspected multiple hemorrhagic brain masses, possibly related to lung cancer. She has been receiving whole brain radiation therapy (WBI) and is currently in the ICU. Her vital signs are stable, but she has experienced some fluctuations in sodium and serum osmolarity levels. The patient's neurological examination shows variable attention, non-purposeful movement, and brisk symmetric deep tendon reflexes. She is responding to verbal stimuli and follows simple commands. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhagic brain mets: The presence of hemorrhagic brain masses can increase intracranial pressure (ICP) and lead to cerebral edema. The patient's head of bed has been elevated to 30 degrees, and mannitol has been administered to minimize the increase in ICP. Sodium and serum osmolarity levels will be closely monitored to prevent further increases in ICP.
2. Lung mass: The patient has a lung mass that is suspected to be small cell lung cancer. Further evaluation and management will be done once the pathology report is available. Consultations with oncology, palliative care, and social work are pending.
3. Stridor: The patient previously experienced stridor, which resolved after treatment with racemic epi post extubation. Close follow-up of respiratory status is recommended due to bulky disease in the mediastinum causing tracheal narrowing.
4. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient had elevated cardiac enzymes at admission, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Hemorrhagic brain mets, cerebral edema, ?h/o seizure
   Likely mets from lung CA, although awaiting pathology report from lymph
   node biopsy. CT head [**1-28**] without significant change, no worsening of
   edema. Now s/p 2nd (this AM) of 10 planned WBI treatments.
   --Appreciate neurology and neurosurgery recommendations.
   --Target SBP 120-140 (treat with IV lopressor as required to maintain
   in this range), keep PCO2<40, elevate head of bed to 30 degrees to
   minimize increase in ICP
   --Continue mannitol, hold Na>152 and serum Osm >320. Check Na, Osm q6
   hours for now. D/w neuro whether mannitol still required as in setting
   of radiation could lead to increased cerebral edema.
   --Continue steroids
   --Continue dilantin for seizure ppx, check trough [**1-30**], continue
   seizure precautions.
   --Contact family for further information regarding baseline mental
   status
   2. Lung mass
   Suspect small cell lung cancer but await pathology.
   Consult oncology, palliative care and social work consults pending
   pathology report.
   3. Stridor
   Resolved. Tx with racemic epi post extubation. Review of CT scan shows
   bulky disease in mediastinum with tracheal narrowing. Follow
   respiratory status closely. Maintaining adequate O2 sats.
   4. Elevated cardiac enzymes at admission
   Elevated at admission, trended down. Most likely demand ischemia,
   NSTEMI possible. No antiplatelet/anticoagulation given cerebral mets.
   Continue beta blocker as BP tolerates, continue statin.
   Repeat EKG today ?of ST changes on monitor. If new ischemia would
   medically manage, patient would be high risk for PCI and is not a
   surgical candidate.
   5. UTI
   Patient has foley, consider D/C when mannitol discontinued. Treat with
   ampicillin complete 2 week course (shorter if foley can be
   discontinued). Change from quinolone given risk of lowering seizure
   threshold with quinolone.
   6. DM
   Continue insulin sliding scale, keep glucose<150

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of extensive small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastasis. She experienced a seizure and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's mental status has improved today. She has multiple medical conditions, including urinary tract infection (UTI), cancer (malignant neoplasm), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), lymphadenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes), seizure, myocardial infarction (AMI), and cerebral edema. The patient is receiving various treatments and medications, such as radiation therapy, antibiotics, steroids, and antiepileptic drugs. She is also being monitored closely for cardiac enzymes and glucose levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's cancer diagnosis and the use of radiation therapy, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of extensive small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastasis. She experienced a seizure and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's mental status has improved today. She is being treated for a urinary tract infection with ampicillin. She is receiving radiation therapy for her cancer and will continue taking dexamethasone during XRT. Oncology is following her case. Neuro checks are being continued due to subarachnoid hemorrhage, and mannitol is being weaned off per neurosurgical recommendations. The patient has lymphadenopathy, and further evaluation is needed for her seizure, myocardial infarction, and cerebral edema. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is already on ampicillin for the UTI, which should help treat the infection. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis is important.
2. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), small cell: The patient has extensive SCLC with brain metastasis. Radiation therapy is being given to the brain. It is essential to monitor for any neurological changes or complications related to the cancer and its treatment.
3. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH): Neuro checks are being continued, and mannitol is being weaned off as per neurosurgical recommendations. Monitoring for any signs of increased intracranial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with metastatic small cell lung cancer who is currently undergoing XRT (X-ray therapy) in the ICU. She has multiple hemorrhagic CNS lesions and has experienced several medical complications, including stridor, elevated cardiac enzymes, UTI, DM, and potential seizure activity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemorrhagic brain mets: The patient has hemorrhagic CNS lesions, which are likely metastases from her small cell lung cancer. This could lead to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and neurological deterioration.
2. Cerebral edema: The patient's brain mets and potential seizures may be associated with cerebral edema, which can worsen ICP and compromise cerebral perfusion.
3. Seizure activity: The patient has had seizure precautions in place due to the risk of seizures related to her brain mets and potential cerebral edema.
4. Stridor: The patient previously experienced stridor, which resolved after treatment with racemic epi. This could recur if there is a recurrence of airway obstruction.
5. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient had elevated cardiac enzymes at admission, suggesting myocardial ischemia or NSTEMI. There is a risk of further cardiac events due to ongoing ischemia and poor functional status.
6. UTI: The patient has a Foley catheter in place, increasing the risk of urinary tract infection. Proper antibiotic treatment and catheter management are essential.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with metastatic small cell lung cancer who is currently undergoing XRT (radiotherapy) and presenting with multiple hemorrhagic CNS lesions. The patient's condition has been relatively stable without any major events over the past 24 hours. They have shown slight improvement in terms of wakefulness and interaction. The patient denies any pain and expresses hunger. There are no significant changes in their medical and family history, review of systems, or allergies.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/82 to 150/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's weight is currently 46 kg, and their height is 61 inches. The central venous pressure (CVP) is at 1 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,558 mL and output of 2,675 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 117 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen supplementation, and their ABG results are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears thin, with clear breath sounds and warm skin. Neurological examination shows the patient following simple commands, oriented to the hospital, and exhibiting tangential speech. Extremity pulses are absent on the right side and present on the left side."

   Resolved. Tx with racemic epi post extubation. Review of CT scan shows
   bulky disease in mediastinum with tracheal narrowing. Maintaining
   adequate O2 sats.
   4. Elevated cardiac enzymes at admission
   Elevated at admission, trended down. Most likely demand ischemia,
   NSTEMI possible. No antiplatelet/anticoagulation given cerebral mets.
   TWIs on EKG [**1-29**] be cerebral T

   secondary to recent myocardial ischemia.
   Continue beta blocker as BP tolerates, continue statin. Not a candidate
   for PCI or surgery.
   5. UTI
   D/C foley this afternoon post mannitol if possible. On ampicillin, can
   change to amoxicillin when able to take PO medications. Has already
   received 5 days of abx to which E coli was sensitive. Would complete
   14d course of abx for catheter associated UTI

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with metastatic small cell lung cancer and multiple hemorrhagic CNS lesions undergoing radiation therapy. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions and complications.

1. Hemorrhagic brain mets, cerebral edema, and seizure: The patient has hemorrhagic brain metastases, which is causing cerebral edema. The patient is being treated with steroids and mannitol to manage the edema. Seizure precautions are also being taken due to the possibility of seizures.

2. Lung mass: The patient has a lung mass that was confirmed to be small cell lung cancer. The patient is being followed by oncology and may not be a candidate for chemotherapy due to poor functional status. Palliative care recommendations are appreciated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a diagnosis of extensive small cell lung cancer. She was admitted with seizures and is currently improving from a mental status standpoint. 

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including urinary tract infection (UTI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), cerebral edema, lymphadenopathy, seizure, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 

The patient is receiving treatment for her conditions, including antibiotics for the UTI, steroids for the cerebral edema, and anticonvulsants for the seizure. She is also undergoing radiation therapy (XRT) for her cancer. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition is being provided through a trial of oral intake, although she pulled out the nasogastric tube. Her blood sugar levels are well-controlled with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line, which will be discontinued once peripheral lines are established. 

Preventive measures such as DVT prophylaxis with boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and VAP precautions are being implemented. The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor soon."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of extensive small cell lung cancer. She was admitted with seizures and is showing improvement in her mental status. The patient has several medical conditions, including urinary tract infection (UTI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), lymphadenopathy, seizure, and myocardial infarction (MI). She is currently receiving treatment for these conditions and is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral edema: The patient has been experiencing cerebral edema, which can potentially worsen and lead to increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status and adjustments in medication, such as continuing corticosteroids and considering additional interventions like hypertonic saline or surgical intervention, may be necessary to manage this complication.

2. Seizure: Although the patient's mental status is improving, she has a history of seizures. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of seizure activity and maintaining appropriate antiepileptic drug therapy to prevent further seizures.

3. Myocardial infarction: The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction, which can have long-term implications for her cardiac function. Regular monitoring of the patient's cardiovascular status and adherence to prescribed medications will be crucial in managing this complication.

4. Urinary tract infection: The patient has been treated for a urinary tract infection with ampicillin."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a diagnosis of extensive small cell lung cancer. She was admitted with seizures and is currently improving from a mental status standpoint. The patient has been on ampicillin for a urinary tract infection for a total of 7 days. She will receive XRT for her cancer, as she has already had 2 treatments.

The patient has several other medical conditions, including subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), cerebral edema, lymphadenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes), seizure without status epilepticus, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI/STEMI/NSTEMI). However, no anticoagulation is given due to the SAH, and the goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) is 120-140 due to cerebral edema. The ECG changes are likely due to increased intracranial pressure (ICP).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/66 mmHg to 150/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on respiratory support with an ABG reading of ///28/. She is also on various medications such as famotidine, Lipitor, Decadron, Dilantin, insulin sliding scale, and"
