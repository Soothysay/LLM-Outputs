   #. Seizures:
   Patient had question of seizure prior to presentation and additionally
   had a witnessed seizure in the ED and threee on [**12-7**] in ICU.. The ED
   was concerned for a withdrawal seizure; however, the time course
   appears to be too short after cessation of drinking for this. Also,
   patient not exhibiting florid signs of withdrawal prior to seizure in
   ICU as he was not anxious, not diaphoretic, and with minimal tremor.
   Most likely that his seizure threshold is simply markedly reduced
   surrounding time of alcohol intoxication and recovery. He has unknown
   level of seizure activity at baseline as he normally receives care at

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and seizure disorder. He presented to the emergency department after a likely seizure and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient had multiple seizures during the day, and neurology recommended loading with 10mg/kg IV Depakote and giving 2mg IV Ativan if he seizes again. The patient also has low magnesium levels, which were repleted.

The patient's medications include:

1. Lorazepam 1 mg IV once
2. Citalopram Hydrobromide 20 mg PO/NG daily
3. Diazepam 5 mg IV Q2H:PRN CIWA > 10 (use only if PO route not an option)

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 115/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological status is not assessed due to sedation.

The patient's lab results show normal levels for white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. However, the magnesium level is low at 2.0 mg/dL.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 399 mL and 902 mL since midnight.

The patient has been diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal and seizure disorder. The assessment plan includes educating the patient on seizure triggers, contacting an outpatient neurologist to further characterize the seizure history and clarify medication regimen, and following up on inpatient neurology recommendations regarding the Depakote level.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is resolving and does not suggest heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient will be monitored daily.

The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including regular diet as mental status allows, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with heparin subcutaneous, bowel regimen with senna and docusate, and communication with the patient. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to remain in the ICU for now."

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   47 yo M with history of seizure disorder and EtOH abuse brought to ED
   by EMS after likely seizure at shelter.
   #. Seizures:
   Patient had question of seizure prior to presentation and additionally
   had a witnessed seizure in the ED and threee on [**12-7**] in ICU.. The ED
   was concerned for a withdrawal seizure; however, the time course
   appears to be too short after cessation of drinking for this. Also,
   patient not exhibiting florid signs of withdrawal prior to seizure in
   ICU as he was not anxious, not diaphoretic, and with minimal tremor.
   Most likely that his seizure threshold is simply markedly reduced
   surrounding time of alcohol intoxication and recovery. He has unknown
   level of seizure activity at baseline as he normally receives care at
   [**Hospital1 587**], though he reports several seizures per month that are not
   temporally related to his alcohol intake. Patient was therapeutic on
   his phenytoin and his divalproex.
   - Educate on seizure triggers
   - Contact outpatient neurologist to further characterize seizure
   history and to clarify medication regimen
   - F/u inpatient neurology recs- unclear why Depakote level in range at
   admission but not now.
   .
   #. EtOH abuse:
   Patient reports that he occasionally attends AA meeting, though
   expresses no strong desire to quit drinking at this time. No concern
   for acute withdrawal as the time frame is not appropriate. Still is
   reasonable to monitor with CIWA
   - Q2H CIWA with diazepam for coverage
   - Social work consult
   - Case management for housing at discharge
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamins
   # thrombocytopenia: now resolving.  Was never more than 50% drop and
   timing and lack of thrombosis do not suggest HIT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and seizure disorder. He presented to the emergency department after a suspected seizure and was brought in by EMS. In the ICU, the patient experienced multiple seizures during the day, for which he was given IV Ativan. Neurology recommended a loading dose of 10mg/kg IV Depakote and advised to give 2mg IV Ativan if another seizure occurs, followed by starting 1mg po TID standing. The patient's magnesium level was low, so it was repleted. He ate a full lunch and dinner. Medical records from a previous hospital visit showed a few emergency department visits for seizures, treated with Ativan and sent out. The patient has no known drug allergies. He is currently on various medications including lorazepam, citalopram, diazepam, multivitamins, phenytoin sodium extended, divalproex, senna, sodium chloride flush, thiamine, and valproate sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has experienced multiple seizures, indicating a potential ongoing risk for further seizures. Appropriate management with antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and divalproex is in place.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: Although the patient is not currently exhibiting signs of acute alcohol withdrawal, monitoring with CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) should be continued due to his history"

   #. Seizures: Patient had question of seizure prior to presentation and
   additionally had a witnessed seizure in the ED and threee on [**12-7**] in
   ICU.. The ED was concerned for a withdrawal seizure; however, the time
   course appears to be too short after cessation of drinking for this.
   Also, patient not exhibiting florid signs of withdrawal prior to
   seizure in ICU as he was not anxious, not diaphoretic, and with minimal
   tremor. Most likely that his seizure threshold is simply markedly
   reduced surrounding time of alcohol intoxication and recovery. He has
   unknown level of seizure activity at baseline as he normally receives
   care at [**Hospital1 587**], though he reports several seizures per month that are not
   temporally related to his alcohol intake. Patient was therapeutic on
   his phenytoin and his divalproex.

   - Seizure precautions
   - Continue phenytoin 300mg daily and divalproex 500mg qAM and 1000mg

   #. EtOH abuse: Patient reports that he occasionally attends AA meeting,
   though expresses no strong desire to quit drinking at this time. No
   concern for acute withdrawal as the time frame is not appropriate.
   Still is reasonable to monitor with CIWA
   - Q2H CIWA with diazepam for coverage
   - Social work consult
   - Case management for housing at discharge
   - Thiamine, folate, multivitamins

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder and alcohol abuse. He presented to the Emergency Department after a likely seizure at a shelter. The patient has experienced multiple seizures, including one witnessed in the ICU. The seizures are not temporally related to alcohol intake, and the patient's seizure threshold may be reduced during periods of alcohol intoxication and recovery. The patient is currently on phenytoin and divalproex, but his phenytoin level is likely falsely low due to a valproic acid loading dose. Free phenytoin levels will be checked, and if low, an additional dose of 150 mg will be given. The patient's MRI head is pending, and he will undergo a 24-hour EEG. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and continues to experience them, indicating a need for ongoing seizure management and medication adjustment.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient initially presented with thrombocytopenia, which is now resolving. It is important to monitor the patient's platelet count regularly.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which could be due to poor oral intake of solutes or ADH regulation disturbances with recent seizures. It is crucial to encourage oral intake and monitor the patient's sodium levels daily.
4. Alcohol abuse: The patient has a history of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder and ethanol abuse. He presented to the emergency department after a likely seizure at a shelter and was brought in by EMS. Upon admission, the patient had a witnessed seizure in the emergency department and three more seizures on December 7th in the ICU. 

The patient's medical history includes a seizure disorder and ethanol abuse. He is currently being treated with phenytoin and divalproex for his seizure disorder. 

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but his blood pressure is slightly low. His heart rate and respiratory rate are within normal limits. His oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. 

The patient's physical examination shows no edema and his neurological examination reveals focal neuro deficits including left pronator drift. An MRI of the head was performed overnight, and the results are pending. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal limits. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low calcium level. Liver enzymes are mildly elevated, and kidney function is normal. 

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), ativan 1mg PO TID, phenytoin 300mg daily, and divalproex 500mg qAM and 1000mg qhs.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, who presented with seizures. The patient has a known underlying seizure disorder, with the seizure threshold possibly lowered by alcohol and dehydration. The patient has been seizure-free for 24 hours and has been educated about the role of alcohol in lowering the seizure threshold. The patient is currently on multiple anti-seizure medications, including depakote, dilantin, and ativan, at therapeutic levels. The patient's alcohol dependence is also being addressed with the help of social work services and CIWA scale. The patient's thrombocytopenia is improving, and hyponatremia may be related to the seizures. Further evaluation will be done if the hyponatremia declines, including sending osmols and urine electrolytes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a known seizure disorder and may experience further seizures due to underlying conditions or medication non-compliance.
2. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: The patient has alcohol dependence, and withdrawal symptoms can occur if alcohol intake is abruptly stopped. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal, such as tremors, agitation, and hallucinations, is important.
3. Thrombocytopenia: Although the patient's thrombocytopenia is improving, close monitoring of platelet levels is necessary to ensure that it does not worsen or lead to bleeding complications.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hypon"
