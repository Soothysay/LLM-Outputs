   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   1. Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.
   - Defer intubation for the time being, but started CPAP for comfort and
   to help with fatigue
   -Obtain ABG after one hour CPAP as marker for worsening
   hypercapnea/hypoxemia and possible support for intubation later
   - Supplemental oxygen to keep sat >90%
   - Continue treatment for PNA with vanc, but d/c Zosyn as has been on
   for 6 days with no improvement. D/c vanc tomorrow for same reason, but
   continue if worsens precipitously
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Quick prednisone taper (50 -> 40 -> 30 -> 20 -> 10 -> 0)
   - Will keep euvolemic for now
   - Review OSH chest CT with RADS and obtain high-res non-con CT chest
   today to assess for interval change
   - Sputum culture, if able
   - F/u ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **] here, and HIV from OSH
   - While on CPAP, use Ativan and morphine for agitation
   2. Leukocytosis. Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely
   contributors.
   3. Hypertension. Given possibility of intubation, will hold off on
   starting home meds now.
   4. Hyperlipidemia. Atorvastatin.
   5. Hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine.
   6. Anxiety. Klonopin.
   7. Depression. Imiprimine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female who was admitted for pneumonia (PNA) and is now presenting with hypoxia. She has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), indicated by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200, bilateral infiltrates of relatively acute onset, and no apparent elevated left filling pressures. The cause of ARDS is unclear, but potential differential diagnoses include interstitial pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia/COP, eosinophilic pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on CPAP for comfort and to help with fatigue, and an ABG will be obtained after one hour to assess for worsening hypercapnea/hypoxemia and possible support for intubation later. Supplemental oxygen will be provided to keep the patient's saturation above 90%. Antibiotic treatment for PNA will continue with vancomycin, but zosyn will be discontinued as it has been on for six days without improvement. Vancomycin will also be discontinued tomorrow for the same reason but will be continued if the patient worsens precipitously. Nebulizers will be used as needed, and a quick prednisone taper will be initiated. The patient's fluid status will be maintained euvolemic for now, and a review of the outpatient chest CT with radiology and a high-resolution non-contrast CT chest will be obtained today to assess for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. She presents with hypoxia, which meets criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to bilateral infiltrates of relatively acute onset without elevated left filling pressures. The cause is unclear, but she had a pre-existing pneumonia. The differential diagnosis for persistent hypoxia includes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)/chronic obstructive pneumonia (COP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential complication of ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammatory response, potentially due to the pneumonia or steroid treatment.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate high blood pressure, which could be a result of stress from the ICU stay or underlying cardiovascular issues.
4. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has high lipid levels, for which atorvastatin has been prescribed.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, being treated with levothyroxine.
6. Anxiety and Depression: The patient is being treated for anxiety and depression with klonopin and impramine respectively.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia (PNA) and now presents in the ICU with hypoxia. She has been receiving treatment for PNA with Vancomycin and Zosyn, and supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient is also receiving nebulizers as needed and a quick prednisone taper. The cause of her hypoxia is unclear, but she meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with bilateral infiltrates and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200. Differential diagnoses for persistent hypoxia include interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), eosinophilic pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's current condition of ARDS can lead to severe respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and potentially resulting in multiorgan dysfunction.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can further compromise lung function.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.
4. Stress ulcer: The use of corticosteroids and"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   1. Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.
   - Defer intubation for the time being, but started CPAP for comfort and
   to help with fatigue
   -Obtain ABG after one hour CPAP as marker for worsening
   hypercapnea/hypoxemia and possible support for intubation later
   - Supplemental oxygen to keep sat >90%
   - Continue treatment for PNA with vanc, but d/c Zosyn as has been on
   for 6 days with no improvement. D/c vanc tomorrow for same reason, but
   continue if worsens precipitously
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Quick prednisone taper (50 -> 40 -> 30 -> 20 -> 10 -> 0)
   - Will keep euvolemic for now
   - Review OSH chest CT with RADS and obtain high-res non-con CT chest
   today to assess for interval change
   - Sputum culture, if able
   - F/u ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **] here, and HIV from OSH
   - While on CPAP, use Ativan and morphine for agitation
   2. Leukocytosis. Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely
   contributors.
   3. Hypertension. Given possibility of intubation, will hold off on
   starting home meds now.
   4. Hyperlipidemia. Atorvastatin.
   5. Hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine.
   6. Anxiety. Klonopin.
   7. Depression. Imiprimine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with an admission for pneumonia (PNA) who is now presenting with hypoxia. The patient meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <200, bilateral infiltrates of relatively acute onset, and no apparent elevated left filling pressures. The cause of hypoxia is unclear, but the patient did present to the outside hospital with PNA. Differential diagnoses for persistent hypoxia include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia/COP (BOOP/COP), eosinophilic pneumonia, bacterial PNA (either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration PNA.

The plan includes deferring intubation for now but starting continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for comfort and to help with fatigue. An arterial blood gas (ABG) will be obtained after one hour of CPAP as a marker for worsening hypercapnea/hypoxemia and possible support for intubation later. Supplemental oxygen will be given to keep the patient's oxygen saturation (sat) >90%. Treatment for PNA will continue with vancomycin, but aztreonam will be discontinued as it has been on for 6 days with no improvement. Vancomycin will also be discontinued tomorrow for the same reason, but will be continued if the patient worsens precipitously."

   difficulty ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.
   - Plan to switch to propofol for improved sedation then paralyze to
   better ventilate and get esophageal balloon measurements to assist with
   guiding ventilator settings.
   - Continue treatment for PNA with vancomycin given acute worsening
   overnight.  Zosyn was stopped on [**4-2**] as no improvement after 6 days.
   Will start treatment with cefepime today ([**4-3**]).
   - Will attempt a minibal
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Will resume high dose steroids as unclear if infectious component;
   stop fast prednisone taper and place on solumedrol 125 Q8H
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now; Lasix today as pt. is 4L
   positive LOS and urine output is decreasing

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   1. Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.
   - Defer intubation for the time being, but started CPAP for comfort and
   to help with fatigue
   -Obtain ABG after one hour CPAP as marker for worsening
   hypercapnea/hypoxemia and possible support for intubation later
   - Supplemental oxygen to keep sat >90%
   - Continue treatment for PNA with vanc, but d/c Zosyn as has been on
   for 6 days with no improvement. D/c vanc tomorrow for same reason, but
   continue if worsens precipitously
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Quick prednisone taper (50 -> 40 -> 30 -> 20 -> 10 -> 0)
   - Will keep euvolemic for now
   - Review OSH chest CT with RADS and obtain high-res non-con CT chest
   today to assess for interval change
   - Sputum culture, if able
   - F/u ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **] here, and HIV from OSH
   - While on CPAP, use Ativan and morphine for agitation
   2. Leukocytosis. Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely
   contributors.
   3. Hypertension. Given possibility of intubation, will hold off on
   starting home meds now.
   4. Hyperlipidemia. Atorvastatin.
   5. Hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine.
   6. Anxiety. Klonopin.
   7. Depression. Imiprimine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxia. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for pneumonia (PNA) and presented with low oxygen levels (PaO2) requiring intubation. Arterial line and left internal jugular central venous line (CVL) were placed for blood pressure monitoring and access. A CT scan was deferred to improve ventilation and decrease peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) and plateau pressures. Steroid taper was written, and insulin sliding scale was initiated due to steroid use and dextrose in IV fluids. HIV test from the previous hospital (OSH) is still pending. Sedation is being switched to propofol for improved sedation with plans to paralyze for better ventilation. Allergies include a reaction to sulfa medications. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were piperacillin and vancomycin, administered on [**2191-4-2**] at 12:45 AM and 09:19 PM respectively. Infusions of fentanyl and midazolam are ongoing. Other ICU medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per"

   Assessment and Plan
   - Acute respiratory failure
 need to paralyse then use esophageal
   balloon to guide PEEPs and FiO2. Difficult to sedate with
   versed/fentanyl so switching to Propofol.  Would add cefepime to Vanc
   given her increasing infiltrates, persistent leukocytosis (on
   steroids). Unfortuntately she is too sick to obtain a lung biopsy or
   even transport for CT. Will empirically give high dose steroids. Will
   obtain a mini-BAL if possible.
   - Oliguria/FEN
 will try diuresing given 4 L positive balance, low
   pulmonary reserve. [**Month (only) 8**] need TPN, hold tube feeds.
   - Sedation
 would continue regular dosing of ativan to prevent benzo
   withdrawal.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   1. Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.  Patient intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing with
   difficulty ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.
   - Plan to switch to propofol for improved sedation then paralyze to
   better ventilate and get esophageal balloon measurements to assist with
   guiding ventilator settings.
   - Continue treatment for PNA with vancomycin given acute worsening
   overnight.  Zosyn was stopped on [**4-2**] as no improvement after 6 days.
   Will start treatment with cefepime today ([**4-3**]).
   - Will attempt a minibal
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Will resume high dose steroids as unclear if infectious component;
   stop fast prednisone taper and place on solumedrol 125 Q8H
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now; Lasix today as pt. is 4L
   positive LOS and urine output is decreasing
   - Will try to obtain high-res non-con CT chest today to assess for
   interval change if patient stable to go for scan.
   - Sputum culture, if able
   - F/u ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **] here, and HIV from OSH
   - Use Ativan and morphine for agitation
   2. Leukocytosis. Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely
   contributors.
   3. Hypertension. Will hold off on starting home meds given large
   amounts of sedating medications and normal BP currently.
   4. Hyperlipidemia. Atorvastatin.
   5. Hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine.
   6. Anxiety. d/c Klonopin.  Ativan prn
   7. Depression. Imiprimine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with an admission for pneumonia (PNA) at an outside hospital (OSH), now presenting on transfer with hypoxia. She meets criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200, bilateral infiltrates of relatively acute onset, and no apparent elevated left filling pressures. The cause is unclear, but she did present with a PNA. Differential diagnosis for persistent hypoxia includes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)/chronic obstructive pneumonia (COP), eosinophilic pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient was intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing and difficulty ventilating overnight. She reached ARDSnet settings, and plan is to switch to propofol for improved sedation, then paralyze to better ventilate and get esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding ventilator settings.

Treatment for PNA includes vancomycin given acute worsening overnight, and Zosyn was stopped on [**4-2**] as no improvement after 6 days. Cefepime will be started today. Nebulizer treatments (nebs) will be given PRN, and an attempt will be made to obtain a high-resolution non-contrast computed tomography (CT) chest today"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia, and anxiety. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. There have been some adjustments made to the ventilator settings, including increasing the respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (Vt). The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, and they have been receiving IV fluids and insulin to manage the hyperglycemia. The patient also has an allergy to sulfa medications. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, and they have shown signs of infection with a positive BAL and sputum culture. The patient's electrolytes and kidney function tests are within normal limits. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia. The patient has been given Ativan for anxiety, lasix for fluid management, and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, and their oxygen saturation remains above 95%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient. These include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and sputum cultures"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   1. Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.  Patient intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing with
   difficulty ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.
   Bronchoscopy performed [**4-3**].
   - Will start to wean sedation today.  Still start fentanyl/versed with
   slow wean of propofol.  Cont cisatracurium for now until propofol wean
   started, hope to wean paralytic throughout today
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.
   - Continue treatment for PNA with cefepime.  Vancomycin trough 46
   today, will d/c vanco for now and follow levels.  Zosyn was stopped on
   [**4-2**] as no improvement after 6 days.
   - Cont cefepime today (Day 1 [**4-3**]).
   - F/u BAL from [**4-3**]
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Solumedrol [**Last Name (LF) 5448**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] start 60mg q8 today
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - f/u final CT chest read, impression c/w ARDS
   - f/u BAL culture/studies
   - F/u ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **] here, and HIV from OSH
   - ABG today
   - QD NIF/VC
   2.  ARF:  Likely multifactoria with combination of contrast load from
   CT Chest performed on [**4-3**] as well as elements of hypovolemia with CVP
   3-5 in AM when labs drawn in combination of elements of sepsis.
   - U/A
   - urine studies, Ueos/smear, Ulytes
   - bladder pressures
   - cont IVF and fluid boluses for MAP >65 goal, UOP 30-50cc/hr goal
   3. Leukocytosis. Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely
   contributors, currently decreasing appropriately with antibiotics and
   steroid [**Month/Year (2) 5448**]
   4. Hypotension/Hypertension:  ill hold off on starting home
   antihypertensive meds given large amounts of sedating medications and
   normal BP currently.  Hypotension in MICU likely components of
   hypovolemia as well as sepsis.
   - cont IVF/boluses.
   - cont follow BP per a-line
   5. Hyperlipidemia. Atorvastatin.
   6. Hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine.
   7. Anxiety. d/c Klonopin.  Ativan prn
   8. Depression. Imiprimine
   FEN: NPO for now; bolus NS prn; hold on tube feeds today, consider
   tomorrow
   PPX: SC heparin; PPI; bowel regimen
   ACCESS: Midline from OSH (x-ray to check placement), PIV x1, A-line

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with admission for pneumonia who is now presenting with hypoxia. The patient has been intubated due to increased work of breathing and difficulty ventilating overnight. She meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200, bilateral infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left filling pressures, and unclear cause.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Persistent hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia has not improved despite interventions, and alternative diagnoses need to be considered such as interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)/chronic obstructive pneumonia (COP), eosinophilic pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia (possibly treated or resistant organism), or aspiration pneumonia.

2. ARDS-related complications: As the patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, she is at risk for complications associated with this condition, including worsening respiratory function, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential need for mechanical ventilation support.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's initial presentation was for pneumonia, and there is a need to continue treatment for PNA with cefepime. There is also a concern for antibiotic resistance since Zosyn was stopped without improvement after 6 days. The ongoing BAL culture/studies will help guide further management.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   1. Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.  Patient intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing with
   difficulty ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.
   - Will start to wean sedation today.  Still start fentanyl/versed with
   slow wean of propofol.  Cont cisatracurium for now until propofol wean
   started
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.
   - Continue treatment for PNA with cefepime.  Vancomycin trough 46
   today, will d/c vanco for now and follow levels.  Zosyn was stopped on
   [**4-2**] as no improvement after 6 days.
   - start treatment with cefepime today ([**4-3**]).
   - Will attempt a minibal
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Will resume high dose steroids as unclear if infectious component;
   stop fast prednisone taper and place on solumedrol 125 Q8H
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now; Lasix today as pt. is 4L
   positive LOS and urine output is decreasing
   - Will try to obtain high-res non-con CT chest today to assess for
   interval change if patient stable to go for scan.
   - Sputum culture, if able
   - F/u ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **] here, and HIV from OSH
   - Use Ativan and morphine for agitation
   2. Leukocytosis. Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely
   contributors.
   3. Hypertension. Will hold off on starting home meds given large
   amounts of sedating medications and normal BP currently.
   4. Hyperlipidemia. Atorvastatin.
   5. Hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine.
   6. Anxiety. d/c Klonopin.  Ativan prn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for pneumonia (PNA) and is now presenting with hypoxia. The patient meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200, bilateral infiltrates, and no apparent elevated left filling pressures. The cause of ARDS is unclear, but the patient had a previous pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels require close monitoring and management, including ongoing respiratory support and optimization of ventilator settings.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent this, such as elevating the head of the bed, using proper hand hygiene, and regularly assessing and clearing secretions.
3. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the underlying pneumonia and prolonged ICU stay, increasing the risk of acquiring additional nosocomial infections. Close monitoring of vital signs, regular cultures, and strict adherence to infection control practices are important.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has been receiving IV fluids and Lasix challenges, indicating a concern for fluid overload and the need for careful monitoring and management of fluid balance.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   1. Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.  Patient intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing with
   difficulty ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.
   Bronchoscopy performed [**4-3**].
   - Will start to wean sedation today.  Still start fentanyl/versed with
   slow wean of propofol.  Cont cisatracurium for now until propofol wean
   started, hope to wean paralytic throughout today
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.
   - Continue treatment for PNA with cefepime.  Vancomycin trough 46
   today, will d/c vanco for now and follow levels.  Zosyn was stopped on
   [**4-2**] as no improvement after 6 days.
   - Cont cefepime today (Day 1 [**4-3**]).
   - F/u BAL from [**4-3**]
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Solumedrol [**Last Name (LF) 5448**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] start 60mg q8 today
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - f/u final CT chest read, impression c/w ARDS
   - f/u BAL culture/studies
   - F/u ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **] here, and HIV from OSH
   - ABG today
   - QD NIF/VC
   2.  ARF:  Likely multifactoria with combination of contrast load from
   CT Chest performed on [**4-3**] as well as elements of hypovolemia with CVP
   3-5 in AM when labs drawn in combination of elements of sepsis.
   - U/A
   - urine studies, Ueos/smear, Ulytes
   - bladder pressures
   - cont IVF and fluid boluses for MAP >65 goal, UOP 30-50cc/hr goal
   3. Leukocytosis. Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely
   contributors, currently decreasing appropriately with antibiotics and
   steroid [**Month/Year (2) 5448**]
   4. Hypotension/Hypertension:  ill hold off on starting home
   antihypertensive meds given large amounts of sedating medications and
   normal BP currently.  Hypotension in MICU likely components of
   hypovolemia as well as sepsis.
   - cont IVF/boluses.
   - cont follow BP per a-line
   5. Hyperlipidemia. Atorvastatin.
   6. Hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine.
   7. Anxiety. d/c Klonopin.  Ativan prn
   8. Depression. Imiprimine
   FEN: NPO for now; bolus NS prn; hold on tube feeds today, consider
   tomorrow
   PPX: SC heparin; PPI; bowel regimen
   ACCESS: Midline from OSH (x-ray to check placement), PIV x1, A-line

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female who was admitted for pneumonia (PNA) and now presents with hypoxia. She meets the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) due to a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200, bilateral infiltrates, and relatively acute onset without elevated left filling pressures. The cause of hypoxia is unclear, but possible differential diagnoses include IPF, BOOP/COP, eosinophilic PNA, bacterial PNA, and aspiration PNA. The patient was intubated due to increased work of breathing and difficulty ventilating overnight. A bronchoscopy was performed, and the patient is being weaned off sedation. Treatment for PNA includes cefepime, and vancomycin is being discontinued. Esophageal balloon measurements are being used to guide ventilator settings. The patient's ARDSnet settings have been reached, and they are being closely monitored. Other ongoing treatments include nebs as needed, steroids for ARDS, euvolemia, and fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is a concern, and it may require further interventions such as adjusting ventilator settings or considering alternative treatments.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has leukocytosis and elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management is necessary"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   1. Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.  Patient intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing with
   difficulty ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.
   Bronchoscopy performed [**4-3**].
   - Will start to wean sedation today.  Still start fentanyl/versed with
   slow wean of propofol.  Cont cisatracurium for now until propofol wean
   started, hope to wean paralytic throughout today
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.
   - Continue treatment for PNA with cefepime.  Vancomycin trough 46
   today, will d/c vanco for now and follow levels.  Zosyn was stopped on
   [**4-2**] as no improvement after 6 days.
   - Cont cefepime today (Day 1 [**4-3**]).
   - F/u BAL from [**4-3**]
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Solumedrol [**Last Name (LF) 5448**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] start 60mg q8 today
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - f/u final CT chest read, impression c/w ARDS
   - f/u BAL culture/studies
   - F/u ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **] here, and HIV from OSH
   - ABG today
   - QD NIF/VC
   2.  ARF:  Likely multifactoria with combination of contrast load from
   CT Chest performed on [**4-3**] as well as elements of hypovolemia with CVP
   3-5 in AM when labs drawn in combination of elements of sepsis.
   - U/A
   - urine studies, Ueos/smear, Ulytes
   - bladder pressures
   - cont IVF and fluid boluses for MAP >65 goal, UOP 30-50cc/hr goal
   3. Leukocytosis. Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely
   contributors, currently decreasing appropriately with antibiotics and
   steroid [**Month/Year (2) 5448**]
   4. Hypotension/Hypertension:  ill hold off on starting home
   antihypertensive meds given large amounts of sedating medications and
   normal BP currently.  Hypotension in MICU likely components of
   hypovolemia as well as sepsis.
   - cont IVF/boluses.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's hypoxia is persistent, and there are bilateral infiltrates without elevated left filling pressures. The cause of the hypoxia is unclear, but potential differential diagnoses include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), eosinophilic pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently receiving cefepime for treatment of pneumonia, and vancomycin has been stopped with plans to follow levels. The patient's ARDSnet settings have been reached, and bronchoscopy has been performed. The patient's sedation is being weaned, and cisatracurium is being continued for now. Esophageal balloon measurements are being used to assist with guiding ventilator settings. The patient's ANCA, HIV, and final CT chest read are pending. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, which is likely multifactorial with pneumonia and steroids as contributors. Other conditions present include acute kidney injury (ARF), likely multifactorial with contrast load from CT chest, hypovolemia, and elements of sepsis. Hypotension and hypertension are also present, and the patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored. Hyperlipid"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxia. She has been admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and is now presenting with worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 120/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. She is intubated and sedated.

The patient's medical history includes anxiety, depression, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and hypotension/hypertension. She has allergies to sulfa medications and has received cefepime and vancomycin for her pneumonia. Her current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and propofol.

Physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally, decreased bowel sounds, superficial echymoses, trace edema bilaterally, and warm extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.25, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 35 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 191, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 16 mmol/L, base excess (BE) of -10 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%. Her respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is deferred due to PEEP > 10, FiO2 > 60%, and RR > 35.

The patient's urine culture is negative for bacteria, fungi, and acid-fast bacilli. Bronchoscopy performed on [**4-3**] shows no evidence of PCP, AFB, or fungus.

The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and her current condition meets the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 191. The cause of her hypoxia is unclear, but potential differential diagnoses include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)/chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome (COP), eosinophilic pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia (possibly treated or resistant organism), and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's plan includes continuing treatment for pneumonia with cefepime, monitoring vancomycin levels, and following up on BAL cultures/studies from [**4-3**], which are currently negative for PCP/AFB. Nebulized treatments will be given as needed, and a steroid taper will continue. The patient will be kept euvolemic, and a final CT chest read will be done to confirm the impression of ARDS. ANCA testing is negative, and HIV status will be obtained from the outside hospital"

   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.  Patient intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing with
   difficulty ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.
   Bronchoscopy performed [**4-3**], cultures from BAL significant for MRSA.
   - Tolerating fent/versed well, will start to wean sedation to allow pt
   to overbreath minimally.

   # ARF:  Likely multifactorial with combination of contrast load from CT
   Chest performed on [**4-3**] as well as elements of hypovolemia in
   combination of elements of sepsis.  Continued rise in creatinine,
   likely related to contrast bolus for CT scan.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, rec renal
   u/s, rpt Ulytes/eos, IVF, consider dialysis if acidosis doesn
   improve, follow Ca-Phos product for rise above 60, d/c topomax.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxia. She was admitted for pneumonia (PNA) to an outside hospital (OSH) and is now presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The cause of the hypoxia is unclear, but possible differentials include infectious pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and non-infectious causes. The patient was intubated due to increased work of breathing and difficulty ventilating overnight. Bronchoscopy performed showed MRSA in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture. She has been treated with various antibiotics, including cefepime and vancomycin. Her condition has improved with steroid therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is likely multifactorial, involving a combination of factors such as contrast load from a CT scan, hypovolemia, and elements of sepsis. Continued monitoring and management of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be essential.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury (AKI), likely related to contrast-induced nephropathy from the CT scan. Renal consultation has been requested for further evaluation and management.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's low bicarbonate levels indicate metabolic acidosis. This may be related to renal failure and the need for dialysis. Close monitoring of acid-base"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-inch tall individual with a current temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 118/55 to 122/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with coarse breath sounds bilaterally. They have decreased bowel sounds and superficial echymoses. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly high potassium levels, and altered kidney and liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia.
2. Renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine and urea levels, along with the presence of muddy brown casts in urine sediment.
3. Hyperglycemia, which may require close monitoring and management.
4. Potential infection due to the presence of anxiety and the need for prophylaxis against ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers.
5. Poor nutrition, as indicated by the alteration in nutrition status.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, pneumonia, anxiety, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and is receiving fluids and medications through central and peripheral lines. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/55 to 91/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's renal function is impaired with elevated serum creatinine levels. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, and there are signs of infection indicated by the presence of muddy brown casts in the urine sediment. The patient is receiving nutrition through tube feeds, and the goal is to maintain glycemic control. The patient's code status is full code, and the current disposition is ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS and respiratory failure may worsen due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation parameters.
2. Worsening renal function: The patient's acute renal failure may progress, leading to further deterioration of renal function and potential electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.  Patient intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing with
   difficulty ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.
   Bronchoscopy performed [**4-3**], cultures from BAL significant for MRSA.
   - Tolerating fent/versed well, continue current.
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU for pneumonia (PNA) and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been experiencing hypoxia and bilateral infiltrates of relatively acute onset without elevated left filling pressures. The cause of her condition is unclear, but potential differentials include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia/cellular pneumonia (BOOP/COP), eosinophilic pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient has been intubated since April 2nd due to increased work of breathing and difficulty ventilating, reaching ARDSnet settings. A bronchoscopy performed on April 3rd showed MRSA in the culture, ruling out Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and Aspergillus fumigatus infection. The patient has been receiving cefepime for treatment of PNA, and vancomycin has been continued with close monitoring of trough levels.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, and she is now experiencing acute kidney injury (ARF), likely multifactorial due to contrast load from a CT scan, hypovolemia, and elements of sepsis. Renal consult has been obtained, and renal ultrasound, repeat urine electrolytes, IV fluids, and consideration of dialysis if acidosis does not improve are recommended.

Other notable findings include leukocytosis, likely"

   # Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.  Patient intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing with
   difficulty ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.
   Bronchoscopy performed [**4-3**], cultures from BAL significant for MRSA.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and subsequent hypoxia. She meets criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with bilateral infiltrates and low PaO2/FiO2 ratio. The cause of her ARDS is unclear, but potential differentials include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient was intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing and difficulty ventilating, reaching ARDSnet settings. A bronchoscopy performed on [**4-3**] showed cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) significant for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). She was treated with cefepime and vancomycin, but MRSA was found in the BAL cultures. 

The patient's renal function has been compromised, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). This could be multifactorial, including ATN from hypotension, CIN from recent dye exposure, or postrenal causes. Renal consult is following for renal failure and acidosis. 

Other notable issues include leukocytosis, likely due to PNA and steroids, hypotension/hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, anxiety, depression, and nutritional support. The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.  Patient intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing with
   difficulty ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.
   Bronchoscopy performed [**4-3**], cultures from BAL significant for MRSA.
   - Tolerating fent/versed well, difficulty with weaning sedation and
   dyssynchrony with vent
   - inc fentanyl patch to 200mcg/hr
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.  Trans esophageal measurement +1.
   - Continue treatment for PNA with cefepime.  Vancomycin trough 32
   today, cont d/c vanco for now and follow levels.  Zosyn was stopped on
   [**4-2**] as no improvement after 6 days.  Cefepime was d/c [**4-6**] ([**Date range (1) 5497**])
   due to MRSA BAL cx.
   - Now that BAL cx MRSA +, cont d/c cefepime
   - BAL cultures/studies from bronchoscopy on [**4-3**]
 +MRSA in culture,
   PCP/AFB negative
   - Solumedrol taper to 40mg q12 today, then continue slow taper.
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - CT chest [**4-3**] impression c/w ARDS
   - ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive, titer 1:80
   - will not pursue HIV results from OSH as unclear interpretation.
   - cont to follow ABG to guide ventilator settings, nebs PRN
   # ARF:  Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN
   from possible hypotension (however no large drop in SBP is noted in
   metavision), CIN from recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased
   very quickly after the exposure), postrenal causes (less likely), or a
   combination of the above. Ueosin were negative, however this has low
   sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Muddy brown casts in the urine
   support ATN.  Continued rise in creatinine
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis
   - follow Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   - urine studies negative, Ueos/smear negative, Una<10
   - bladder pressures 12
   - cont IVF and fluid boluses for MAP >65 goal, UOP 30-50cc/hr goal.
   Currently relatively euvolemic
   # Leukocytosis. Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely
   contributors, currently decreasing appropriately with antibiotics and
   steroid taper
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:  Will hold off on starting home
   antihypertensive meds given large amounts of sedating medications and
   normal BP currently.  Hypotension in MICU likely components of
   hypovolemia as well as sepsis, currently BP stable without pressors.
   Fluid responsive

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia (PNA) and now presenting with hypoxia.
- She meets criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <200 and bilateral infiltrates.
- The cause of ARDS is unclear, but potential causes include IPF, BOOP/COP, eosinophilic PNA, bacterial PNA, or aspiration PNA.
- The patient was intubated due to increased work of breathing and difficulty ventilating.
- Bronchoscopy performed, cultures from BAL significant for MRSA.
- Current treatment includes fentanyl/versed sedation, continued treatment for PNA with cefepime, and vancomycin for MRSA.
- The patient is also on a steroid taper, esophageal balloon measurements, and transesophageal measurement to assist with guiding ventilator settings.
- Renal failure is likely multifactorial, with considerations including ATN, CIN, postrenal causes, or a combination of the above.
- Urine studies support ATN, and the patient is receiving renal consult and follow-up for renal failure and acidosis.
- Leukocytosis is multifactorial, with contributions from PNA and steroids.
- Hypotension/hypertension may be related to hypovolemia and sepsis, but currently stable without pressors.
- Hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, anxiety, and depression are also noted.
- The patient is on various medications including atorvastatin, levothyroxine, IV nutrition, and heparin.
- Lines include midline, arterial line, and multi-lumen.
- The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient meets criteria for ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory distress and potentially require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Complications of ARDS may include ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma, and acute lung injury.

2. Renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and muddy brown casts in urine suggest acute tubular necrosis (ATN). ATN can lead to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis if the condition does not improve.

3. MRSA infection: The patient's BAL cultures were positive for MRSA. If not appropriately treated, MRSA infection can lead to sepsis and septic shock.

4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which if left untreated, can result in various complications such as cardiovascular problems, neuromuscular dysfunction, and mental health issues.

5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's elevated lipid levels can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke.

6. Depression: Untreated depression can lead to poor overall health outcomes, decreased quality"

The patient is a 59-inch tall individual with a weight of 200 pounds, admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection. The patient's chief complaint is limited fluid bolus tolerance with 1L D5W 3 amp bicarb-water and the inability to lighten sedation due to becoming dyssynchronous. The patient has allergies to sulfa antibiotics and has been on multiple infusions including midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7 C (98 F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/64 to 151/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. 

Based on the flow sheet data, the patient's maximum fluid balance since 12 AM is 2,449 mL, with total intake being 2,449 mL and total output being 1,949 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 280 mL, respiratory rate set at 40 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0.

   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia. Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral
   infiltrates of relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left
   filling pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the
   OSH with a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less
   likely as not improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe
   acute, but no eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial
   PNA (but likely either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration
   PNA.  Patient intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing with
   difficulty ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.
   Bronchoscopy performed [**4-3**], cultures from BAL significant for MRSA.
   - Tolerating fent/versed well, will start to wean sedation to allow pt
   to overbreath minimally.
   - cont fentanyl patch
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.  Trans esophageal measurement +1.
   - Continue treatment for PNA with cefepime.  Vancomycin trough 32
   today, cont d/c vanco for now and follow levels.  Zosyn was stopped on
   [**4-2**] as no improvement after 6 days.  Cefepime was d/c [**4-6**] ([**Date range (1) 5497**])

   - BAL cultures/studies from bronchoscopy on [**4-3**]
 +MRSA in culture,
   PCP/AFB negative
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Cont Solumedrol at 40mg q8 dose since some improvement today.

   - CT chest [**4-3**] impression c/w ARDS
   - ANCA negative
   - [**Doctor First Name **] positive, titer 1:80
   - will not pursue HIV results from OSH as unclear interpretation.
   - cont to follow ABG to guide ventilator settings
   # ARF:  Likely multifactorial with combination of contrast load from CT
   Chest performed on [**4-3**] as well as elements of hypovolemia in
   combination of elements of sepsis.  Continued rise in creatinine,
   likely related to contrast bolus for CT scan.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, rec renal
   u/s, rpt Ulytes/eos, IVF, consider dialysis if acidosis doesn
   improve, follow Ca-Phos product for rise above 60, d/c topomax.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU with pneumonia (PNA) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, which led to the discontinuation of cefepime. Her condition has been complicated by hypoxia, leukocytosis, hypotension/hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, anxiety, depression, and renal failure. She is being treated with various medications including sedatives, antibiotics, steroids, antihypertensives, lipid-lowering agents, and thyroid supplements. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection: The patient's central venous lines increase the risk of bloodstream infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk for stress ulcers, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is declining, and further deterioration could require dialysis.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hyp"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxia. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for pneumonia (PNA) and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's medical history includes anxiety, depression, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and possible renal failure.

From the note, it can be determined that the patient has been experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is presenting with hypoxia, which is characterized by low oxygen levels in the blood. This has led to the diagnosis of ARDS, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient initially presented to the hospital with pneumonia, which may have contributed to the development of ARDS.

3. MRSA infection: Bronchoscopy results revealed the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the patient's lungs. This led to the discontinuation of cefepime, an antibiotic previously used for treating the PNA, as it is ineffective against MRSA.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI)/Renal failure: The patient is displaying signs of renal dysfunction, indicated by rising creatinine levels, muddy brown casts in the urine, and a negative eosinophil count. The cause of AKI is multifactorial,"

   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. Cuff leak this AM likely to complicate ability to reduce
   vent setting and PEEP today.
   - To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from fentanyl
   and midaz drips will initiate methadone and diazepam per NG tube. Will
   continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr.
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level);
   however, will get surveillance sputum culture today to see if MRSA
   persistent and then consider switch to linezolid.
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - Cont to follow ABG to guide ventilator settings, nebs PRN
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos were negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Continued rise in
   creatinine. Ca-phos product is ~44 today.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though rec no
   indication for dialysis at this time
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   # Leukocytosis:
   Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely contributors, currently
   decreasing appropriately with antibiotics and steroid taper.
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
    Will hold off on starting home antihypertensive meds given large
   amounts of sedating medications and normal BP currently.  Hypotension
   in MICU likely components of hypovolemia as well as sepsis, currently
   BP stable without vasoactive agents.  Fluid responsive

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of pneumonia that has developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) show Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The patient's condition is complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to other factors as well. She has a positive ANCA test but with a low titer of 1:80. Her HIV status is unknown. The patient is on a steroid taper and has required high levels of sedation due to ventilator dyssynchrony. A cuff leak was noted this morning, which may complicate the ability to reduce ventilator settings and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) today.

The assessment and plan include the following:
- To address sedation difficulty and attempt to wean the patient from fentanyl and midazolam drips, methadone and diazepam will be initiated through the nasogastric (NG) tube while continuing the fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr.
- Esophageal balloon measurements will be continued to assist with guiding ventilator settings.
- Vancomycin will be continued for MRSA, dosed on daily random vancomycin levels, and a surveillance sputum culture will be obtained today to determine if MRSA persists and"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for PNA to an OSH, now presenting on transfer with
   hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia:
   Meets criteria for ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <200), bilateral infiltrates of
   relatively acute onset without apparent elevated left filling
   pressures.  The cause is unclear though she did present to the OSH with
   a PNA. DDx for persisent hypoxia: IPF, BOOP/COP (but less likely as not
   improved with 10 days steroids), eosinophilic PNA (maybe acute, but no
   eos on differential argues against chronic), bacterial PNA (but likely
   either treated or resistant organism), and aspiration PNA.  Patient
   intubated on [**4-2**] due to increased work of breathing with difficulty
   ventilating her overnight and reaching ARDSnet settings.  Bronchoscopy
   performed [**4-3**], cultures from BAL significant for MRSA.
   - Tolerating fent/versed well, difficulty with weaning sedation and
   dyssynchrony with vent
   - inc fentanyl patch to 200mcg/hr
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.  Trans esophageal measurement +1.
   - Continue treatment for PNA with cefepime.  Vancomycin trough 32
   today, cont d/c vanco for now and follow levels.  Zosyn was stopped on
   [**4-2**] as no improvement after 6 days.  Cefepime was d/c [**4-6**] ([**Date range (1) 5497**])
   due to MRSA BAL cx.
   - Now that BAL cx MRSA +, cont d/c cefepime
   - BAL cultures/studies from bronchoscopy on [**4-3**]
 +MRSA in culture,
   PCP/AFB negative
   - Solumedrol taper to 40mg q12 today, then continue slow taper.
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - CT chest [**4-3**] impression c/w ARDS
   - ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive, titer 1:80
   - will not pursue HIV results from OSH as unclear interpretation.
   - cont to follow ABG to guide ventilator settings, nebs PRN
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN from
   possible hypotension (however no large drop in SBP is noted in
   metavision), CIN from recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased
   very quickly after the exposure), postrenal causes (less likely), or a
   combination of the above. Ueosin were negative, however this has low
   sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Muddy brown casts in the urine
   support ATN.  Continued rise in creatinine
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis
   - follow Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   - urine studies negative, Ueos/smear negative, Una<10
   - bladder pressures 12
   - cont IVF and fluid boluses for MAP >65 goal, UOP 30-50cc/hr goal.
   Currently relatively euvolemic
   # Leukocytosis:
   Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely contributors, currently
   decreasing appropriately with antibiotics and steroid taper.
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
    Will hold off on starting home antihypertensive meds given large
   amounts of sedating medications and normal BP currently.  Hypotension
   in MICU likely components of hypovolemia as well as sepsis, currently
   BP stable without pressors.  Fluid responsive
   - cont IVF/boluses.
   - cont follow BP per a-line

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU for pneumonia (PNA) and now presenting with hypoxia. The patient meets criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 200, bilateral infiltrates, and relatively acute onset without elevated left filling pressures. The cause is unclear, but potential differential diagnoses include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia/cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP/COP), eosinophilic pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient was intubated due to increased work of breathing and difficulty ventilating, reaching ARDSnet settings. A bronchoscopy was performed, cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) significant for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing severe hypoxia due to ARDS. The cause of ARDS is unclear, but potential causes include bacterial pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and eosinophilic pneumonia.
2. MRSA infection: The patient's BAL culture is positive for MRSA, indicating a bacterial infection caused by this resistant organism.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)/Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has a rising creatinine level and muddy brown casts in the urine, which suggest ATN"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and bacterial pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 280 mL, respiratory rate set at 40 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently elevated, ranging from 138 to 272 mg/dL. The patient's renal function has been deteriorating, with increasing creatinine levels from 3.5 to 4.9 mg/dL. There are no recent updates on the patient's neurologic status or peripheral vascular examination. The patient's anxiety is noted but no specific interventions have been mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for new or worsening respiratory symptoms, such as fever, increased sputum production, or changes in oxygenation, is essential.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. Regular assessment for signs of DVT, such as swelling, pain, or redness in the lower extremities, should be performed.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of nosocomial"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. Cuff leak this AM likely to complicate ability to reduce
   vent setting and PEEP today.
   - To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from fentanyl
   and midaz drips will initiate methadone and diazepam per NG tube. Will
   continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr.
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level);
   however, will get surveillance sputum culture today to see if MRSA
   persistent and then consider switch to linezolid.
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - Cont to follow ABG to guide ventilator settings, nebs PRN
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos were negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Continued rise in
   creatinine. Ca-phos product is ~44 today.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though rec no
   indication for dialysis at this time
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   # Leukocytosis:
   Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely contributors, currently
   decreasing appropriately with antibiotics and steroid taper.
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
    Will hold off on starting home antihypertensive meds given large
   amounts of sedating medications and normal BP currently.  Hypotension
   in MICU likely components of hypovolemia as well as sepsis, currently
   BP stable without vasoactive agents.  Fluid responsive

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with an admission for pneumonia that has developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures show Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Sedation requirements have increased, and there have been issues with ventilator dyssynchrony. The patient also has a cuff leak around the high endotracheal tube, which may complicate the ability to reduce vent settings and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) today.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Other complicating factors are being considered, but ANCA-negative, and the patient has a positive p-ANCA titer of only 1:80. HIV status is unknown, and the patient has been on a steroid taper.
2. Renal failure and acidosis: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, and there is a continued rise in creatinine. The differential diagnosis for acute renal failure includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN), contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), postrenal causes, and a combination of the above. Urine eosinophils were negative, but this test has low sensitivity and specificity for allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN)."

The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, anxiety, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

The patient had a cuff leak around the high endotracheal tube in the morning, which was repositioned over bronchoscope. Sedation requirement increased, and the patient received 150 mEq HCO3 in D5W for low urine output. The ventilator settings were adjusted, and PEEP was increased to 12 after a brief episode of hypoxia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/53 mmHg to 142/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and central venous pressure is within normal limits. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,576 mL, output of 1,420 mL, and a positive balance of 1,156 mL since 12 AM.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal sodium, slightly elevated potassium, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. Glucose levels are also elevated. Other lab values, including liver enzymes, electroly"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. Cuff leak yesterday AM was prohibitive of liberation for
   current vent settings. Had desat overnight that prompted brief increase
   in PEEP prior to being returned to PEEP of 10 early this AM. To address
   sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from fentanyl and midaz
   drips we initiated methadone and diazepam per NG tube yesterday.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level);
   however, will follow-up surveillance sputum culture to see if MRSA
   persistent and then consider switch to linezolid.
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr.
   - Continue attempt to liberate from drip sedation by using oral meds
   and fent patch
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.
   - Cont to follow ABG to guide ventilator settings, nebs PRN
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Creatinine stable at
   3.8 today. Ca-phos product remains ~44 today. Has had low UOP in last
   24 hours and received fluid boluses for this.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though report
   no indication for dialysis at this time
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 today. Has been slowly trending down since admission.
   Likely related to phlebotomy.
   - Continue to trend
   - Draw iron studies, B12 and folate
   # Leukocytosis:
   Now with WBC count of 9.6. Leukocytosis was likely multifactorial with
   PNA and steroids as contributors, WBC count currently decreasing
   appropriately with antibiotics and steroid taper.
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
    Will hold off on starting home antihypertensive meds given large
   amounts of sedating medications and normal BP currently.  Hypotension
   in MICU likely components of hypovolemia as well as sepsis, currently
   BP stable without vasoactive agents.  Fluid responsive

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient experienced a cuff leak around the high endotracheal tube in the morning, which was repositioned over a bronchoscope.
- Sedation requirement increased around this event.
- Patient received 150 mEq HCO3 in D5W for low urine output.
- Vent setting tidal volume increased to 260 in the morning with evening ABG showing pH 7.34, PaCO2 52, and PaO2 85.
- Patient had a brief episode of hypoxia in the middle of the night, and an ABG was drawn showing pH 7.31, PaCO2 55, and PaO2 65. PEEP was briefly increased to 12 before being reduced back to 10 due to high peak airway pressures.
- The patient received infusions of fentanyl and midazolam.
- Pantoprazole (Protonix) was administered at 08:21 PM on 04-08-2191.
- Heparin sodium (prophylaxis) was given at 12:05 AM on 04-09-2191.
- Methadone hydrochloride was administered at 04:00 AM on 04-09-2191.
- Other medications and treatments were also administered, including vecuronium, methadone, diazepam, vancomycin, and solumedrol.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia developing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The sputum and Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) cultures show MRSA infection. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring increased sedation and ventilator settings. She has also developed acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia, and leukocytosis. The patient's blood pressure is currently stable without the need for vasoactive agents.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and surveillance cultures are important to prevent and detect this complication.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, as indicated by an increase in serum creatinine levels. It is essential to closely monitor renal parameters and consider appropriate interventions such as fluid management and consultation with a nephrologist.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) level is low, indicating anemia. Further investigation into the cause of anemia is warranted, including iron studies, B12, and folate levels. Nutritional support may also be necessary to address this issue.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. Cuff leak this AM likely to complicate ability to reduce
   vent setting and PEEP today.
   - To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from fentanyl
   and midaz drips will initiate methadone and diazepam per NG tube. Will
   continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr.
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level);
   however, will get surveillance sputum culture today to see if MRSA
   persistent and then consider switch to linezolid.
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - Cont to follow ABG to guide ventilator settings, nebs PRN
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos were negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Continued rise in
   creatinine. Ca-phos product is ~44 today.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though rec no
   indication for dialysis at this time
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   # Leukocytosis:
   Multifactorial with PNA and steroids likely contributors, currently
   decreasing appropriately with antibiotics and steroid taper.
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
    Will hold off on starting home antihypertensive meds given large
   amounts of sedating medications and normal BP currently.  Hypotension
   in MICU likely components of hypovolemia as well as sepsis, currently
   BP stable without vasoactive agents.  Fluid responsive

","The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, which has progressed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures showed Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and she is currently being treated with vancomycin. 

The patient's sedation requirement has increased, and she is currently receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions. The ventilator settings were adjusted due to a cuff leak around the high endotracheal tube, and there was a brief episode of hypoxia in the middle of the night. The patient's ABG values indicate respiratory acidosis.

The patient's renal function is impaired, as shown by the rising serum creatinine levels and a decrease in urine output. A renal ultrasound did not reveal any hydronephrosis, suggesting that postrenal causes are unlikely. The patient's leukocytosis is decreasing appropriately with antibiotics and steroid taper. 

The patient's blood pressure is currently stable without the need for vasoactive agents, and fluid responsiveness is observed. Her nutrition is being provided through a Renal (Full) formula via a feeding tube.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of a cuff leak around the high endotracheal tube in the morning. The patient's sedation requirement was increased, and he received 150 mEq HCO3 in D5W for low urine output. The ventilator setting tidal volume was increased to 260 in the morning, and the ABG showed a pH of 7.34/52/85. The patient experienced hypoxia briefly in the middle of the night, with an ABG drawn at 7.31/55/65. PEEP was slightly increased to 12. The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and hives as a last dose of antibiotics. The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam, as well as other ICU medications. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 C (98.2 F), heart rate of 83 bpm (82-97 bpm), blood pressure of 142/67 mmHg (94/53-142/67 mmHg), respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute (31-49 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,576 mL and total output of 1,420 mL. The patient's urine output is 1,020 mL. The respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator mode, tidal volume set at 260 mL, respiratory rate set at 40 breaths per minute, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%, and RSBI deferred due to PEEP > 10, FiO2 > 60%, and RR > 35. 

The patient's physical examination is not fully assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal liver function test results. 

Assessment and plan include alterations in nutrition, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hyperglycemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and anxiety. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening renal function, progression of ARDS, uncontrolled hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, complications related to mechanical ventilation, and potential infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam per NG
   tube, however she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips
   though at reduced doses.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level), will
   need vanc dosed today
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr.
   - Continue attempt to liberate from drip sedation by using oral meds
   and fent patch
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.
   - Cont to follow ABG to guide ventilator settings, nebs PRN
   - consider lower PEEP as this would aid in trach procedure
   - d/w IP re:possible trach in near future
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT is 74.1 today on heparin SC and so a drip
   was not started. Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin SC,
   however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so unlikely
   to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor.
   - cont to follow coags, plan to anticoagulate as needed for DVT,
   currently has therapeutic PTT
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Creatinine stable at
   3.8 today. Ca-phos product remains ~40 today. Has had good UOP in last
   24 hours.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though report
   no indication for dialysis at this time
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 yesterday, received 2 units pRBC
s with good response and
   is now stable. Likely related to phlebotomy. Per report, patient has
   history of pernicious anemia.
   - Continue to trend
   # Leukocytosis:
   Now with WBC count of 9.7. Leukocytosis was likely multifactorial with
   PNA and steroids as contributors, WBC count currently decreasing
   appropriately with antibiotics and steroid taper.
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
    Will hold off on starting home antihypertensive meds given large
   amounts of sedating medications and normal BP currently.  Hypotension
   in MICU likely components of hypovolemia as well as sepsis, currently
   BP stable without vasoactive agents.  Fluid responsive
   - Continue to monitor
   # access: plan to remove midline today (was placed at OSH) and have
   PICC placed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia, which has progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has a history of MRSA infection, and her sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) show MRSA. The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS is causing severe hypoxemia, requiring ongoing ventilatory support.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a left internal jugular vein (IJ) clot extending into the subclavian vein. This line was removed, but her activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is elevated on heparin subcutaneous (SC), indicating a potential thrombosis.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL. The differential diagnosis includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN), contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), postrenal causes, and possibly a combination of these factors. Renal consult is following for further evaluation and management.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, likely related to phlebotomy and a history of pernicious anemia. Blood transfusion was given, resulting in a good response.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, anxiety, and community-acquired pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and sedated, with mechanical ventilation support. There are concerns about the patient's nutritional status and glycemic control. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamide antibiotics and is receiving various medications, including Fentanyl, Hydralazine, Heparin Sodium, and Methadone Hydrochloride. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they exhibit signs of respiratory distress with decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's renal function is impaired, and there are signs of fluid overload. The patient has a history of anxiety and is currently receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, hyperglycemia, anxiety, and pneumonia. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136-170 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, low hemoglobin, and high glucose levels. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. ARDS Progression: The patient has a diagnosis of ARDS, which is a serious lung condition characterized by inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. If the underlying cause of ARDS is not appropriately managed, the patient's lung function may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.

2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels. This indicates a risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI), which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances,"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. Cuff leak yesterday AM was prohibitive of liberation for
   current vent settings. Had desat overnight that prompted brief increase
   in PEEP prior to being returned to PEEP of 10 early this AM. To address
   sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from fentanyl and midaz
   drips we initiated methadone and diazepam per NG tube yesterday.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level);
   however, will follow-up surveillance sputum culture to see if MRSA
   persistent and then consider switch to linezolid.
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr.
   - Continue attempt to liberate from drip sedation by using oral meds
   and fent patch
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.
   - Cont to follow ABG to guide ventilator settings, nebs PRN
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Creatinine stable at
   3.8 today. Ca-phos product remains ~44 today. Has had low UOP in last
   24 hours and received fluid boluses for this.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though report
   no indication for dialysis at this time
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 today. Has been slowly trending down since admission.
   Likely related to phlebotomy.
   - Continue to trend
   - Draw iron studies, B12 and folate
   # Leukocytosis:
   Now with WBC count of 9.6. Leukocytosis was likely multifactorial with
   PNA and steroids as contributors, WBC count currently decreasing
   appropriately with antibiotics and steroid taper.
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
    Will hold off on starting home antihypertensive meds given large
   amounts of sedating medications and normal BP currently.  Hypotension
   in MICU likely components of hypovolemia as well as sepsis, currently
   BP stable without vasoactive agents.  Fluid responsive

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was admitted for pneumonia and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including the formation of blood clots in the internal jugular and subclavian veins associated with central venous catheters, which required removal of the lines and initiation of heparin therapy.

The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, likely due to phlebotomy. She has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.6 K/uL, which is decreasing appropriately with antibiotics and steroid taper. Additionally, she is experiencing hypotension and hypertension, which is being managed by monitoring fluid responsiveness and adjusting treatment accordingly.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL. She has acute kidney injury (AKI), possibly due to a combination of factors such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN), contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), or postrenal causes. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause of her renal failure.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including vancomycin for MRSA pneumonia, solumedrol taper, fentanyl patch, methadone, and diazepam for sedation management. She is also receiving renal nutrition and close monitoring of"

   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT is 74.1 today on heparin SC and so a drip
   was not started. Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin SC,
   however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so unlikely
   to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor.

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia that has progressed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures have shown Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and she is currently being treated with Vancomycin.

The patient is still requiring sedation and ventilatory support due to difficulty with synchrony when sedation is lightened. An attempt to wean sedation has been made using methadone and diazepam via nasogastric (NG) tube, but the patient is still needing fentanyl and midazolam drips at reduced doses.

The patient also has a left iliac-jugular vein thrombosis extending into the subclavian vein. The central line was removed, but the patient's partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is elevated on heparin subcutaneous, so a drip was not started. The rise in PTT could be due to heparin SC or a deficiency in a clotting factor, but the patient had a normal PTT on this admission before.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam per NG
   tube, however she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips
   though at reduced doses.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level), will
   need vanc dosed today
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr.
   - Continue attempt to liberate from drip sedation by using oral meds
   and fent patch
   - Cont esophageal balloon measurements to assist with guiding
   ventilator settings.
   - Cont to follow ABG to guide ventilator settings, nebs PRN
   - consider lower PEEP as this would aid in trach procedure
   - d/w IP re:possible trach in near future
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT is 74.1 today on heparin SC and so a drip
   was not started. Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin SC,
   however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so unlikely
   to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor.
   - cont to follow coags, plan to anticoagulate as needed for DVT,
   currently has therapeutic PTT
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Creatinine stable at
   3.8 today. Ca-phos product remains ~40 today. Has had good UOP in last
   24 hours.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though report
   no indication for dialysis at this time
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 yesterday, received 2 units pRBC
s with good response and
   is now stable. Likely related to phlebotomy. Per report, patient has
   history of pernicious anemia.
   - Continue to trend
   # Leukocytosis:
   Now with WBC count of 9.7. Leukocytosis was likely multifactorial with
   PNA and steroids as contributors, WBC count currently decreasing
   appropriately with antibiotics and steroid taper.
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
    Will hold off on starting home antihypertensive meds given large
   amounts of sedating medications and normal BP currently.  Hypotension
   in MICU likely components of hypovolemia as well as sepsis, currently
   BP stable without vasoactive agents.  Fluid responsive
   - Continue to monitor
   # access: plan to remove midline today (was placed at OSH) and have
   PICC placed.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female with admission for pneumonia developing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Sputum and Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) showing Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.
- The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS and requires mechanical ventilation.
- She is also experiencing sedation difficulty, possibly due to ventilator dyssynchrony.
- The patient has a history of pernicious anemia and is anemic with a Hematocrit (HCT) level of 22.2, which was treated with packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
- She has leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.7, likely multifactorial with pneumonia and steroid use.
- The patient has renal failure with an elevated creatinine level of 3.8, possibly due to Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) or Contrast-induced Nephropathy (CIN).
- She also has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left internal jugular vein extending into the subclavian vein.
- The patient's platelet count is low, possibly due to sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The ongoing presence of MRSA infection and the patient's immunocompromised state due to steroids and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate, potentially requiring dialysis.
4. DVT and pulmonary embolism: The patient has an existing DVT, which can potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism if it dislodges and travels to the lungs.
5. Bleeding: The low platelet count and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) increase the risk of bleeding complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, infection control measures, renal function, coagulation profile, and cardiovascular stability to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hyperlipidemia. On admission, the patient was intubated due to severe respiratory distress and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history is significant for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hyperglycemia, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's family history is significant for coronary artery disease.

On the current day, the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 148/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on FiO2 60%. The patient is still on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 260 mL and respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The plateau pressure is 38 cmH2O and compliance is 9.8 cmH2O/mL. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 51 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 153.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,610 mL (including 370 mL of IV fluids) and an output of 1,220 mL (including 240 mL of urine). The patient's blood product transfusion was 770 mL with an output of 142 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cell count (WBC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate. The patient's glucose level is elevated at 153 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range except for a slightly low potassium level (K+). The platelet count is within normal range.

The patient's medications include midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, hydralazine, heparin sodium, and methadone hydrochloride. The patient's allergies include a reaction to sulfa medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, which is a potential complication of immobility and can lead to pulmonary embolism if not managed appropriately.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated levels of BUN and creatinine suggest renal dysfunction. ARF can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and low PaO2/FiO2 ratio indicate the presence of ARDS. ARDS can progress to respiratory failure and may require invasive mechanical ventilation.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose level indicates hyperglycemia, which can complicate wound healing, increase the risk of infection, and contribute to poor outcomes.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's history of CAP and current respiratory symptoms raise concerns for pneumonia progression or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] with rare MRSA
   growth; however, as overall status improving and WBC count meta-stable,
   will continue with vancomycin at this time.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level)
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now, and anticipate diuresis again
   when kidneys show greater recovery
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - Distant plan is for trach in the future following further vent
   liberation and diuresis
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT is 74.1 today on heparin SC and so a drip
   was not started. Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin SC,
   however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so unlikely
   to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor unless
   poor nutritional status is now contributing. Regardless as it is
   currently unknown if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable
   state, will check for lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid
   antibodies.
   - Cont to follow [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] discontinue heparin subcutaneous if PTT
   continues to rise.
   - Plan to anticoagulate as needed for DVT pending antibody studies
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Creatinine decreasing
   to 3.4 today. Ca-phos product at ~35 today. Has had increasing UOP in
   the last 24 hours.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though report
   no indication for dialysis at this time
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   and is now stable with HCT of 28 this AM. Per report, patient has
   history of pernicious anemia.
   - Continue to trend
   - Check B12 levels
   # Leukocytosis:
   Leukocytosis likely multifactorial with PNA and steroids as
   contributors, WBC count of 11.8 today is slightly up from 9.7
   yesterday; however, no fever spikes consistent with new infection.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Access:
   Currently has only A-line and two peripheral IVs. Plan for PICC later
   today.

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was admitted for pneumonia that developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures showed MRSA growth. The patient has been on vancomycin therapy.

The patient has been requiring high levels of sedation due to ventilator dyssynchrony when sedation is lightened. To address this issue and attempt to wean off fentanyl and midazolam infusions, methadone and diazepam IV were initiated. However, the patient is still requiring reduced doses of fentanyl and versed drips.

The patient also has a history of pernicious anemia and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with good response and stable hematocrit (HCT) level of 28%.

Other findings include leukocytosis, which is likely multifactorial with pneumonia and steroid use as contributors. The patient's PTT is elevated, possibly due to heparin subcutaneous administration, but it is unclear if this rise in PTT represents anticoagulation or a hypercoagulable state. Further investigation is needed.

The patient's renal function has improved, with a decrease in creatinine to 3.4. However, she is still experiencing acute kidney injury (AKI) with muddy brown casts on sediment examination, possibly indicating"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] with rare MRSA
   growth.  Worsening peaks pressures this AM
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level)
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now, and anticipate diuresis again
   when kidneys show greater recovery
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - Distant plan is for trach in the future following further vent
   liberation and diuresis
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT is 74.1 today on heparin SC and so a drip
   was not started. Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin SC,
   however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so unlikely
   to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor unless
   poor nutritional status is now contributing. Regardless as it is
   currently unknown if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable
   state, will check for lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid
   antibodies.
   - Cont to follow [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] discontinue heparin subcutaneous if PTT
   continues to rise.
   - Plan to anticoagulate as needed for DVT pending antibody studies
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Creatinine decreasing
   to 3.4 today.  Has had increasing UOP in the last 24 hours.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though report
   no indication for dialysis at this time
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   and is now stable with HCT of 28 this AM. Per report, patient has
   history of pernicious anemia.
   - Continue to trend
   - Check B12 levels
   # Leukocytosis:
   Leukocytosis likely multifactorial with PNA and steroids as
   contributors, WBC count of 11.8 today is slightly up from 9.7
   yesterday; however, no fever spikes consistent with new infection.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Access:
   Currently has only A-line and two peripheral IVs. Plan for PICC later
   today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia that developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and is currently on vancomycin.
- The patient requires high levels of sedation due to ventilator dyssynchrony.
- A surveillance sputum culture showed rare MRSA growth.
- The patient has worsening peak airway pressures.
- The patient has been found to have a left internal jugular (IJ) clot extending into the subclavian vein. The line was removed, and no heparin drip was started due to a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT).
- The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). The cause is multifactorial, with possibilities including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), or postrenal causes.
- The patient has anemia with a hematocrit (HCT) of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**]. Iron studies showed a ferritin level of 346 and an iron saturation (ISAT) of 25%, which are not consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The patient received 2 units packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with a good response.
- The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 11.8"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] with rare MRSA
   growth.  Worsening peaks pressures this AM
   - Due to high peak pressures this AM, will attempt added bolus sedation
   if PIP>50 for prolonged periods.  Consider paralytic if unable to
   control PIP.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level)
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now, and anticipate diuresis again
   when kidneys show greater recovery
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - Distant plan is for trach in the future following further vent
   liberation and diuresis
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT is 74.1 today on heparin SC and so a drip
   was not started. Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin SC,
   however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so unlikely
   to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor unless
   poor nutritional status is now contributing. Regardless as it is
   currently unknown if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable
   state.
   - f/u lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid antibodies studies
   - Cont to follow coags
   - Cont sq heparin for now,  d/c if PTT supratherapeutic.
   - Plan to anticoagulate as needed for DVT pending antibody studies
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Creatinine decreasing
   to 3.4->3 today.  Has had increasing UOP in the last 24 hours.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though report
   no indication for dialysis at this time
   - Improved Cr today, will plan to initiate diuresis once Cr<3.
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   and is now stable with HCT of 28 this AM. Per report, patient has
   history of pernicious anemia.
   - Continue to trend
   - Check B12 levels
   # Leukocytosis:
   Leukocytosis likely multifactorial with PNA and steroids as
   contributors, WBC count of 11.8 today is slightly up from 9.7
   yesterday; however, no fever spikes consistent with new infection.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Access:
   Currently has only A-line and two peripheral IVs. Since pt with
   unstable PIP, will leave PICC line in midline position instead of trip
   to IR today.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with an admission for pneumonia that developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She has been diagnosed with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. She also has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left internal jugular vein extending into the subclavian vein. The patient's PTT is elevated, but no anticoagulation therapy has been started yet. She is also showing signs of acute kidney injury (AKI), likely multifactorial, with possible causes including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), and postrenal causes. The patient has received packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to anemia, which improved her hemoglobin level. Her leukocyte count is slightly elevated, and she has been on prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with recent hypertension. She has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, peripheral IV lines, and a midline PICC line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis ("

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] with rare MRSA
   growth.  Worsening peaks pressures this AM
   - Due to high peak pressures this AM, will attempt added bolus sedation
   if PIP>50 for prolonged periods.  Consider paralytic if unable to
   control PIP.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level)
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now, and anticipate diuresis again
   when kidneys show greater recovery
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - Distant plan is for trach in the future following further vent
   liberation and diuresis
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT is 74.1 today on heparin SC and so a drip
   was not started. Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin SC,
   however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so unlikely
   to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor unless
   poor nutritional status is now contributing. Regardless as it is
   currently unknown if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable
   state.
   - f/u lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid antibodies studies
   - Cont to follow coags
   - Cont sq heparin for now,  d/c if PTT supratherapeutic.
   - Plan to anticoagulate as needed for DVT pending antibody studies
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Creatinine decreasing
   to 3.4->3 today.  Has had increasing UOP in the last 24 hours.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though report
   no indication for dialysis at this time
   - Improved Cr today, will plan to initiate diuresis once Cr<3.
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   and is now stable with HCT of 28 this AM. Per report, patient has
   history of pernicious anemia.
   - Continue to trend
   - Check B12 levels
   # Leukocytosis:
   Leukocytosis likely multifactorial with PNA and steroids as
   contributors, WBC count of 11.8 today is slightly up from 9.7
   yesterday; however, no fever spikes consistent with new infection.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Access:
   Currently has only A-line and two peripheral IVs. Since pt with
   unstable PIP, will leave PICC line in midline position instead of trip
   to IR today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia developing into ARDS. She has been intubated and sedated due to ventilator dyssynchrony. The patient's sputum and BAL show MRSA, and she has been on Vancomycin therapy. She also has a history of DVT and has been found to have a clot in the left Iliac-Jugular vein extending into the subclavian vein. The line was removed, and she is currently on heparin subcutaneously.

The patient's renal function has been declining, with an increasing creatinine level and oliguria. She has been diagnosed with ARF, and the cause is likely multifactorial including ATN, CIN, and postrenal causes. Urine eosinophils were negative, indicating a low likelihood of AIN. Her creatinine level has improved, and she will be started on diuretics once her creatinine level falls below 3.

The patient also has anemia with a HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**], which is thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells with a good response and is now stable with a HCT of 28. She has a history of pernicious anemia, and her B12 levels should be checked.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] with rare MRSA
   growth.  Worsening peaks pressures this AM
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA, as Vanco level was 17.2 this AM, likely
   one additional dose of vancomycin today will complete her antibiotic
   course
   - Yesterday was last day of solumedrol
   - Will check PM lytes and begin diuresis with 10 mg IV furosemide if
   creatinine stable or continuing to improve
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - Contact IP today to let them know that trach and PEG are within
   immediate future for this patient
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. PTT today
   was 65.9.
   - F/U lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid antibodies studies
   - Cont to follow coags
   - Cont sq heparin for now, d/c if PTT supratherapeutic, start heparin
   drip at low rate today if PTT drops below 50 on evening PTT check
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her [**Last Name (un) **] includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitivity and specificity for AIN. Creatinine decreasing
   to 2.7 today.  Has had increasing UOP in the last 24 hours and
   auto-diuresed to negative fluid balance yesterday. Will  check PM lytes
   and I/O balance.
   - Renal consult following
   - Improved Cr today, will plan to initiate diuresis if creatinine on PM
   lytes check is stable or improved from this AM
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.4 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS. She has been admitted for pneumonia and has been on a steroid taper. The patient requires high sedation due to ventilator dyssynchrony. She is still on fentanyl and midazolam drips, although at reduced doses. The patient's sputum and BAL show MRSA, and she has been receiving vancomycin treatment. Her PIP has worsened, and she is being closely monitored. The patient also has a history of DVT with a clot extending into the subclavian vein. Her PTT is elevated, and she is on subcutaneous heparin. Additionally, the patient has renal impairment with an increasing creatinine level, possibly due to ATN, CIN, or postrenal causes. She is being closely monitored, and a renal consult has been requested. The patient's anemia is thought to be secondary to phlebotomy, but her iron studies do not support iron deficiency anemia. She has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with good response. The patient's blood pressure has recently become hypertensive, and she is being allowed some permissive hypertension. Her nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, renal failure, DVT, hyperglycemia, and anxiety. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has an arterial line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). If left untreated or inadequately treated, pneumonia can lead to worsening lung function, sepsis, and potentially death.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is already diagnosed with ARDS, which is a severe lung condition causing respiratory failure. Complications can include further deterioration of lung function, need for increased ventilatory support, and potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine and BUN levels. This condition can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy such as dialysis.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to pulmonary embolism, which is a life-threatening complication.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia. Poorly controlled"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] with rare MRSA
   growth.  Worsening peaks pressures this AM
   - Due to high peak pressures this AM, will attempt added bolus sedation
   if PIP>50 for prolonged periods.  Consider paralytic if unable to
   control PIP.
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA (dosed on daily random vanc level)
   - Continue solumedrol taper
   - Will attempt to keep euvolemic for now, and anticipate diuresis again
   when kidneys show greater recovery
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - Distant plan is for trach in the future following further vent
   liberation and diuresis
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT is 74.1 today on heparin SC and so a drip
   was not started. Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin SC,
   however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so unlikely
   to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor unless
   poor nutritional status is now contributing. Regardless as it is
   currently unknown if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable
   state.
   - f/u lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid antibodies studies
   - Cont to follow coags
   - Cont sq heparin for now,  d/c if PTT supratherapeutic.
   - Plan to anticoagulate as needed for DVT pending antibody studies
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her ARF includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitiviy and specificity for AIN. Creatinine decreasing
   to 3.4->3 today.  Has had increasing UOP in the last 24 hours.
   - Renal consult following for renal failure and acidosis, though report
   no indication for dialysis at this time
   - Improved Cr today, will plan to initiate diuresis once Cr<3.
   - Continue following Ca-Phos product for rise above 60
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   and is now stable with HCT of 28 this AM. Per report, patient has
   history of pernicious anemia.
   - Continue to trend
   - Check B12 levels
   # Leukocytosis:
   Leukocytosis likely multifactorial with PNA and steroids as
   contributors, WBC count of 11.8 today is slightly up from 9.7
   yesterday; however, no fever spikes consistent with new infection.
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Access:
   Currently has only A-line and two peripheral IVs. Since pt with
   unstable PIP, will leave PICC line in midline position instead of trip
   to IR today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU for pneumonia that has progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She has been diagnosed with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient's condition is complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure, a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia, leukocytosis, and hypertension/hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS is worsening, leading to increased peak inspiratory pressures (PIP). This may result in further lung damage and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. DVT: The patient has a confirmed left iliac vein clot extending into the subclavian vein. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to pulmonary embolism.
3. AKI: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. Failure to improve renal function may require dialysis and impact fluid balance management.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels are low, indicating anemia. Further evaluation of the cause is necessary, including checking B12 levels and considering blood transfusion if needed.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which can be a response to infection or steroid treatment. Monitoring for signs of infection is crucial."

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hyperglycemia, and pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 250 mL, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and PEEP at 10 cmH2O. The patient's blood pressure is stable with a reading of 144/60 mmHg, heart rate is 85 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93% on 60% FiO2. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, lasix, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum culture is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) progression to pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient already has a confirmed DVT in the upper extremity. Regular assessment of lower extremities for signs of DVT and consideration of prophylactic anticoagulation therapy are essential.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting fluid and medication management accordingly are crucial"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**]
   with rare MRSA growth. Last dose of Vancomycin was yesterday. Diuresis
   was started yesterday with stable Cr at 2.6 this AM. IP came to see
   patient [**2191-4-13**] and would like vent setting of PEEP 8 and FiO2 50%
   prior to attempted trach and PEG.
   - Continue furosemide boluses with [**Hospital1 **] lytes to monitor renal function
   with goal net negative of 1.5 L over 24 hours
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips (increase methadone to 40 mg
   TID today)
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. PTT this AM
   was 64.9.
   - F/U lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid antibodies studies
   - Cont to follow coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Cont sq heparin for now, d/c if PTT supratherapeutic, start heparin
   drip at low rate today if PTT drops below 60 on evening PTT check
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr steadily
   downtrending at 2.6 today in face of diuresis yesterday. No longer
   struggling with hyperphosphatemia.
   - Will check PM lytes and I/O balance.
   - Discontinue calcium acetate
   - Renal consult following
   # Constipation:
   Patient has not stooled in several days. This likely attributable to
   massive doses of systemic opiates
   - Increase bowel regimen to lactulose per NG tube as well as soap suds
   enema
   - If lactulose fails, will consider PO narcan to relief constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.5 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia that has progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has tested positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in her sputum and BAL cultures. She has been receiving vancomycin therapy but still has persistent MRSA growth. 

The patient's kidney function is being closely monitored, as indicated by frequent checks on her serum creatinine levels. She has been on diuretics to manage fluid balance. 

She also has an elevated PTT, which could be due to heparin therapy or a coagulopathy. Further testing is planned to determine the cause of the elevated PTT. 

The patient's sedation requirement is high, and she is still requiring fentanyl and midazolam infusions despite attempts to wean her off them. 

There is a concern for constipation due to massive doses of systemic opiates. 

The patient's anemia is thought to be secondary to phlebotomy, but further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause. 

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and some permissive hypertension is being allowed in order to ensure adequate kidney perfusion. 

The patient's nutritional support is being provided through enteral nutrition.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] with rare MRSA
   growth.  Worsening peaks pressures this AM
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA, as Vanco level was 17.2 this AM, likely
   one additional dose of vancomycin today will complete her antibiotic
   course
   - Yesterday was last day of solumedrol
   - Will check PM lytes and begin diuresis with 10 mg IV furosemide if
   creatinine stable or continuing to improve
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - Contact IP today to let them know that trach and PEG are within
   immediate future for this patient
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. PTT today
   was 65.9.
   - F/U lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid antibodies studies
   - Cont to follow coags
   - Cont sq heparin for now, d/c if PTT supratherapeutic, start heparin
   drip at low rate today if PTT drops below 50 on evening PTT check
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her [**Last Name (un) **] includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitivity and specificity for AIN. Creatinine decreasing
   to 2.7 today.  Has had increasing UOP in the last 24 hours and
   auto-diuresed to negative fluid balance yesterday. Will  check PM lytes
   and I/O balance.
   - Renal consult following
   - Improved Cr today, will plan to initiate diuresis if creatinine on PM
   lytes check is stable or improved from this AM
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.4 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia progressing to ARDS. She has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's recent events include a consultation for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), improvement in creatinine levels, initiation of diuresis with Lasix, pending tests for lupus/anti-phospholipid antibodies, and a prolonged PTT. The patient's medical conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, DVT, renal failure, anemia, and hypertension/hypertension. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including Vancomycin, heparin, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and methadone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/60 to 170/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase, while showing decreased levels of potassium and bicarbonate. The patient's urine output has improved, and her sedation requirements are being managed with methadone and diazepam. The patient is expected to undergo tracheostomy and PEG placement in the near future.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS has resulted in severe hypoxemia, requiring mechanical ventilation. Continued monitoring and optimization of oxygenation parameters will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a left iliac vein clot extending into the subclavian vein. She is currently on subcutaneous heparin, and further evaluation for thrombophilia is planned.
3. Renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, suggesting renal dysfunction. The cause may be multifactorial, including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), or postrenal causes. Renal consult is planned to further investigate and manage the renal failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. This may be due to phlebotomy or other causes. Iron studies have ruled out iron deficiency anemia. The patient has received packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with a good response.
5. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with recent episodes of hypertension. This may be due to unmasked essential hypertension or incomplete sedation. Some permissive hypertension may be allowed to ensure adequate renal perfusion.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to sepsis or other causes. Monitoring of platelet levels and coagulation parameters is important.
7. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy with Vancomycin is ongoing. Surveillance cultures will be performed to guide further management.
8. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is receiving pantoprazole to prevent stress ulcers. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is necessary.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Measures such as deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and weaning trials will be important in reducing the risk.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is recommended for an accurate assessment and management of the patient's conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has been on a steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] with rare MRSA
   growth.  Worsening peaks pressures this AM
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA, as Vanco level was 17.2 this AM, likely
   one additional dose of vancomycin today will complete her antibiotic
   course
   - Yesterday was last day of solumedrol
   - Will check PM lytes and begin diuresis with 10 mg IV furosemide if
   creatinine stable or continuing to improve
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - Contact IP today to let them know that trach and PEG are within
   immediate future for this patient
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. PTT today
   was 65.9.
   - F/U lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid antibodies studies
   - Cont to follow coags
   - Cont sq heparin for now, d/c if PTT supratherapeutic, start heparin
   drip at low rate today if PTT drops below 50 on evening PTT check
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Likely multifactorial, differential for her [**Last Name (un) **] includes ATN (supported
   by appearance of muddy brown casts on sediment examination), CIN from
   recent dye exposure (however her Cr increased more quickly than
   expected after the contrast exposure), postrenal causes unlikely
   following renal U/S on [**2191-4-6**] without note of hydronephrosis or a
   combination of the above. Urine smear for eos was negative, however
   this has low sensitivity and specificity for AIN. Creatinine decreasing
   to 2.7 today.  Has had increasing UOP in the last 24 hours and
   auto-diuresed to negative fluid balance yesterday. Will  check PM lytes
   and I/O balance.
   - Renal consult following
   - Improved Cr today, will plan to initiate diuresis if creatinine on PM
   lytes check is stable or improved from this AM
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.4 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.
   - Continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia, which progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxemia. MRSA was identified in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures. The patient's sedation requirement has been high due to ventilator dyssynchrony. Methadone and diazepam infusions were initiated to reduce sedation and potentially wean off fentanyl and midazolam drips, but the patient still requires reduced doses of fentanyl and versed.

The patient's peaks pressures have worsened, and she has an elevated PTT without systemic anticoagulation. She has a left iliac vein clot extending into the subclavian vein, and her PICC line was removed. The cause of the elevated PTT is unclear, as it could be due to heparin therapy, a clotting factor deficiency, or a hypercoagulable state. Further evaluation of lupus anticoagulant and anti-phospholipid antibodies is planned.

The patient's renal function has improved, with a decreasing creatinine level. She may be started on diuretics if her creatinine remains stable or improves. Anemia has been managed with packed red blood cell transfusions, and iron studies do not indicate iron deficiency anemia. Hypotension and hypertension have been observed, and permissive hypertension is allowed to ensure adequate kidney"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with an admission for pneumonia that progressed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and is currently on Vancomycin. The patient has a history of pernicious anemia, but her B12 levels are within normal range. She has shown improvement in her creatinine levels and is now able to produce good urine output after foley repositioning. The patient's PTT is elevated, and further investigation into lupus/anti-phospholipid antibodies is pending. She has developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has an elevated D-dimer level. The patient's anemia is thought to be secondary to phlebotomy, but her iron studies do not indicate iron deficiency anemia. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with a good response. The patient's blood pressure has recently become hypertensive, and some permissive hypertension is being allowed to ensure adequate renal perfusion. The patient is expected to undergo tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in the near future. Her code status remains as full code.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and anxiety. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. The note mentions the following:
- Consultation for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is planned for Monday if the patient's FiO2 is down to 50% and PEEP is at least 8.
- The patient's creatinine (Cr) level improved to 2.6 mg/dL and diuresis with lasix was initiated, resulting in good urine output after foley repositioning.
- Lupus/anti-phospholipid antibody testing is pending.
- Prothrombin time (PTT) remains elevated, with a plan to administer heparin if PTT <60.
- Vancomycin was given as a single dose.
- The patient was briefly on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with an arterial blood gas (ABG) taken.
- A peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed.
- The patient has a known allergy to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), which caused hives.
- The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on April 13th, 01:30 PM.
- The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam.
- Other medications administered include heparin sodium, pantoprazole, furosemide, and methadone.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results are provided in the flow sheet data.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and may be at risk for further infections due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to further deterioration of renal function if not properly managed.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, which can result in respiratory failure if not adequately supported with mechanical ventilation.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperosmolar coma if not controlled.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Anxiety: The patient has anxiety, which may wors"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of altered mental status, constipation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and anxiety. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is no mention of allergies in the provided information.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's respiratory failure and ARDS may require prolonged mechanical ventilation, which can lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, and muscle weakness.
2. Nosocomial infections: Being in the ICU, the patient is at risk of developing nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) progression: The patient already has a confirmed DVT in the upper extremity. If left untreated or not properly managed, it can progress to a pulmonary embolism, which is a life-threatening condition.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels. If not appropriately managed, AKI can lead to chronic kidney disease or require renal replacement therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**]
   with rare MRSA growth. Last dose of Vancomycin was yesterday. Diuresis
   was started yesterday with stable Cr at 2.6 this AM. IP came to see
   patient [**2191-4-13**] and would like vent setting of PEEP 8 and FiO2 50%
   prior to attempted trach and PEG.
   - Continue furosemide boluses with [**Hospital1 **] lytes to monitor renal function
   with goal net negative of 1.5 L over 24 hours
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips (increase methadone to 40 mg
   TID today)
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. PTT this AM
   was 64.9.
   - F/U lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid antibodies studies
   - Cont to follow coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Cont sq heparin for now, d/c if PTT supratherapeutic, start heparin
   drip at low rate today if PTT drops below 60 on evening PTT check
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr steadily
   downtrending at 2.6 today in face of diuresis yesterday. No longer
   struggling with hyperphosphatemia.
   - Will check PM lytes and I/O balance.
   - Discontinue calcium acetate
   - Renal consult following
   # Constipation:
   Patient has not stooled in several days. This likely attributable to
   massive doses of systemic opiates
   - Increase bowel regimen to lactulose per NG tube as well as soap suds
   enema
   - If lactulose fails, will consider PO narcan to relief constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.5 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia that has progressed to ARDS.
- She has been intubated and sedated due to ventilator dyssynchrony.
- MRSA was identified in the sputum and BAL cultures.
- The patient has completed a steroid taper and is still requiring sedation from fentanyl and midazolam drips.
- Methadone and diazepam IV were initiated to address sedation difficulties, but the patient still requires reduced doses of fentanyl and versed drips.
- Diuresis was started yesterday with stable creatinine at 2.6 this morning.
- The patient has a history of pernicious anemia, but B12 levels are within normal limits as of [**2191-4-11**].
- There is evidence of left Iliad clot extending into the subclavian vein, and the line was removed.
- The patient's PTT was elevated initially without systemic anticoagulation.
- The patient has anemia with a HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**], which is thought to be secondary to phlebotomy.
- Iron studies performed on [**2191-4-9**] showed a ferritin of 346 and an iron saturation of 25%, not consistent with iron deficiency anemia.
- The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with good response several days ago and is now stable with a HCT of 26.5 this morning.
- The patient has been hypertensive recently, likely either unmasked essential hypertension or incomplete sedation.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 111 and 156 mg/dL.
- The patient has not had a bowel movement for several days, likely due to massive doses of systemic opiates.
- The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator mode, set Vt of 260 mL, RR set at 36, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 55%, and SpO2 of 96%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and ARDS, there is a risk of developing VAP. Surveillance cultures and conservative ABG will be followed to guide ventilator settings, and nebs will be administered as needed.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been found to have a left Iliad clot extending into the subclavian vein. The line was removed, and the patient is currently on subcutaneous heparin. Further evaluation of coagulation factors is needed, including lupus anticoagulant and anti-phospholipid antibody studies.
3. Acute kidney injury (AK"

   - Continue furosemide boluses with [**Hospital1 **] lytes to monitor renal function
   with goal net negative of 1.5 L over 24 hours
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam titrated up as needed to allow
   liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips (increase methadone to 40 mg
   TID today)
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. PTT this AM
   was 64.9.
   - F/U lupus anti-coagulant and anti-phospholipid antibodies studies
   - Cont to follow coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Cont sq heparin for now, d/c if PTT supratherapeutic, start heparin
   drip at low rate today if PTT drops below 60 on evening PTT check
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr steadily
   downtrending at 2.6 today in face of diuresis yesterday. No longer
   struggling with hyperphosphatemia.
   - Will check PM lytes and I/O balance.
   - Discontinue calcium acetate
   - Renal consult following
   # Constipation:
   Patient has not stooled in several days. This likely attributable to
   massive doses of systemic opiates
   - Increase bowel regimen to lactulose per NG tube as well as soap suds
   enema
   - If lactulose fails, will consider PO narcan to relief constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.5 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia that developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has shown improvement in her condition, with stable creatinine levels and good response to diuresis. However, she still requires sedation and ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS has caused severe lung damage, leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient was found to have a left internal jugular vein clot extending into the subclavian vein. The central line was removed, but her PTT was elevated initially without systemic anticoagulation. She is currently on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis and will be monitored closely.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's initial renal function tests indicated acute kidney injury. However, her creatinine levels have been steadily decreasing, suggesting improvement. Close monitoring of renal function and diuresis will continue.

4. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement in several days, likely due to massive doses of systemic opiates. Increasing the bowel regimen and considering a sodium bicarbonate enema will help relieve constipation.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**]
   with rare MRSA growth. Last dose of Vancomycin was yesterday. IP came
   to see patient [**2191-4-13**] and would like vent setting of PEEP 8 and FiO2
   50% prior to attempted trach and PEG. Encouraging that drip sedation
   being liberated little by little and FiO2 is down to 55% today. Has
   ongoing diuresis with stable Cr at 2.5 today.
   - Continue furosemide boluses with [**Hospital1 **] lytes to monitor renal function
   with goal net negative of 1.5 L over 24 hours
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route) titrated up as needed to
   allow liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - Discontinue esophageal balloon
   - Start slow PEEP taper today
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. PTT this AM
   was 81.8.
   - F/U ACA antibodies
   - Hematology consult for positive lupus anticoagulant as well as
   positive inhibitor screen in setting of new DVT, likely complicated by
   subcutaneous heparin administration
   - Cont to follow coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Cont sq heparin for now, d/c if PTT supratherapeutic, start heparin
   drip at low rate today if PTT drops below 60 on evening PTT check
   - Hold heparin subcutaneous starting Saturday in anticipation of Monday
   procedures
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr steadily
   downtrending at 2.5 today in face of diuresis yesterday. No longer
   struggling with hyperphosphatemia.
   - Will check PM lytes and I/O balance.
   - Discontinued calcium acetate
   # Constipation:
   Patient with two large stools yesterday.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, will consider PO narcan to relief constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent

   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.5 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. She has completed a steroid taper and has been on ventilatory support. The patient has MRSA pneumonia and has shown some improvement in oxygen saturation levels. She is still requiring sedation and has ongoing diuresis with stable creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is her hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS. This condition can lead to inadequate oxygenation of tissues and organs, potentially resulting in multi-organ dysfunction or failure.

2. MRSA Infection: The patient has MRSA pneumonia, which increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and treatment challenges. If not appropriately managed, the infection may worsen or spread to other parts of the body.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a left internal jugular vein DVT extending into the subclavian vein. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.

4. Lupus Anticoagulant and Positive Inhibitor Screen: The patient has tested positive for lupus anticoagulant and an inhibitor screen. This finding may complicate anticoagulation therapy and increase the risk of bleeding or clotting disorders.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a HCT of 22.2"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory distress, and renal failure. The patient has been diuresed with furosemide and has had two large soft bowel movements. Allergies include hives from sulfonamide antibiotics. The patient is currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions, as well as other medications including heparin, pantoprazole, and furosemide.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 174/78 mmHg to 182/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,257 mL, including 470 mL through PO, 600 mL through TF, and 477 mL through IVF. Output includes 2,990 mL of urine and 1,040 mL of blood products.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 260 mL, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 55%, and plateau pressure of 43 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 57 mmHg, and PaO2 of 142 mmHg.

Physical examination findings include a right radial pulse not assessed, left radial pulse not assessed, right DP pulse not assessed, and left DP pulse not assessed. Skin, neurologic, and peripheral vascular examinations were also not assessed.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count of 271 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, sodium of 111 mg/dL, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride of 76 mg/dL, bicarbonate of 30 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen of 27.7%, creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL, glucose of 156 mg/dL, and platelet count of 278 K/uL.

Assessment and plan include altered mental status, constipation, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity, alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, community-acquired pneumonia, anxiety, and ICU care including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary complications: Given the presence of ARDS, the patient is at risk for further respiratory deterioration and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not properly managed.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and underlying conditions increase the risk for DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prophylaxed appropriately.
4. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the underlying medical conditions, increasing the risk for hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's constipation and alteration in nutrition may increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and potential cardiac history increase the risk for cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure exacerbation.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high glucose levels require careful monitoring and management to prevent complications related to hyperglycemia.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobilization and altered mental status increase the risk for developing pressure ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**]
   with rare MRSA growth. Last dose of Vancomycin was yesterday. IP came
   to see patient [**2191-4-13**] and would like vent setting of PEEP 8 and FiO2
   50% prior to attempted trach and PEG. Encouraging that drip sedation
   being liberated little by little and FiO2 is down to 55% today. Has
   ongoing diuresis with stable Cr
   - Continue furosemide boluses with [**Hospital1 **] lytes to monitor renal function
   with goal net negative
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route) titrated up as needed to
   allow liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - esophageal balloon taken out
   - cont slow PEEP taper
   - PIP/Plateau levels persistently high today, ETT on AM CXR appears to
   abut carina.  Will pull back ETT and redo CXR and then reassess
   respiratory mechanics.
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state.
   - F/U ACA antibodies
   - Hematology consult for positive lupus anticoagulant as well as
   positive inhibitor screen in setting of new DVT, likely complicated by
   subcutaneous heparin administration.  Recs avoid hydralazine, would not
   use IV heparin, cannot use lovenox due to renal function
   - Cont to follow coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold heparin subcutaneous today in anticipation of Monday procedures
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr steadily
   downtrending at 2.5 today in face of diuresis yesterday. No longer
   struggling with hyperphosphatemia.
   - Will check PM lytes and I/O balance.
   - Discontinued calcium acetate
   - patient with slowly increasing hypernatremia, will increase free
   water flushes to 150cc q6.
   # Constipation:
   Patient with two large stools yesterday.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, will consider PO narcan to relief constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.5 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.
   - Continue to monitor
   - will increase diltiazem to 60mg qid

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to MRSA pneumonia. The patient has a history of pneumonia that progressed to ARDS, and she is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has ongoing diuresis with stable creatinine levels and is being monitored for renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient has been hypertensive recently, which may be due to unmasked essential hypertension or incomplete sedation. It is important to monitor blood pressure and allow some permissive hypertension to ensure adequate kidney perfusion.
2. DVT: The patient was found to have a left internal jugular vein (L-IJ) clot extending into the subclavian vein. The line was removed, but the patient's PTT was elevated without systemic anticoagulation. There is uncertainty about whether this rise in PTT is due to heparin or a hypercoagulable state.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of pernicious anemia, and her HCT has been steadily decreasing during the ICU course. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) with a good response and is now stable with an HCT of 26.5.
4. Constipation: The patient had two large stools yesterday, indicating that her constipation is improving. She will continue to receive lactulose"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**]
   with rare MRSA growth. Last dose of Vancomycin was yesterday. IP came
   to see patient [**2191-4-13**] and would like vent setting of PEEP 8 and FiO2
   50% prior to attempted trach and PEG. Encouraging that drip sedation
   being liberated little by little and FiO2 is down to 55% today. Has
   ongoing diuresis with stable Cr
   - Continue furosemide boluses with [**Hospital1 **] lytes to monitor renal function
   with goal net negative
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route) titrated up as needed to
   allow liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - esophageal balloon taken out
   - cont slow PEEP taper
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state.
   - F/U ACA antibodies
   - Hematology consult for positive lupus anticoagulant as well as
   positive inhibitor screen in setting of new DVT, likely complicated by
   subcutaneous heparin administration
   - Cont to follow coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold heparin subcutaneous today in anticipation of Monday procedures
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr steadily
   downtrending at 2.5 today in face of diuresis yesterday. No longer
   struggling with hyperphosphatemia.
   - Will check PM lytes and I/O balance.
   - Discontinued calcium acetate
   # Constipation:
   Patient with two large stools yesterday.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, will consider PO narcan to relief constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.5 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old female with an admission for pneumonia that has developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) show Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) with a clot extending into the subclavian vein. The central line was removed, but the patient's partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was elevated initially without systemic anticoagulation. It is unclear if this rise in PTT is due to subcutaneous heparin or a hypercoagulable state. The patient also tested positive for lupus anticoagulant.

The patient's kidney function has improved, and the creatinine level is now 2.5. The patient previously had acute tubular necrosis (ATN), but it is resolving. The patient's anemia is secondary to phlebotomy and possibly pernicious anemia, for which she received packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with recent episodes of hypertension. This could be due to unmasked essential hypertension or incomplete sedation. The goal is to allow some permissive hypertension for adequate renal perfusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a known thrombus in the left internal jugular vein. They have a history of allergies to sulfa antibiotics and a previous dose of vancomycin given on 04/13/2191 at 01:30 PM. The patient is currently on fentanyl infusion at a rate of 100 mcg/hour and receiving other ICU medications including Furosemide (Lasix) given on 04/15/2191 at 02:00 PM. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the presence of thrombus in the L IJ.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate between 82-91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/59 mmHg to 175/78 mmHg, respiratory rate between 10-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,379 mL with 329 mL given via PO and 424 mL given via IVF. Total output is 2,325 mL with 310 mL being urine output. There is a negative fluid balance of -946 mL. 

The patient is intubated and sedated, with no follow-up commands. Physical examination findings include brisk pupil response bilaterally, no pallor, no cervical LAD,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple medical conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, acute renal failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hyperglycemia, and constipation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving supplemental oxygen and assisted ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 175/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the ARDS progresses or if there are complications related to the mechanical ventilation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This condition can worsen if not properly managed with appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can lead to further deterioration of kidney function if not addressed promptly.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He is currently receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and heparin.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 164/72 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His temperature is within normal range at 36.9°C.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,735 mL and output of 2,440 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 705 mL. His urine output is 2,340 mL, indicating good renal function.

The patient's laboratory results reveal a white blood cell count of 9.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, sodium of 130 mg/dL, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 111 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 95%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 31 mEq/L. These results indicate normal acid-base balance.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the peripheral vascular system, skin, or neurologic assessment. However, his respiratory support indicates the use of an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 260 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 36 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 55%.

The patient's assessment and plan include several conditions such as altered mental status, constipation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia, anxiety, and ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated for an extended period increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and hypercoagulability can lead to the formation of blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially dislodge and travel to the lungs.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring healthcare-associated infections.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function, which may worsen due to factors such as fluid overload or nephrotoxic medications.
5. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and pressure from the endotracheal tube can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, especially with prolonged sedation and ICU stay.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**]
   with rare MRSA growth. Last dose of Vancomycin was yesterday. IP came
   to see patient [**2191-4-13**] and would like vent setting of PEEP 8 and FiO2
   50% prior to attempted trach and PEG. Encouraging that drip sedation
   being liberated little by little and FiO2 is down to 55% today. Has
   ongoing diuresis with stable Cr

   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route) titrated up as needed to
   allow liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - esophageal balloon taken out

   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state.
   - F/U ACA antibodies
   - daily coags
   - Hematology consult for positive lupus anticoagulant as well as
   positive inhibitor screen in setting of new DVT, likely complicated by
   subcutaneous heparin administration.  Recs avoid hydralazine, would not
   use IV heparin, cannot use lovenox due to renal function
   - Cont to follow coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold heparin subcutaneous today in anticipation of Monday procedures
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr steadily
   downtrending at 2.5 today in face of diuresis yesterday. No longer
   struggling with hyperphosphatemia.  Continues to have increasing
   sodium.
   - Will check PM lytes and I/O balance.
   - Discontinued calcium acetate
   - will change free water flushes to 150cc q4.
   # Constipation:
   Patient with two large stools yesterday.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, will consider PO narcan to relief constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.5 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia, which developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
- She has MRSA pneumonia and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has been sedated due to ventilator dyssynchrony but is slowly being weaned off sedation.
- There have been attempts to extubate the patient, but she requires continued ventilatory support.
- The patient has a history of pernicious anemia and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with a good response.
- She has ongoing diuresis with stable creatinine levels and will start Lasix gtt for increased diuresis.
- The patient has a left internal jugular (L-IJ) clot extending into the subclavian, and the line was removed.
- The patient's PTT was elevated initially without systemic anticoagulation, and it is unclear if this rise in PTT is due to heparin subcutaneous, a hypercoagulable state, or a deficiency in a clotting factor.
- The patient has a positive lupus anticoagulant and inhibitor screen, which complicates the management of her DVT.
- The patient's sodium levels are increasing, and her electrolytes and I/O balance should be monitored.
- The patient is at risk for constipation, and lactulose PO and PR will be continued"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with an admission for pneumonia that progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The patient has completed a steroid taper, but still requires high levels of sedation due to ventilator dyssynchrony. The patient's sedation is being managed with methadone and diazepam, but she is still on reduced doses of fentanyl and midazolam infusions. The patient's FiO2 has been decreased to 55% today, and there is ongoing diuresis with stable creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
2. MRSA infection: The presence of MRSA in the sputum and BAL cultures indicates a bacterial infection that may require appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient was found to have a left iliac vein clot extending into the subclavian vein. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.
4. Coagulation issues: The patient has an elevated PTT despite subcutaneous heparin administration. This could indicate the presence of a coagulation inhibitor, such as lupus anticoagulant or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
5. Renal function: The patient's renal function is currently stable, but there are concerns about ongoing diuresis and the need for careful monitoring of electrolyte balance and fluid intake/output.
6. Anemia: The patient's HCT has been trending down during the ICU course and was found to be 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**]. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) with a good response, and the HCT is now stable at 26.5.
7. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient has recently been hypertensive, which may be due to unmasked essential hypertension or incomplete sedation. Some permissive hypertension is being allowed to ensure adequate renal perfusion.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, and deep vein thrombosis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and has a PICC line for fluid administration. He is receiving heparin for DVT prophylaxis and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 104 to 180 mmHg, heart rate between 64 and 89 bpm, respiratory rate between 36-45 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and increased creatinine levels. The patient's renal function is improving, but he remains on diuretics. There are no significant findings on the physical examination, and the patient's neurological status is not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is already receiving heparin for DVT prophylaxis, which helps prevent the formation of blood clots in the deep veins. However, there is still a risk of developing a DVT due to immobility and other risk factors associated with critical illness.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition involves respiratory failure and staphynergia pneumonia, which can worsen his"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**]
   with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. IP came to see
   patient [**2191-4-13**] and would like vent setting of PEEP 8 and FiO2 50%
   prior to attempted trach and PEG. Encouraging that drip sedation being
   liberated little by little and FiO2 is down to 55%. Has ongoing
   diuresis with stable Cr
   - will cont lasix gtt for increased diuresis
   - decreased RR with permissive hypercapnea in attempt to decrease PIP,
   will cont to attempt wean settings
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route) titrated up as needed to
   allow liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - esophageal balloon taken out
   - cont slow PEEP taper
   - f/u with IP re:plan for trach and PEG this week,
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. ACA
   antibodies, IgG positive, IgM negative
   - daily coags
   - Hematology consult for positive lupus anticoagulant as well as
   positive inhibitor screen in setting of new DVT, likely complicated by
   subcutaneous heparin administration.  Recs avoid hydralazine, would not
   use IV heparin, cannot use lovenox due to renal function
   - Cont to follow coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - plan to hold heparin subcutaneous today in anticipation of potential
   procedures
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr steadily
   downtrending at 2.1 today with continued diuresis. No longer struggling
   with hyperphosphatemia.  Continues to have high relatively sodium but
   improved.
   - follow lytes and I/O balance.
   - Discontinued calcium acetate
   - free water flushes at 150cc q4.
   # Constipation:
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relief constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.5 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   - plan transfusion if HgB <7
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was admitted for pneumonia that developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The patient has completed a course of Vancomycin.

The patient has been requiring high levels of sedation due to ventilator dyssynchrony. To address this, methadone and diazepam IV were initiated, but the patient still requires reduced doses of fentanyl and midazolam drips. The patient's oxygen saturation is being closely monitored, and there has been some improvement with FiO2 reduced to 55%.

The patient has ongoing diuresis with stable creatinine levels. Lasix infusion is being continued for increased diuresis, and there is a plan to taper PEEP slowly. The patient's tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement are being planned for this week.

The patient was found to have a left iliac vein thrombus extending into the subclavian vein. The central line was removed, but the patient's Prothrombin Time (PTT) was elevated initially without systemic anticoagulation. The patient has positive lupus anticoagulant antibodies and an inhibitor screen, suggesting a hypercoagulable"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not explicitly mentioned. However, the 24-hour events indicate that the patient's PTT was elevated to 103.6, leading to the holding of midnight heparin injection. There are plans to potentially perform a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for the patient, but this may require an emergent surgical airway if the patient continues to have FiO2 elevated above 50% and PEEP > 8.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**]
   with rare MRSA growth. Last dose of Vancomycin was yesterday. IP came
   to see patient [**2191-4-13**] and would like vent setting of PEEP 8 and FiO2
   50% prior to attempted trach and PEG. Encouraging that drip sedation
   being liberated little by little and FiO2 is down to 55% today. Has
   ongoing diuresis with stable Cr
   - will start lasix gtt for increased diuresis
   - will decrease RR with permissive hypercapnea in attempt to decrease
   PIP
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route) titrated up as needed to
   allow liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - esophageal balloon taken out
   - cont slow PEEP taper
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state.
   - F/U ACA antibodies
   - daily coags
   - Hematology consult for positive lupus anticoagulant as well as
   positive inhibitor screen in setting of new DVT, likely complicated by
   subcutaneous heparin administration.  Recs avoid hydralazine, would not
   use IV heparin, cannot use lovenox due to renal function
   - Cont to follow coags [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold heparin subcutaneous today in anticipation of Monday procedures
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr steadily
   downtrending at 2.5 today in face of diuresis yesterday. No longer
   struggling with hyperphosphatemia.  Continues to have increasing
   sodium.
   - Will check PM lytes and I/O balance.
   - Discontinued calcium acetate
   - will change free water flushes to 150cc q4.
   # Constipation:
   Patient with two large stools yesterday.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, will consider PO narcan to relief constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.5 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   - plan transfusion if HgB <7
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia developing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has shown MRSA in her sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient is intubated and sedated due to ventilator dyssynchrony. Methadone and diazepam have been initiated to attempt to liberate her from the fentanyl and midazolam drips, but she still requires reduced doses of these medications. The patient also has a left internal jugular vein thrombus extending into the subclavian vein, which was removed, and her PTT was elevated initially without systemic anticoagulation. She has been found to have a positive lupus anticoagulant with a titer of 1:80 and a positive inhibitor screen. There is uncertainty regarding the elevated PTT, whether it represents anticoagulation or a hypercoagulable state. The patient's renal function is stable with a creatinine of 2.5, and she is undergoing diuresis with Lasix. She has ongoing diuresis with stable creatinine and will start Lasix gtt for increased diuresis. The patient's sodium levels are increasing, and she has hyperphosphatemia. She has a history of anemia, which is thought to be secondary to phlebotomy, but her ferritin and iron saturation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia that has progressed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia and has completed a course of Vancomycin. The patient is also suspected to have deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which was found in the left internal jugular vein. She has an elevated PTT and positive lupus anticoagulant, indicating a hypercoagulable state. The patient's kidney function has improved with stable creatinine levels, and she is undergoing diuresis. She also has anemia with a hemoglobin concentration of 22.2, which is being treated with packed red blood cell transfusions. Her blood pressure is being managed with diltiazem, and she is on multiple medications for sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and surveillance cultures are recommended.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVT and is at increased risk for developing further thrombotic events. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued, and regular monitoring of coagulation parameters is essential.

   Disposition:
","The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications. Based on the information provided in the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) - The patient has been diagnosed with a DVT in the upper extremity. This is a serious condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, typically in the legs. If the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs, it can cause a pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) - The patient is experiencing acute lung injury and has been diagnosed with ARDS. ARDS is a severe condition that occurs when the lungs become inflamed and filled with fluid, making it difficult to breathe. It can be caused by various factors, including infections, trauma, or inhalation injuries.

3. Renal Failure - The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure. This means that the kidneys are not able to adequately filter waste products from the blood, resulting in a buildup of toxins and electrolyte imbalances. Renal failure can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and appropriately.

4. Pneumonia - The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs that can cause symptoms such as cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. If left untreated, pneumonia can worsen the patient's respiratory status and lead to"

   dysynchrony.
   Needs trach, but still on too much PEEP and FiO2.  If oxygenation
   improves, can lower FiO2 and/or PEEP.
   coagulopathy:  possible lupus anticoag.  On s/q heparin and PTT is up,
   unclear if its due to lupus anticoagulant or due to s/q heparine.
   HOTN:  Improved, not on pressors.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe late-stage ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) from nosocomial MRSA pneumonia. She also has acute renal failure (ARF), a right internal jugular vein (RIJ) clot, and possible +lupus anticoagulant. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 260 mL and a respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 55%, and the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is at 10 cmH2O. The patient's blood pressure is 110/50 mmHg, heart rate is 87 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95%. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 211 K/uL, sodium level of 135 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, and glucose level of 121 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis reveals a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 124 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient's physical examination findings include crackles in the respiratory chest, warm skin, and no distress. Neurological examination is not assessed due to the patient's inability to follow commands or respond appropriately. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, coagulopathy, and hot neural neuropathy (HOTN). The patient's ARDS and ventilator dependence increase the risk of respiratory failure. The presence of a RIJ clot and possible +lupus anticoagulant indicate a coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding or thrombotic events. HOTN is indicated by the patient's inability to stand and the presence of sensory deficits."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**]
   with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. IP came to see
   patient [**2191-4-13**] and would like vent setting of PEEP 8 and FiO2 50%
   prior to attempted trach and PEG. Encouraging that drip sedation being
   liberated little by little and FiO2 is down to 55% with PEEP of 5 now.
   Has ongoing diuresis with stable Cr
   - will cont lasix gtt for increased diuresis
   - decreased RR with permissive hypercapnea in attempt to decrease PIP,
   will cont to attempt wean settings
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route) titrated up as needed to
   allow liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - esophageal balloon taken out
   - cont slow PEEP taper
   - f/u with IP re:plan for trach and PEG (current plan for Thurs)
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. ACA
   antibodies, IgG positive, IgM negative. Heme consulted and given lupus
   anticoagulant positive and low heparin level, patient is likely not
   anticoagulated and PTT cannot be used to follow heparin. Since pending
   procedure, not starting anticoagulation now, but will need plan for
   anticoagulation after trach and PEG
   - daily coags
   - appreciate Hematology consult re: positive lupus anticoagulant and
   now low heparin level in setting of new DVT. Recs avoid hydralazine,
   cannot use lovenox due to renal function, will need to consider how to
   anticoagulate. Plan for now is to have trach and PEG on thurs so will
   start a heparin drip and follow heparin levels rather than PTT. Heparin
   level can be ordered stat and takes approximately 4 hours to return.
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr steadily
   downtrending at 2.1 today with continued diuresis. No longer struggling
   with hyperphosphatemia.  High sodium has improved.
   - follow lytes and I/O balance.
   - Discontinued calcium acetate
   - free water flushes at 150cc q4.
   # Constipation:
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relieve constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.5 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   - plan transfusion if HgB <7
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia that has developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and has completed a course of Vancomycin. She has ongoing diuresis with stable creatinine levels and is being weaned off sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to respiratory failure.
2. DVT: The patient has been found to have a left iliac vein clot extending into the subclavian vein. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not properly managed.
3. Lupus anticoagulant: The patient tested positive for lupus anticoagulant, which can affect the effectiveness of heparin therapy and make it difficult to monitor anticoagulation status.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 22.2. This may be due to phlebotomy or a history of pernicious anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
5. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient has fluctuating blood pressure levels, which need to be closely monitored and managed to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
6. Constipation: The patient is at risk of constipation, which can be managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**]
   with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. IP came to see
   patient [**2191-4-13**] and would like vent setting of PEEP 8 and FiO2 50%
   prior to attempted trach and PEG. Encouraging that drip sedation being
   liberated little by little and FiO2 is down to 55% with PEEP of 5 now.
   Has ongoing diuresis with stable Cr
   - will cont lasix gtt for increased diuresis
   - decreased RR with permissive hypercapnea in attempt to decrease PIP,
   will cont to attempt wean settings
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route) titrated up as needed to
   allow liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN

   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. ACA
   antibodies, IgG positive, IgM negative. Heme consulted and given lupus
   anticoagulant positive and low heparin level, patient is likely not
   anticoagulated and PTT cannot be used to follow heparin. Since pending
   procedure, not starting anticoagulation now, but will need plan for
   anticoagulation after trach and PEG
   - daily coags
   - appreciate Hematology consult re: positive lupus anticoagulant and
   now low heparin level in setting of new DVT. Recs avoid hydralazine,
   cannot use lovenox due to renal function, will need to consider how to
   anticoagulate after trach and PEG. One option may to follow heparin
   levels or follow INR for argatroban

   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with an admission for pneumonia developing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated and sedated due to ventilator dyssynchrony. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing ARDS, which is a serious condition that can lead to severe respiratory failure and may require advanced interventions such as tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) to manage long-term ventilation and nutrition.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been found to have a left iliac vein clot extending into the subclavian vein. This clot was removed, but the patient's PTT was initially elevated without systemic anticoagulation. It is unclear if this rise in PTT is due to heparin, a deficiency in clotting factors, or a hypercoagulable state. The patient has positive lupus anticoagulant antibodies, and her heparin level is low, indicating that she is likely not anticoagulated. The PTT cannot be used to follow heparin in this case. Therefore, a plan for anticoagulation after tracheostomy and PEG will be needed.

3. Renal function: The patient's creatinine levels have been steadily decreasing, indicating improving renal function."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but the note mentions several significant events related to their health.

The patient has been weaned to PEEP 5 and FiO2 55%, indicating some improvement in their respiratory status. However, the patient is still intubated and sedated. They have a positive lupus anticoagulant test and a low heparin level, suggesting a possible bleeding risk. Therefore, anticoagulation management will be necessary after the tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient's allergies include sulfa medications, which can cause hives as a reaction. The last dose of antibiotics administered is not specified.

In terms of infusions, the patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 1 mg/hour and fentanyl (Concentrate) at 50 mcg/hour. Furosemide (Lasix) is being given at a rate of 2 mg/hour.

The patient's medical and family history remains unchanged from admission. Review of systems is also unchanged except for the noted below.

Flow sheet data indicates the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their blood glucose levels have been within a relatively stable range.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure:  MRSA PNA and ARDS.  Still requiring very high
   peak pressures, but may be related to tortuous trachea.  Will
   do bronch today to visualize tracheal position.  To get trach on
   Thursday.
   Sedation:  On valium and po methadone and fentanyl.  Will go down on
   drips. and try bolus sedation.
   Left IJ clot and Lupus anticoagulant positive.  Heparin level is low,
   so PTT elevation is due to antiphosphlipid antibodes.  Should be
   anticoagulated.
   As per heme will start heparin and start heparin levels.
   Acute renal faiure:  Creatinine is stable with diuresis
   TFs had high residuals yesterday.  Will try and restart today.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. IP
   planning for trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**] if vent settings (FiO2 and
   PEEP) are low enough to allow. Has ongoing diuresis with stable Cr.
   Aside from desaturation last night requiring increase in FiO2 to 70%,
   patient had been doing well at reduced vent settings. During
   bronchoscopy on [**2191-4-19**] was discovered that patient had tip of ET
   tube against tracheal wall. This appeared to contribute to high peak
   inspiratory pressures and thus ET tube was repositioned.
   - Liberate from FiO2 of 70% down to lower level compatible with
   procedures tomorrow
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Remain off  fentanyl and midazolam drips
   - Stop tube feeds at midnight tonight and heparin drip off at 0400 on
   [**2191-4-21**] in anticipation of trach and PEG
   - Discontinue furosemide drip and return to bolus furosemide for goal
   of -1L daily
   # Fever:
   Spike to 101.5 this AM is first temperature spike since hospitalized in
   ICU here. Urine, blood, sputum, stool cultures sent. Concern for
   hospital-acquired infection. No evidence of skin breakdown.
   - Follow-up pending cultures.
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. ACA
   antibodies, IgG positive, IgM negative. Heme consulted and given lupus
   anticoagulant positive and low heparin level, patient is likely not
   anticoagulated and PTT cannot be used to follow heparin. Heparin drip
   was begun on [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being
   used to titrate heparin drip.
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (ordered STAT
   and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Heparin drip off at 0400 on [**2191-4-21**] for trach and PEG
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr stable at
   2.1 today with continued diuresis.
   - follow lytes and I/O balance
   - Discontinued calcium acetate
   - free water flushes at 150cc q4
   # Constipation:
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relieve constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT slowly downtrending to 21.6 today. Stool is guaiac negative. Likely
   all related to phlebotomy
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBCs today
   - Minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   Allowing for some permission hypertension for renal perfusion; however,
   will consider tighter control.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU for pneumonia that has progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures showed Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for which the patient completed a course of Vancomycin. The patient's condition has improved, and she is now doing well on bolus fentanyl and midazolam, with reduced ventilator settings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia puts her at risk for worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Hospital-acquired infection: The patient's spike in fever this morning raises concerns for a hospital-acquired infection. Cultures have been sent, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient was found to have a left internal jugular vein clot extending into the subclavian vein. Initially, her Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) was elevated without systemic anticoagulation. The cause of the elevated PTT is unclear, as it could be due to heparin therapy, a clotting factor deficiency, or hypercoagulable state. The patient's lupus anticoagulant status is positive,"

   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Has had a
   high sedation requirement due to vent dyssynchrony when sedation
   lightened. To address sedation difficulty and attempt to liberate from
   fentanyl and midaz drips we initiated methadone and diazepam IV;
   however, she is still requiring the fentanyl and versed drips though at
   reduced doses. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**]
   with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. IP came to see
   patient [**2191-4-13**] and would like vent setting of PEEP 8 and FiO2 50%
   prior to attempted trach and PEG. Encouraging that drip sedation being
   liberated little by little and FiO2 is down to 55% with PEEP of 5 now.
   Has ongoing diuresis with stable Cr
   - will cont lasix gtt for increased diuresis
   - decreased RR with permissive hypercapnea in attempt to decrease PIP,
   will cont to attempt wean settings
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route) titrated up as needed to
   allow liberation from fentanyl and midaz drips
   - Cont to follow oxygen sats and conservative ABG to guide ventilator
   settings, nebs PRN
   - esophageal balloon taken out
   - cont slow PEEP taper
   - f/u with IP re:plan for trach and PEG (current plan for Thurs)
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. ACA
   antibodies, IgG positive, IgM negative. Heme consulted and given lupus
   anticoagulant positive and low heparin level, patient is likely not
   anticoagulated and PTT cannot be used to follow heparin. Since pending
   procedure, not starting anticoagulation now, but will need plan for
   anticoagulation after trach and PEG
   - daily coags
   - appreciate Hematology consult re: positive lupus anticoagulant and
   now low heparin level in setting of new DVT. Recs avoid hydralazine,
   cannot use lovenox due to renal function, will need to consider how to
   anticoagulate. Plan for now is to have trach and PEG on thurs so will
   start a heparin drip and follow heparin levels rather than PTT. Heparin
   level can be ordered stat and takes approximately 4 hours to return.
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr steadily
   downtrending at 2.1 today with continued diuresis. No longer struggling
   with hyperphosphatemia.  High sodium has improved.
   - follow lytes and I/O balance.
   - Discontinued calcium acetate
   - free water flushes at 150cc q4.
   # Constipation:
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relieve constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT of 22.2 on [**2191-4-9**] after steady downtrend during ICU course.
   Thought to be secondary to phlebotomy. Iron studies performed on
   [**2191-4-9**] and ferritin of 346 along with iron sat of 25% not consistent
   with iron deficiency anemia. Received 2 units pRBC
s with good response
   several days ago and is now essentially stable with HCT of 26.5 this
   AM. Per report, patient has history of pernicious anemia. B12 levels
   are WNL as of [**2191-4-11**].
   - Continue to trend
   - plan transfusion if HgB <7
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Balance has now swung that patient has recently been hypertensive. This
   likely either unmasked essential hypertension vs. incomplete sedation.
   Will allow some permissive hypertension in setting of [**Last Name (un) **] in order to
   allow adequate perfusion of kidneys given unknown relative normal [**Name2 (NI) 1056**]
   pressure exposure for kidneys.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia, which has progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) show MRSA infection. The patient has a history of pernicious anemia and completed a steroid taper. She is still requiring sedation but is showing signs of sedation liberation. The plan is to attempt tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on Thursday. The patient also has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is at risk for developing further complications such as pulmonary embolism (PE). She has an elevated PTT and is positive for lupus anticoagulant, which makes monitoring heparin levels necessary for anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation and ARDS, she is at increased risk for developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation and oral care are being implemented to prevent this.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient already has a confirmed DVT and is at risk for developing PE. Anticoagulation therapy needs to be carefully managed due to her positive lupus anticoagulant and low heparin levels.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, ARDS, and is positive for lupus anticoagulant. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy yesterday, which revealed that the endotracheal tube (ETT) was flush against the tracheal wall. The ETT was advanced, and the patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's temperature spiked this morning, and she has been experiencing fluctuating peak pressures likely related to the positioning of the ETT. The patient is on a heparin drip for a transient antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and has an order to get T+G (thrombophilia profile) tomorrow. Cultures have been taken, and no empiric antibiotics are currently being given.

The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased to 21, so she will receive a blood transfusion. Her white blood cell count shows an increase, indicating a possible infection. Other lab results include elevated levels of D-dimer and lactic acid.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.6°C (101.5°F)
- Heart rate: 85 bpm (with normal range of 74-112 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 138/62 mmHg (with normal range of 90/53-150"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. IP
   planning for trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**] if vent settings (FiO2 and
   PEEP) are low enough to allow. Has ongoing diuresis with stable Cr.
   Aside from desaturation last night requiring increase in FiO2 to 70%,
   patient had been doing well at reduced vent settings. During
   bronchoscopy on [**2191-4-19**] was discovered that patient had tip of ET
   tube against tracheal wall. This appeared to contribute to high peak
   inspiratory pressures and thus ET tube was repositioned.
   - weaned well to back to 55%FiO2 in anticipation of trach/peg today.
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Remain off  fentanyl and midazolam drips
   - Heparin/tube feeds off for trach peg today
   - Discontinue furosemide drip and return to bolus furosemide for goal
   of -1L daily
   # Fever:
   Spike to 101.5 this AM is first temperature spike since hospitalized in
   ICU here. Urine, blood, sputum, stool cultures sent. Concern for
   hospital-acquired infection. No evidence of skin breakdown.
   - Follow-up pending cultures.
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. ACA
   antibodies, IgG positive, IgM negative. Heme consulted and given lupus
   anticoagulant positive and low heparin level, patient is likely not
   anticoagulated and PTT cannot be used to follow heparin. Heparin drip
   was begun on [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being
   used to titrate heparin drip.
   - Heparin drip off currently but will need to be titrated to
   unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic 0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and
   takes 4 hours to return) when turned back on after trach/peg
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr stable at
   2.1 today with continued diuresis.
   - follow lytes and I/O balance
   - free water flushes at 150cc q4
   # Constipation:
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relieve constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT slowly downtrending to 21.6 today. Stool is guaiac negative. Likely
   all related to phlebotomy.  Transfused 1unit PRBC on [**4-20**] for slowly
   downward drifting HCT.
   - Minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   Allowing for some permission hypertension for renal perfusion; however,
   will consider tighter control.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure due to MRSA pneumonia, which has progressed into ARDS. The patient's current condition includes fever, desaturation requiring an increase in FiO2 to 70%, and a tip of the ET tube against the tracheal wall contributing to high peak inspiratory pressures. The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, and slightly increased respiratory rate. The patient's lab results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine levels. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged PTT, and the presence of lupus anticoagulant antibodies. The patient has a history of DVT, anemia, constipation, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hospital-acquired infection: The patient's spike in temperature suggests a possible hospital-acquired infection. Cultures have been sent to confirm the diagnosis.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been found to have a left internal jugular vein clot extending into the subclavian vein. The line was removed, but the patient's PTT was elevated without systemic anticoagulation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the elevated PTT.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting a possible acute kidney injury"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. IP
   planning for trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**] if vent settings (FiO2 and
   PEEP) are low enough to allow. Has ongoing diuresis with stable Cr.
   Aside from desaturation last night requiring increase in FiO2 to 70%,
   patient had been doing well at reduced vent settings. During
   bronchoscopy on [**2191-4-19**] was discovered that patient had tip of ET
   tube against tracheal wall. This appeared to contribute to high peak
   inspiratory pressures and thus ET tube was repositioned.
   - weaned well to back to 55%FiO2 in anticipation of trach/peg today.
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Remain off  fentanyl and midazolam drips
   - Heparin/tube feeds off for trach peg today
   - lasix for diuresis, goal net negative 1 litre.
   # Fever:
   Spike to 101.5 this AM is first temperature spike since hospitalized in
   ICU here. Urine, blood, sputum, stool cultures sent. Concern for
   hospital-acquired infection. No evidence of skin breakdown.
   - Follow-up pending cultures, no antibiotics at this time.
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. ACA
   antibodies, IgG positive, IgM negative. Heme consulted and given lupus
   anticoagulant positive and low heparin level, patient is likely not
   anticoagulated and PTT cannot be used to follow heparin. Heparin drip
   was begun on [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being
   used to titrate heparin drip.
   - Heparin drip off currently but will need to be titrated to
   unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic 0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and
   takes 4 hours to return) when turned back on after trach/peg
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr stable at
   2.1 today with continued diuresis.
   - follow lytes and I/O balance, net goal negative.
   - free water flushes at 150cc q4
   # Constipation:  Currently stooling.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relieve constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT slowly downtrending to 21.6 today. Stool is guaiac negative. Likely
   all related to phlebotomy.  Transfused 1unit PRBC on [**4-20**] for slowly
   downward drifting HCT.
   - Minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   Allowing for some permission hypertension for renal perfusion; however,
   will consider tighter control.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia that progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures showed Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The patient has completed a course of Vancomycin and surveillance sputum cultures from previous dates showed rare MRSA growth. 

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 at 55% and PEEP at 5 cmH2O. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 62, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 133, suggesting adequate oxygenation but some respiratory acidosis. 

The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with a clot in the left internal jugular vein extending into the subclavian vein. The central line was removed, but the patient's PTT was initially elevated without systemic anticoagulation. The patient's ANCA test is negative, but the [Doctor First Name] antibody is positive with a titer of 1:80. The patient's HIV status is unknown.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient has been stable overnight but is now febrile. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 148/74 to 129/60 mmHg, heart rate between 90-115 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 300 mL, respiratory rate set at 26, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 55%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels at 2.1 mg/dL, and low albumin levels at 2.5 g/dL. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolytes, and liver enzymes are within normal limits. 

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse crackles bilaterally in the lungs, warm skin, and diminished pulses in both upper extremities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and acute renal failure. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to difficult procedures. They are currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 at 80% and PEEP at 5 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show pH 7.43, PaCO2 59 mmHg, PaO2 52 mmHg, HCO3- 35 mEq/L, and BE -11. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate between 64-115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/62 mmHg to 173/94 mmHg, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is responding to commands but not assessed neurologically. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 612 mL and output of 2480 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1868 mL. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's assessment includes fever, altered mental status, constipation, deep vein thrombosis, alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, ARDS, hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, pneumonia, anxiety, and other conditions. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, arterial and PICC lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for the patient include:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure. Mechanical ventilation may cause ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, which increases the risk of further infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infections, or urinary tract infections.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can worsen kidney function and lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a diagnosis of DVT in the upper extremity, increasing the risk of pulmonary embolism.
5. Constipation: The patient has constipation, which can lead to fecal impaction, discomfort, and potential complications like fecal peritonitis if not managed properly.
6. Nutritional Issues: The patient has alteration in nutrition due to their condition and the need for mechanical ventilation, which may lead to malnutrition and associated complications.
7. Anxiety: The patient has anxiety, which can affect their mental status and overall well-being.
8. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant negative balance, indicating potential fluid overload, which can contribute to respiratory distress and other complications.

It is important to monitor and manage these potential complications closely to ensure the patient's well-being and optimize their recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. IP
   planning for trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**] if vent settings (FiO2 and
   PEEP) are low enough to allow. Has ongoing diuresis with stable Cr.
   Aside from desaturation last night requiring increase in FiO2 to 70%,
   patient had been doing well at reduced vent settings. During
   bronchoscopy on [**2191-4-19**] was discovered that patient had tip of ET
   tube against tracheal wall. This appeared to contribute to high peak
   inspiratory pressures and thus ET tube was repositioned.
   - weaned well to back to 55%FiO2 in anticipation of trach/peg today.
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Remain off  fentanyl and midazolam drips
   - Heparin/tube feeds off for trach peg today
   - lasix for diuresis, goal net negative 1 litre.
   # Fever:
   Spike to 101.5 this AM is first temperature spike since hospitalized in
   ICU here. Urine, blood, sputum, stool cultures sent. Concern for
   hospital-acquired infection. No evidence of skin breakdown.
   - Follow-up pending cultures, no antibiotics at this time.
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to heparin
   SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this admission so
   unlikely to have suddenly developed a deficiency in a clotting factor
   unless poor nutritional status is now contributing. Currently unknown
   if PTT represents anticoagulation vs. hypercoaguable state. ACA
   antibodies, IgG positive, IgM negative. Heme consulted and given lupus
   anticoagulant positive and low heparin level, patient is likely not
   anticoagulated and PTT cannot be used to follow heparin. Heparin drip
   was begun on [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being
   used to titrate heparin drip.
   - Heparin drip off currently but will need to be titrated to
   unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic 0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and
   takes 4 hours to return) when turned back on after trach/peg
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr stable at
   2.1 today with continued diuresis.
   - follow lytes and I/O balance, net goal negative.
   - free water flushes at 150cc q4
   # Constipation:  Currently stooling.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relieve constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT slowly downtrending to 21.6 today. Stool is guaiac negative. Likely
   all related to phlebotomy.  Transfused 1unit PRBC on [**4-20**] for slowly
   downward drifting HCT.
   - Minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   Allowing for some permission hypertension for renal perfusion; however,
   will consider tighter control.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU for pneumonia that has progressed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and has completed a course of Vancomycin. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on [**2191-4-21**]. The patient's condition has been stable with some desaturation requiring an increase in FiO2 to 80%. The patient has ongoing diuresis with improving creatinine levels. The patient's medical history includes fever, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia, and hypertension/hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may lead to further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Hospital-acquired infection: The recent spike in temperature suggests a possible hospital-acquired infection, which could be caused by bacteria such as MRSA or other opportunistic pathogens.
3. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if clot fragments dislodge and travel to the lungs.
4. AKI: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is ongoing diuresis with improving creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. Sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-20**] with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to
   colonization. Received trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**].
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Discontinue aggressive diuresis, goal even
   # Fever:
   Spike to 101.5 on [**4-20**] and was first temperature spike since
   hospitalized in ICU here. Afebrile since. Urine, blood, sputum, stool
   cultures sent. Urine was negative. Blood no growth and pending. Stool
   was c.diff negative. Sputum with MRSA, but thought to be colonization
   at this point.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Is now on hold for heparin drip due to oozing of blood
   around trach site and will be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip to be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**] and will need to
   be titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic 0.3-0.7)
   (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr improving
   to 1.8 today.
   - Trend Cr
   # Constipation:
   Currently stooling.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relieve constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT is 25 today. Stool is guaiac negative. Likely all related to
   phlebotomy.  Transfused 1unit PRBC on [**4-20**] for slowly downward drifting
   HCT and has been stable since.
   - Minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin.
   Received trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**]. Has ongoing diuresis with
   improving Cr. Aside from desaturation last night requiring increase in
   FiO2 to 80%, patient had been doing well. During bronchoscopy on
   [**2191-4-19**] was discovered that patient had tip of ET tube against
   tracheal wall. This appeared to contribute to high peak inspiratory
   pressures and thus ET tube was repositioned.
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - discontinue fentanyl and midazolam drips (these were started at the
   time of the trach and PEG)
   - lasix for diuresis, goal net negative 1 litre.
   # Fever:
   Spike to 101.5 two days age and was first temperature spike since
   hospitalized in ICU here. Urine, blood, sputum, stool cultures sent.
   Concern for hospital-acquired infection. No evidence of skin breakdown.
   - Follow-up pending cultures, no antibiotics at this time.
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however, the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Heme consulted and given lupus anticoagulant positive and
   low heparin level, patient was likely not anticoagulated and PTT cannot
   be used to follow heparin. Heparin drip was begun on [**2191-4-19**] with
   STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate heparin drip.
   - Heparin drip off for the procedure last night but is now restarted
   and will need to be titrated to unfractionated heparin level
   (therapeutic 0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr improving
   again today with continued diuresis.
   - follow lytes and I/O balance, net goal negative.
   - free water flushes at 150cc q4
   # Constipation:  Currently stooling.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relieve constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT slowly downtrended to 21.6. Stool is guaiac negative. Likely all
   related to phlebotomy.  Transfused 1unit PRBC on [**4-20**] for slowly
   downward drifting HCT and has been stable since
   - Minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   Allowing for some permission hypertension for renal perfusion; however,
   will consider tighter control.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of ARDS. She was admitted for pneumonia and later developed ARDS. The patient has been treated with various interventions, including tracheostomy, PEG tube placement, and antibiotic therapy. She has also experienced complications such as hypoxemic respiratory failure, fever, DVT, and acute kidney injury. The patient's current condition includes ongoing diuresis, improving creatinine levels, and desaturation requiring increased FiO2. She is sedated and intubated, with no follow-up commands. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory distress and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.
2. Fever: The spike in temperature indicates a possible infection, and further evaluation is needed to determine the source and appropriate treatment.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed L-IJ clot extending into the subclavian vein. There is a risk of pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated creatinine level and a history of ATN. Continued monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's HCT is decreasing, likely due to phlebotomy. Close monitoring and appropriate management are required to address this issue.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia and ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The patient is sedated and tracheostomized, unable to provide their own medical history.

The patient has been experiencing several complications and conditions. They have oozing around the tracheostomy site, which led to the holding of heparin drip. The patient also has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and has a history of anemia, with previous negative heme results. The patient's mental status is described as not attentive, not following simple commands, and responding inadequately. They are sedated and their neurological assessment is incomplete.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), current temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate between 68-116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/66 mmHg to 168/101 mmHg, respiratory rate between 20-45 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a tracheostomy tube, set respiratory rate of 26, peak inspiratory pressure of 40 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, and tidal volume of 324 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.6 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, platelet count of 160 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 116 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, sodium level of 143 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, chloride level of 100 mEq/L, magnesium level of 29 mg/dL, total bilirubin level of 25.1%, and blood glucose level of 116 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile indicates an elevated D-dimer level of 7914 ng/mL and a normal fibrinogen level of 474 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to pneumonia progressing to ARDS, mental status evaluation with ongoing sedation weaning, anemia management through phlebotomy and rechecking the Guaiac test, fevers with an afebrile episode, left internal jugular vein (IJ) clot with heparin on hold due to bleeding around the tracheostomy site, and acute renal failure with improving creatinine levels. The rest of the plan is mentioned in the resident's note."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. Sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-20**] with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to
   colonization. Received trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**].
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route), will attempt to wean
   methadone today to 30mg IV q4
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - cont diuresis, goal net negative to even
   # Fever:
   Spike to 101.5 on [**4-20**] and was first temperature spike since
   hospitalized in ICU here. Afebrile since. Urine, blood, sputum, stool
   cultures sent. Urine was negative. Blood no growth and pending. Stool
   was c.diff negative. Sputum with MRSA, but thought to be colonization
   at this point.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - If spikes again or has increased secretions, will treat for PNA
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Is now on hold for heparin drip due to oozing of blood
   around trach site and will be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip to be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**] and will need to
   be titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic 0.3-0.7)
   (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr improving
   to 1.7 today.
   - [**Last Name (un) **] Cr
   # Constipation:
   Currently stooling.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relieve constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT is 23.3 today. Stool is guaiac negative. Likely all related to
   phlebotomy.  Transfused 1unit PRBC on [**4-20**] for slowly downward drifting
   HCT and has been stable since.
   - Minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue to [**Last Name (LF) 1940**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold off on transfusion today
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with an admission for pneumonia that has developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She is currently on pressure control ventilation with an FiO2 of 70% and unable to titrate down. The PEEP has been increased from 5 to 8 due to an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing a pO2 of 56 this morning. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and hives. She is receiving infusions of heparin sodium and furosemide (Lasix). Other medications include fentanyl, midazolam, and various ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate of 74 bpm (71-105), blood pressure ranging from 143/63 mmHg to 161/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute (19-36), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,769 mL, with 672 mL given intravenously, 509 mL transfused, and 180 mL given intravenously over the past 24 hours. The total output is 2,690 mL, including 710 mL of urine output, 40 mL of nasogastric output, and 2,650 mL of stool output. The patient's height is 59 inches.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, set at PCV+/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 364 mL (324-364), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 41 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 35 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show pH 7.47, pO2 57, pCO2 38, HCO3- 14 mEq/L, Na+ 141 mEq/L, Cl- 103 mEq/L, K+ 3.4 mEq/L, Ca++ 8.1 mg/dL, and Mg++ 2.1 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is intubated, sedated, and does not follow commands. She has a tracheostomy tube in place. Her cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with regular sinus rhythm, no murmurs, and normal S1 and S2 sounds. Her pulmonary examination shows coarse breath sounds bilaterally anteriorly. Her abdominal examination is soft, non-distended, and not tympanic. Decreased bowel sounds are noted. She has superficial ecchymoses and a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG"

The patient is a 59-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 143/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in pressure control mode with a tidal volume of 364 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 56 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications and is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium and fentanyl. The patient also has a tracheostomy tube in place, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, and peripheral intravenous catheters. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 24.1 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 38 mg/dL, elevated creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, elevated lactate of 27 mg/dL, hypokalemia with potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, hyponatremia with sodium level of 117 mEq/L, elevated glucose of 131 mg/dL, and elevated D-dimer level of 7914 ng/mL. Other lab results show normal platelet count, hemoglobin, and liver function tests.

The patient's medical history includes hemorrhage, fever, altered mental status, constipation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia, and anxiety. The patient has been receiving nutrition via enteral feeding and has arterial and peripheral intravenous lines in place for monitoring and medication administration. Prophylactic measures have been taken for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's prolonged intubation and immobility increase the risk of developing pneumonia.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility, central venous catheters, and elevated D-dimer levels suggest an increased risk of developing DVT.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation, high FiO2 requirement"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. Sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-20**] with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to
   colonization. Received trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**].
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Discontinue aggressive diuresis, goal even
   # Fever:
   Spike to 101.5 on [**4-20**] and was first temperature spike since
   hospitalized in ICU here. Afebrile since. Urine, blood, sputum, stool
   cultures sent. Urine was negative. Blood no growth and pending. Stool
   was c.diff negative. Sputum with MRSA, but thought to be colonization
   at this point.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Is now on hold for heparin drip due to oozing of blood
   around trach site and will be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip to be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**] and will need to
   be titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic 0.3-0.7)
   (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr improving
   to 1.7 today.
   - Trend Cr
   # Constipation:
   Currently stooling.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relieve constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT is 25 today. Stool is guaiac negative. Likely all related to
   phlebotomy.  Transfused 1unit PRBC on [**4-20**] for slowly downward drifting
   HCT and has been stable since.
   - Minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by ARDS. There is also evidence of MRSA pneumonia, which has been treated with Vancomycin.

2. DVT: The patient has a left internal jugular vein (IJ) clot extending into the subclavian vein. The line has been removed, and the patient's PTT was initially elevated without systemic anticoagulation. A positive lupus anticoagulant was found, and the patient's heparin drip was started but temporarily held due to oozing around the tracheostomy site. It will be restarted on the morning of [**2191-4-24**].

3. Fever: The patient experienced a spike in temperature on [**4-20**] but has been afebrile since then. Urine culture was negative, blood culture is pending, and stool culture was c.diff negative. Sputum culture showed MRSA, but it is thought to be colonization at this point.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level (HCT 25) likely related to phlebotomy. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) on [**4-20**] and has been stable since then.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. Sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-20**] with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to
   colonization. Received trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**]. Was moved to
   pressure support ventilation on [**2191-4-24**] and doing well so far aside
   from one desat this AM requiring FiO2 increase to 100% temporarily.
   - Follow-up ABG after decreasing FiO2 back to 70% this AM
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route), methadone was titrated
   down to 30 mg Q4H yesterday, will hold off on further titration today
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Relax diuresis and goal of even today
   # Fever:
   Spike again last night. Blood and urine cultures negative thus far and
   remain negative from spike on [**2191-4-20**].
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Follow-up urine culture
   # Anemia:
   HCT down to 22 today. Has slowly trended down. Stool has been guaiac
   negative; however, has not been rechecked since starting heparin drip.
   - Guaiac stool
   - Evening HCT check
   - Transfusion threshold of < 21 for HCT
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Is now on hold for heparin drip due to oozing of blood
   around trach site and will be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic
   0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been stable, but she has experienced some complications, including fever, anemia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and possible transient positive lupus anticoagulant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to severe respiratory distress and potentially require prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Fever: The patient has had multiple episodes of fever, which could indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying condition. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels have been trending down, indicating a decrease in red blood cell count. This could be due to phlebotomy, ongoing bleeding, or other factors. Monitoring and managing the patient's blood loss is important to prevent worsening anemia.
4. DVT: The patient was found to have a left internal jugular vein clot extending into the subclavian vein. The line was removed, but the patient's PTT was elevated initially without systemic anticoagulation. A positive lupus anticoagulant was found, and it is believed that the PTT elevation may be unreliable in determining the patient's anticoagulation status. The patient is"

   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. Sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-20**] with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to
   colonization. Received trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**]. Was moved to
   pressure support ventilation on [**2191-4-24**] and doing well so far aside
   from one desat this AM requiring FiO2 increase to 100% temporarily.
   - Follow-up ABG after decreasing FiO2 back to 70% this AM
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route), methadone was titrated
   down to 30 mg Q4H yesterday, will hold off on further titration today
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Relax diuresis and goal of even today
   # Fever:
   Spike again last night. Blood and urine cultures negative thus far and
   remain negative from spike on [**2191-4-20**].
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Follow-up urine culture
   # Anemia:
   HCT down to 22 today. Has slowly trended down. Stool has been guaiac
   negative; however, has not been rechecked since starting heparin drip.
   - Guaiac stool
   - Evening HCT check
   - Transfusion threshold of < 21 for HCT
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Is now on hold for heparin drip due to oozing of blood
   around trach site and will be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic
   0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks

   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Cr appears to be fixed at

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia that developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been colonized with Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and has completed a course of Vancomycin. The patient has been intubated, sedated, and placed on mechanical ventilation. She received a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube on [2191-4-21]. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/67 to 118/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's sedation was decreased, and she became more alert, leading to a switch to pressure support ventilation. The patient has been receiving heparin sodium infusion and various medications such as pantoprazole, furosemide, fentanyl, and midazolam. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and elevated D-dimer level. Urinalysis and urine culture are negative. The patient's blood culture is pending. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, anemia, fever, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and possible renal dysfunction. The patient's anticoagulation status"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient in the ICU is experiencing decreased sedation, increased alertness, and blinking eyes to command after a decrease in methadone dosage. The patient also has a fever of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, tachycardia, and hypertension. Blood and urine cultures were obtained. The patient is known to be a colonizer of MRSA, so a repeat sputum culture was not done. Due to the patient's sedation, a complete review of systems (ROS) could not be obtained. The patient has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and receives various infusions, including heparin sodium, pantoprazole, furosemide, fentanyl, and midazolam.

Flow Sheet Data:
Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius (101.1 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate ranging from 74 to 122 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 118/57 to 178/99 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 16 to 64 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's height is 59 inches, and there is a fluid balance of -670 mL since midnight.

Respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, spontaneous tidal"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a recent decrease in sedation and an increase in alertness. They have been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypertension, with blood and urine cultures taken. The patient is intubated, sedated, and not following commands. They have a tracheostomy tube in place and are on pressure support ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 74 to 122 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 118/57 to 178/99 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 16 to 64 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%.

The patient has received various medications, including methadone, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, furosemide, fentanyl, and midazolam. They have also had several lab tests done, which show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but slightly elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactic acid.

The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 374 mL, pressure support of 22 cmH2O, set respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 70%, and an ABG result of pH 7.46, PaCO2 61 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 221, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 8 L/min.

The physical examination reveals an intubated patient with coarse breath sounds bilaterally, decreased bowel sounds, a PEG tube in place, and superficial ecchymoses. The patient is sedated and non-responsive but withdraws to painful stimuli.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and infections due to the presence of a tracheostomy tube and PEG tube. The patient's elevated temperature and abnormal white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, which could be related to VAP or another source. The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged PT and PTT, which may suggest a bleeding tendency or coagulopathy.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, temperature, and laboratory values to identify any potential complications early on and initiate appropriate interventions."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. Sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-20**] with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to
   colonization. Received trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**].
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route), will attempt to wean
   methadone today to 30mg IV q4
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - cont diuresis, goal net negative to even
   # Fever:
   Spike to 101.5 on [**4-20**] and was first temperature spike since
   hospitalized in ICU here. Afebrile since. Urine, blood, sputum, stool
   cultures sent. Urine was negative. Blood no growth and pending. Stool
   was c.diff negative. Sputum with MRSA, but thought to be colonization
   at this point.
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - If spikes again or has increased secretions, will treat for PNA
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Is now on hold for heparin drip due to oozing of blood
   around trach site and will be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip to be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**] and will need to
   be titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic 0.3-0.7)
   (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Resolving with Cr improving
   to 1.7 today.
   - [**Last Name (un) **] Cr
   # Constipation:
   Currently stooling.
   - Continue lactulose PO and PR as needed
   - If lactulose fails, could consider PO narcan to relieve constipation
   #Anemia:
   HCT is 23.3 today. Stool is guaiac negative. Likely all related to
   phlebotomy.  Transfused 1unit PRBC on [**4-20**] for slowly downward drifting
   HCT and has been stable since.
   - Minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue to [**Last Name (LF) 1940**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold off on transfusion today
   # Hypotension/Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia that developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been complicated by MRSA infection, fever, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and possible transient positive lupus anticoagulant. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, sedation management, diuretics, and anticoagulation therapy. The patient's vital signs have been stable, with some fluctuations in blood pressure. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, and D-dimer levels. Imaging studies have shown no growth in sputum culture, and the patient's creatinine level has improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia.
2. MRSA infection: The presence of MRSA in sputum cultures indicates a risk of further infection and potential resistance to antibiotics.
3. Fever: The spike in temperature suggests a possible infection or inflammatory response, requiring further investigation and management.
4. DVT: The patient has been diagnosed with a left iliac vein thrombosis extending into the subclavian vein, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.
5. Lupus anticoagulant: The positive lupus anticoagulant result may affect the reliability of PTT in determining anticoagulation status.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. Sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-20**] with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to
   colonization initially; however, has been persistently febrile.
   Received trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**]. Was moved to pressure support
   ventilation on [**2191-4-24**] and now with increasing vent requirements and
   need for increasing pressure and PEEP to maintain sats. CXR appears
   worse today and in setting of new fevers, concern for VAP.
   - Initiate empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL today
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Diuresis with goal of even today
   # Fever:
   Febrile in last several days. Blood and urine cultures negative thus
   far and remain negative from spike on [**2191-4-20**]. CXR appears much worse
   today than prior.
   - Initiate empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL today
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   - Follow-up urine culture
   # Anemia:
   HCT stable at 22 today. Has slowly trended down. Stool is guaiac
   negative.
   - Transfusion threshold of < 21 for HCT
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Is now on hold for heparin drip due to oozing of blood
   around trach site and will be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic
   0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Cr appears to be fixed at
   ~1.8 at this time. Nephrology was consulted initially, but has signed
   off.
   - Relax on diuresis to see if Cr will further recover.
   - [**Last Name (un) **] Cr
   # Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Cont Diltiazem 60 mg four times daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia that developed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She has been experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on pressure support ventilation due to increasing ventilatory requirements. The patient has been persistently febrile, and there is concern for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). She has received tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. There are indications of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as evidenced by low fibrinogen level and elevated D-dimer. The patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is being managed with enoxaparin. She has anemia with a hematocrit (HCT) level of 22. The patient's renal function is impaired, and she has a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL. Her blood and urine cultures are negative so far. She is being treated with linezolid, Zosyn, and ciprofloxacin empirically for suspected VAP. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, labetalol, fentanyl, midazolam, and sliding scale insulin."

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. Sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-20**] with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to
   colonization. Received trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**]. Was moved to
   pressure support ventilation on [**2191-4-24**] and doing well so far aside
   from one desat this AM requiring FiO2 increase to 100% temporarily.
   - Follow-up ABG after decreasing FiO2 back to 70% this AM
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route), methadone was titrated
   down to 30 mg Q4H yesterday, will hold off on further titration today
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Relax diuresis and goal of even today
   # Fever:
   Spike again last night. Blood and urine cultures negative thus far and
   remain negative from spike on [**2191-4-20**].
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures.
   - Follow-up urine culture
   # Anemia:
   HCT down to 22 today. Has slowly trended down. Stool has been guaiac
   negative; however, has not been rechecked since starting heparin drip.
   - Guaiac stool
   - Evening HCT check
   - Transfusion threshold of < 21 for HCT
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Is now on hold for heparin drip due to oozing of blood
   around trach site and will be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic
   0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Cr appears to be fixed at
   ~1.8 at this time. Nephrology was consulted initially, but has signed
   off.
   - Relax on diuresis to see if Cr will further recover.
   - [**Last Name (un) **] Cr
   #Anemia:
   HCT is 23.3 today. Stool is guaiac negative. Likely all related to
   phlebotomy.  Transfused 1unit PRBC on [**4-20**] for slowly downward drifting
   HCT and has been stable since.
   - Minimize phlebotomy
   - Continue to [**Last Name (LF) 1940**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hold off on transfusion today
   # Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Cont diltiazem to 60mg qid

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia that developed into ARDS. She has been on pressure support ventilation and has shown improvement. The patient has completed a course of Vancomycin and is now colonized with MRSA. Her vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, increased heart rate, and normal blood pressure. She is receiving various infusions including Heparin sodium, Labetalol, Fentanyl, and Midazolam. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Her lab results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated D-dimer levels. She has a history of DVT and is currently on heparin drip. The patient's renal function is compromised, and she has been diagnosed with transient positive lupus anticoagulant. The plan is to continue weaning off sedation, maintaining blood glucose control, and monitoring for any complications such as fever, anemia, and hypertension. The patient will remain in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. MRSA infection: The patient has been colonized with MRSA. Infection control measures should be implemented to prevent the spread of MRSA.
3. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a history of septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and acute renal failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple antibiotics for the suspected bacterial infection. Her recent events include worsening hypoxia, new fevers, and increased secretions. She has been started on linezolid, Zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. Blood cultures have returned positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters. A mini-BAL was performed, and new blood cultures were drawn for surveillance. The patient's sister was informed about the new infection. The patient experienced difficulty ventilating and required volume control ventilation with an ABG showing respiratory acidosis. She was switched to pressure control ventilation with FiO2 increased to 100% and ABG redrawn showing improvement. Her hematocrit level decreased to 21.3, so she received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Urine electrolytes were sent due to low urine output and slight increase/plateau in creatinine. Fever of 101.5 degrees was recorded. The patient has allergies to sulfa medications and has been receiving infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin sodium. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 139/66 mmH"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation has been liberated and patient now doing well on bolus
   fentanyl and midazolam. Surveillance sputum culture from [**2191-4-8**] and
   [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth. Completed course of Vancomycin. Sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-20**] with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to
   colonization initially; however, has been persistently febrile.
   Received trach and PEG on [**2191-4-21**]. Was moved to pressure support
   ventilation on [**2191-4-24**] and now with increasing vent requirements and
   need for increasing pressure and PEEP to maintain sats. CXR appears
   worse today and in setting of new fevers, concern for VAP.
   - Initiate empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL today
   - Continue fentanyl patch at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Diuresis with goal of even today
   # Fever:
   Febrile in last several days. Blood and urine cultures negative thus
   far and remain negative from spike on [**2191-4-20**]. CXR appears much worse
   today than prior.
   - Initiate empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL today
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   - Follow-up urine culture
   # Anemia:
   HCT stable at 22 today. Has slowly trended down. Stool is guaiac
   negative.
   - Transfusion threshold of < 21 for HCT
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Is now on hold for heparin drip due to oozing of blood
   around trach site and will be restarted on morning of [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic
   0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Cr appears to be fixed at
   ~1.8 at this time. Nephrology was consulted initially, but has signed
   off.
   - Relax on diuresis to see if Cr will further recover.
   - Trend Cr
   # Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Cont Diltiazem 60 mg four times daily

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old female with an admission for pneumonia that has progressed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures have shown methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The patient has completed a course of vancomycin, but remains persistently febrile. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to her increasing respiratory requirements.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 139/66 mmHg to 199/113 mmHg, heart rate between 84-115 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's neurological status is described as sedated and non-responsive.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.8-10.9 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin level of 7.1-7.3 g/dL, platelet count of 281,000/mm³, blood urea nitrogen level of 25-35 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.8-1.9 mg/dL, and sodium level of 135-140 mEq/L.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to ARDS and MRSA pneumonia, anemia with a hemoglobin level below"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 59-year-old female admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and sepsis. She is currently intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing fevers, increased secretions, worsening chest X-ray, and worsening hypoxia. She was started on linezolid, Zosyn, and ciprofloxacin due to new fevers, increased secretions, worsening CXR, and worsening hypoxia. One of her blood cultures returned positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters. Mini-BAL was performed, and new blood cultures were drawn for surveillance.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 139/66-199/113 mmHg, heart rate between 84-115 bpm, respiratory rate of 22-57 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on 100% FiO2. Her ABG shows pH 7.36, PaCO2 69 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 53. The patient has a Hct of 21.3% and received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. She also has low urine output and an increasing creatinine level, so urine electrolytes were sent.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for new symptoms. Her physical examination shows coarse breath"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation had been weaned, however the patient is now again requiring
   drip plus bolus sedation (fentanyl and midazolam). Surveillance sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth and the
   patient completed a course of Vancomycin. Sputum culture from [**2191-4-20**]
   with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to colonization initially;
   however, has been persistently febrile. Received trach and PEG on
   [**2191-4-21**]. Was moved to pressure support ventilation on [**2191-4-24**] and
   now with increasing vent requirements and need for increasing pressure
   and PEEP to maintain sats. CXR appears worse and in setting of new
   fevers and now with blood culture from [**4-25**] and gram stain from [**4-26**]
   mini-BAL with gram positive cocci. Continuing Linezolid, Vanc and
   Ciprofloxacin for now. Now on pressure control with FiO2 of 100%.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - f/u Mini-BAL culture
   - Continue fenatnyl and midazolam drips as needed, cont fentanyl patch
   at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Diuresis with goal of -1L today
   - follow-up speciation, sensitivities, and also surveillance cultures
   - wean FiO2
   - will need family meeting to discuss worsening condition
   # Fever:
   Febrile in last several days. Blood and mini-BAL cultures indicating
   new infection. CXR appears worse.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL yesterday showing increased gram +ve cocci
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   - Follow-up urine culture
   # Anemia:
   HCT slightly down at 21.3 today. Has slowly trended down. Stool is
   guaiac negative.
   - Transfusion one unit pRBCs
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Drip was on hold briefly after trach procedure due to
   oozing of blood around trach site and was restarted on morning of
   [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic
   0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Cr appears to be fixed at
   ~1.8-1.9 at this time. Nephrology was consulted initially, but has
   signed off. Urine lytes sent due to low urine output. Fract Urea 60%
   which is consistent with ATN (50-65%).
   - Relax on diuresis to see if Cr will further recover.
   - Trend Cr
   # Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Cont Diltiazem 60 mg four times daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia developing into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She has been admitted to the ICU for treatment. The patient's condition has been worsening, with new fevers, increased secretions, and a worsening chest X-ray. Blood cultures have shown positive results for gram-positive cocci, indicating a new infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with increased requirements for pressure and PEEP to maintain oxygen saturation levels. She is also experiencing anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.1 g/dL. A lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was found, and the patient is receiving heparin therapy. Renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL, and the patient has been receiving diuretics. The patient's hypertension is being managed with diltiazem. Nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's worsening condition, including new fevers and increased secretions, along with the positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci, suggest a possible VAP. Empiric coverage for VAP has been initiated with Linezolid, Zosyn, and Ciprofloxacin.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output indicate possible AK"

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation had been weaned, however the patient is now again requiring
   drip plus bolus sedation (fentanyl and midazolam). Surveillance sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth and the
   patient completed a course of Vancomycin. Sputum culture from [**2191-4-20**]
   with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to colonization initially;
   however, has been persistently febrile. Received trach and PEG on
   [**2191-4-21**]. Was moved to pressure support ventilation on [**2191-4-24**] and
   now with increasing vent requirements and need for increasing pressure
   and PEEP to maintain sats. CXR appears worse and in setting of new
   fevers and now with blood culture from [**4-25**] and gram stain from [**4-26**]
   mini-BAL with gram positive cocci. Continuing Linezolid, Vanc and
   Ciprofloxacin for now. Now on pressure control with FiO2 of 100%.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL today
   - Continue fenatnyl and midazolam drips as needed, cont fentanyl patch
   at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Diuresis with goal of even to -1L today
   - follow-up speciation, sensitivities, and also surveillance cultures
   - will need family meeting to discuss worsening condition
   # Fever:
   Febrile in last several days. Blood and mini-BAL cultures indicating
   new infection. CXR appears worse.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL yesterday showing increased gram +ve cocci
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   - Follow-up urine culture
   # Anemia:
   HCT slightly down at 21.3 today. Has slowly trended down. Stool is
   guaiac negative.
   - Transfusion one unit pRBCs
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Drip was on hold briefly after trach procedure due to
   oozing of blood around trach site and was restarted on morning of
   [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic
   0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Cr appears to be fixed at
   ~1.8-1.9 at this time. Nephrology was consulted initially, but has
   signed off. Urine lytes sent due to low urine output. Fract Urea 60%
   which is consistent with ATN (50-65%).
   - Relax on diuresis to see if Cr will further recover.
   - Trend Cr
   # Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Cont Diltiazem 60 mg four times daily

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia that has progressed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures indicate MRSA infection. The patient has been febrile for several days, and the chest X-ray appears worse. She has been started on Linezolid, Zosyn, and Ciprofloxacin empiric coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and a mini-BAL was performed. The patient requires increasing ventilatory support, and her saturation levels are low. She has anemia with a hematocrit level of 21.3% and has received a blood transfusion. The patient also has a left iliac vein thrombus extending into the subclavian vein, for which the line was removed. She has an elevated PTT initially, but it is thought to be unreliable due to a transient positive lupus anticoagulant. Heparin drip has been initiated, and enoxaparin will be managed once renal function allows. The patient's creatinine levels are stable at around 1.8-1.9, and she has a history of possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Her blood pressure is stable with systolics in the 120s to 150s when sedation is managed."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with MRSA pneumonia and ARDS. She has been worsening, requiring more oxygen and experiencing fevers. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfa medications, and her last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and linezolid. She is currently on infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 142/68 to 199/113 mmHg, heart rate between 84 and 115 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems and flow sheet data are unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's physical examination reveals coarse crackles in the chest, warm skin, and unresponsive neurologic status. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, D-dimer, and LDH levels, along with low potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 69, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 53, and oxygen consumption. The patient's chest X-ray shows fibrotic changes consistent with ARDS.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation had been weaned, however the patient is now again requiring
   drip plus bolus sedation (fentanyl and midazolam). Surveillance sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth and the
   patient completed a course of Vancomycin. Sputum culture from [**2191-4-20**]
   with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to colonization initially;
   however, has been persistently febrile. Received trach and PEG on
   [**2191-4-21**]. Was moved to pressure support ventilation on [**2191-4-24**] and
   now with increasing vent requirements and need for increasing pressure
   and PEEP to maintain sats. CXR appears worse and in setting of new
   fevers. Blood cultures from [**4-25**] show coag neg staph and gram stain
   from [**4-26**] mini-BAL with coag positive staph aureus. Continuing
   Linezolid, Vanc and Ciprofloxacin for now. Respiratory status worsening
   on pressure control with FiO2 of 100%, recruitment attempts without
   effect.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL culture shows coag positive staph aureus (10-100,000)
   - Continue fenatnyl and midazolam drips as needed, cont fentanyl patch
   at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Diuresis
   - follow-up speciation, sensitivities, and also surveillance cultures
   - wean FiO2
   - will need family meeting to discuss worsening condition
   # Fever:
   Febrile in last several days. Blood and mini-BAL cultures indicating
   new infection. CXR appears worse.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL yesterday showing increased gram +ve cocci
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   - Follow-up urine culture
   # Anemia:
   HCT to 24 from 21.3 yesterday after one unit pRBCs. Stool is guaiac
   negative.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Transfuse as necessary
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Drip was on hold briefly after trach procedure due to
   oozing of blood around trach site and was restarted on morning of
   [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic
   0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Cr appears to be fixed at
   ~1.8-1.9 at this time. Nephrology was consulted initially, but has
   signed off. Urine lytes sent due to low urine output. Fract Urea 60%
   which is consistent with ATN (50-65%).  Overnight urine output trending
   down despite lasix gtt and diuril.
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Continue Diuril 500 mg IV BID
   # Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Cont Diltiazem 60 mg four times daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of pneumonia, which has progressed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is worsening, with increasing ventilator requirements and the need for higher pressures and PEEP to maintain oxygen saturation levels. She has developed a new infection, indicated by persistent fever and blood cultures showing coag-negative staph and later coag-positive staph aureus. The patient has been treated with Linezolid, Vancomycin, and Ciprofloxacin. She also has anemia, with a hematocrit of 24, and received one unit of packed red blood cells. The patient has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left internal jugular vein, extending into the subclavian vein. Initially, there was an elevated PTT without systemic anticoagulation, but it is now believed to be unreliable due to a transient positive lupus anticoagulant. Heparin drip was initiated, and enoxaparin will be used once renal function allows. The patient's kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of approximately 1.8-1.9, and nephrology has signed off. Urine output is low, and diuretics have been used without significant improvement. The patient's hypertension is stable on Diltiazem. Nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS is not improving, and there is worsening hypoxemia despite maximum ventilator support.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed a new infection, likely VAP, indicated by persistent fever and positive cultures for coag-negative staph and coag-positive staph aureus.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is low at 24, indicating anemia. She received one unit of packed red blood cells, but her anemia may continue to be a concern.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed DVT in the left internal jugular vein, which extends into the subclavian vein. Anticoagulation is being managed with heparin drip, and enoxaparin will be used once renal function allows.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. Low urine output persists despite diuretic use.
6. Hypertension: The patient's systolic blood pressure is in the 150s when sedation is managed. Diltiazem is being used for blood pressure control.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation had been weaned, however the patient is now again requiring
   drip plus bolus sedation (fentanyl and midazolam). Surveillance sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth and the
   patient completed a course of Vancomycin. Sputum culture from [**2191-4-20**]
   with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to colonization initially;
   however, has been persistently febrile. Received trach and PEG on
   [**2191-4-21**]. Was moved to pressure support ventilation on [**2191-4-24**] and
   now with increasing vent requirements and need for increasing pressure
   and PEEP to maintain sats. CXR appears worse and in setting of new
   fevers. Blood cultures from [**4-25**] show coag neg staph and gram stain
   from [**4-26**] mini-BAL with coag positive staph aureus. Continuing
   Linezolid, Vanc and Ciprofloxacin for now. Respiratory status worsening
   on pressure control with FiO2 of 100%, recruitment attempts without
   effect.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL culture shows coag positive staph aureus (10-100,000)
   - Continue fenatnyl and midazolam drips as needed, cont fentanyl patch
   at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Diuresis with goal of -1L today
   - follow-up speciation, sensitivities, and also surveillance cultures
   - wean FiO2
   - will need family meeting to discuss worsening condition
   # Fever:
   Febrile in last several days. Blood and mini-BAL cultures indicating
   new infection. CXR appears worse.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL yesterday showing increased gram +ve cocci
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   - Follow-up urine culture
   # Anemia:
   HCT to 24 from 21.3 yesterday after one unit pRBCs. Stool is guaiac
   negative.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Transfuse as necessary
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Drip was on hold briefly after trach procedure due to
   oozing of blood around trach site and was restarted on morning of
   [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic
   0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Cr appears to be fixed at
   ~1.8-1.9 at this time. Nephrology was consulted initially, but has
   signed off. Urine lytes sent due to low urine output. Fract Urea 60%
   which is consistent with ATN (50-65%).  Overnight urine output trending
   down despite lasix gtt and diuril.
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Continue Diuril 500 mg IV BID
   # Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Cont Diltiazem 60 mg four times daily

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing worsening respiratory status with increasing ventilator requirements and need for higher levels of FiO2. This suggests a progressive decline in oxygenation.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has persistent fever, worsening chest x-ray, and positive blood cultures for coagulase-negative staphylococcus and coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus. These findings indicate a possible VAP infection.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed left internal jugular vein DVT extending into the subclavian vein. The elevated PTT initially was thought to be due to heparin, but further evaluation revealed a transient positive lupus anticoagulant. As a result, the reliability of PTT for determining anticoagulation status is questionable.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level appears to be fixed at ~1.8-1.9, suggesting a possible ATN (acute tubular necrosis). The nephrology consultation has signed off, and the patient's urine output is trending down despite diuretic therapy.

5. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure is currently stable, it has been managed with antihypertensive medication (dilt"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to MRSA pneumonia. She has developed ARDS and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of pneumonia, which was initially treated with vancomycin. However, she has persistently been febrile, and recent cultures have shown gram-positive cocci in her blood and mini-BAL. The patient is currently on empiric coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with linezolid, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin. Her respiratory status is worsening despite high FiO2, and she has decreased urine output with evidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She also has anemia with a HCT of 24 from 21.3 after receiving one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient was found to have a left iliac vein (L-IJ) clot extending into the subclavian vein, and her activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was elevated initially without systemic anticoagulation. She has a positive lupus anticoagulant, and her heparin drip was restarted on [**2191-4-24**]. The patient's blood cultures from [**2191-4-25**] and gram stain from [**2191-4-26**] mini-BAL showed gram-positive cocci.

   Assessment and Plan
   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation had been weaned, however the patient is now again requiring
   drip plus bolus sedation (fentanyl and midazolam). Surveillance sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth and the
   patient completed a course of Vancomycin. Sputum culture from [**2191-4-20**]
   with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to colonization initially;
   however, has been persistently febrile. Received trach and PEG on
   [**2191-4-21**]. Was moved to pressure support ventilation on [**2191-4-24**] and
   now with increasing vent requirements and need for increasing pressure
   and PEEP to maintain sats. CXR appears worse and in setting of new
   fevers and now with blood culture from [**4-25**] and gram stain from [**4-26**]
   mini-BAL with gram positive cocci. Continuing Linezolid, Vanc and
   Ciprofloxacin for now. Now on pressure control with FiO2 of 100%.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - f/u Mini-BAL culture
   - Continue fenatnyl and midazolam drips as needed, cont fentanyl patch
   at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Diuresis with goal of -1L today
   - follow-up speciation, sensitivities, and also surveillance cultures
   - wean FiO2
   - will need family meeting to discuss worsening condition
   # Fever:
   Febrile in last several days. Blood and mini-BAL cultures indicating
   new infection. CXR appears worse.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL yesterday showing increased gram +ve cocci
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   - Follow-up urine culture
   # Anemia:
   HCT slightly down at 21.3 today. Has slowly trended down. Stool is
   guaiac negative.
   - Transfusion one unit pRBCs
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Drip was on hold briefly after trach procedure due to
   oozing of blood around trach site and was restarted on morning of
   [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic
   0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Cr appears to be fixed at
   ~1.8-1.9 at this time. Nephrology was consulted initially, but has
   signed off. Urine lytes sent due to low urine output. Fract Urea 60%
   which is consistent with ATN (50-65%).
   - Relax on diuresis to see if Cr will further recover.
   - Trend Cr
   # Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Cont Diltiazem 60 mg four times daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was admitted for pneumonia that progressed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures showed MRSA, and she has completed a course of Vancomycin. However, she remains persistently febrile, and recent blood and mini-BAL cultures indicate a new infection. The chest X-ray appears worse, indicating a worsening condition.

The patient is currently on pressure control ventilation with FiO2 of 100% and receiving empiric coverage for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) with Linezolid, Zosyn, and Ciprofloxacin. She also has a history of anemia, with a hemoglobin concentration of 7.8 g/dL, and has received a blood transfusion.

Additionally, the patient was found to have a left iliac vein-to-jugular vein clot extending into the subclavian vein. The arterial line was removed, and she developed a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which was initially attributed to heparin therapy. However, further evaluation revealed a positive lupus anticoagulant, and it is believed that the PTT elevation is unreliable in determining the patient's anticoagulation status. The patient is currently managed with unfractionated heparin"

   62F with admission for pneumonia developing into ARDS. Sputum and BAL
   showing MRSA at this point.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   ARDS in the setting of MRSA pneumonia. Possibility of other
   complicating factors; however, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] positive with titer
   only 1:80, HIV status unknown. Has completed steroid taper. Drip
   sedation had been weaned, however the patient is now again requiring
   drip plus bolus sedation (fentanyl and midazolam). Surveillance sputum
   culture from [**2191-4-8**] and [**2191-4-10**] with rare MRSA growth and the
   patient completed a course of Vancomycin. Sputum culture from [**2191-4-20**]
   with sparse MRSA, thought to be related to colonization initially;
   however, has been persistently febrile. Received trach and PEG on
   [**2191-4-21**]. Was moved to pressure support ventilation on [**2191-4-24**] and
   now with increasing vent requirements and need for increasing pressure
   and PEEP to maintain sats. CXR appears worse and in setting of new
   fevers and now with blood culture from [**4-25**] and gram stain from [**4-26**]
   mini-BAL with gram positive cocci. Continuing Linezolid, Vanc and
   Ciprofloxacin for now. Now on pressure control with FiO2 of 100%.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - f/u Mini-BAL culture
   - Continue fenatnyl and midazolam drips as needed, cont fentanyl patch
   at 200mcg/hr
   - Continue methadone and diazepam (PO route)
   - Bolus fentanyl and midazolam as needed
   - Diuresis with goal of -1L today
   - follow-up speciation, sensitivities, and also surveillance cultures
   - wean FiO2
   - will need family meeting to discuss worsening condition
   # Fever:
   Febrile in last several days. Blood and mini-BAL cultures indicating
   new infection. CXR appears worse.
   - Cont empiric VAP coverage with Linezolid, Zosyn, Ciprofloxacin
   - Mini-BAL yesterday showing increased gram +ve cocci
   - Follow-up pending blood cultures
   - Follow-up urine culture
   # Anemia:
   HCT slightly down at 21.3 today. Has slowly trended down. Stool is
   guaiac negative.
   - Transfusion one unit pRBCs
   # DVT:
   Found to have L-IJ clot extending into subclavian. The line was removed
   however; the patient
s PTT was elevated initially without systemic
   anticoagulation.  Initially unclear if this rise in PTT is due only to
   heparin SC, however patient had previously normal PTT on this
   admission. Lupus anticoag was found to be positive and Heme consult was
   obtained and feels that patient has a transient positive lupus
   anticoagulant. Any PTT elevation is thought to be unreliable in
   determining patient
s anti-coag status. Heparin drip was begun on
   [**2191-4-19**] with STAT unfractionated heparin levels being used to titrate
   heparin drip. Drip was on hold briefly after trach procedure due to
   oozing of blood around trach site and was restarted on morning of
   [**2191-4-24**].
   - Heparin drip titrated to unfractionated heparin level (therapeutic
   0.3-0.7) (ordered STAT and takes 4 hours to return)
   - Will manage anticoagulation with enoxaparin once renal function
   allows
   - Patient should have repeat LUE ultrasound as well as lupus
   anticoagulant (LA) in one month and if LA remains positive will need
   recheck in 12 weeks
   # [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Thought to originally be attributed to ATN. Cr appears to be fixed at
   ~1.8-1.9 at this time. Nephrology was consulted initially, but has
   signed off. Urine lytes sent due to low urine output. Fract Urea 60%
   which is consistent with ATN (50-65%).
   - Relax on diuresis to see if Cr will further recover.
   - Trend Cr
   # Hypertension:
   Currently stable with systolics in 120s
 150s when sedation managed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia that has progressed into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures have shown Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The patient has completed a course of Vancomycin, but remains persistently febrile. She has been intubated and placed on pressure support ventilation due to increasing ventilatory requirements. The chest X-ray appears worse, and new fevers have developed along with blood culture from 4/25 and gram-positive cocci seen on gram stain from 4/26 mini-BAL. The patient is currently receiving empiric coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Linezolid, Zosyn, and Ciprofloxacin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS has worsened, leading to significant hypoxemia despite being on 100% FiO2. There is a possibility of other complicating factors, with ANCA negative and [**Doctor First Name **] positive but with a low titer of 1:80. The patient's HIV status is unknown, and she has completed a steroid taper.

2. Fever: The patient has been febrile for several days, and blood and mini-BAL cultures indicate a new infection. The chest X-ray shows worsening, indicating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted for pneumonia that has progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She has been diagnosed with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with worsening hypoxemia, increased ventilatory requirements, and new fevers. Recent mini-balloon aspiration (mini-BAL) showed gram-positive cocci, indicating a new infection. The patient is currently on pressure control ventilation with 100% FiO2. Empiric coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is being provided with Linezolid, Zosyn, and Ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS has worsened, leading to severe hypoxemia. Continuous support with high levels of FiO2 is necessary.
2. Infection: There is evidence of a new infection, as indicated by the fevers and positive blood and mini-BAL cultures showing gram-positive cocci. This could be due to MRSA or another pathogen.
3. VAP: Given the patient's need for prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Current empiric coverage for VAP is being provided, but further evaluation of the mini-BAL culture is pending.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) is slightly down, indicating possible anemia. A transfusion of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of recent infection and poor prognosis. The patient has been started on arterial line, transfused with one unit of blood with appropriate increase in hematocrit (HCT), and continued with diuresis using Lasix. The family has expressed their desire to do everything and reassess in a couple of days.

The patient's allergies include sulfonamides, specifically hives from sulfonamide antibiotics. The last doses of antibiotics given were Ciprofloxacin on 4/27/2191 at 12:00 PM, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 4/28/2191 at 02:00 AM, and Linezolid on 4/28/2191 at 04:15 AM.

The patient is currently receiving various infusions including Fentanyl at 250 mcg/hour, Furosemide (Lasix) at 18 mg/hour, Heparin Sodium at 800 units/hour, and Midazolam (Versed) at 12 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include Furosemide (Lasix), Pantoprazole (Protonix), Fentanyl, and Midazolam (Versed), which were given at different times.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for worsening ABG with a pH of 7"
