   PRELIMINARY REPORT developed by a Cardiology Fellow. Not
   reviewed/approved by the Attending Echo Physician.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 1680**] and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 1671**] is a 51 yo male with atmitted with seizure and
   dehydration, likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal.
   .
   1.  Seizure.  Patient has no history of seizures.  He has LFTs
   consistent with alcohol abuse, though patient reports he only drinks
   0-6 drinks/day and does not need to drink alcohol daily.  He
   transiently had a anion gap acidosis which may have been a transient
   lactic acidosis following the seizure.  Patient also has hyponatremia.
   Head CT did not reveal etiology of seizure, though showed evidence of
   substance abuse.  He denies headache, fevers, photophobia, nuchal
   rigidity, or elevated WBC so no need to continue abx for meningitis or
   pursue LP.  Patient requiring large amanouts of diazepam overnight due
   to elevated CIWAs.
   - diazepan 20 mg IV 1 hour prn CIWA>10, can switch to Pos today
   - seizure precations
   - monitor sodium
   - neuron consult to comment on CT head findings and need for further
   evaluation?
   .
   2.  Hyponatremia.  Patient presented with hyponatremia and reports
   symptoms of dehydration with concentrated urine.  However, urine sodium
   was high, consistent with SIADH.  Patient has history of hyponatremia
   in the past.
   - check TSH, cortisol
   - fluid restriction
   - follow Na
   .
   3.  Hypotension.  Hypotension in ED likely secondary to dehydration.
   Patient has normal lactate and no evidence of infection, so do not
   suspect sepsis.  Likely secondary to dehydration and diazepam.  EKG
   with some non-specific ST changes, but echo showed no focal wall
   abnormalities.
   - check orthostatics
   - IVFs
   - serial cardiac enzymes
   .
   4.  Alcohol abuse.  Patient denies significant alcohol abuse and
   endorses only [**12-21**] cage questions (has tried to cut back on alcohol).
   However, LFTs are consistent with alcohol abuse and CT head has
   findings consistent with substance abuse.  Stox and Utox were
   negative.  Echo shows global cardiac dysfunction, consistent with
   chronic alcohol abuse.
   - CIWA scale
   - obtain records from PCP to corroborate history of etoh abuse
   .
   5. FEN.  IVFs.  Regular diet.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a chief complaint of seizure and dehydration, likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal. The patient's history of alcohol abuse is consistent with liver function test results and findings on the head CT scan. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 111/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 5,250 mL, including 800 mL orally, 1,450 mL intravenously, and 2,455 mL output through urine. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC) at 102 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 11.5 g/dL, potassium (K+) at 3.7 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) at 126 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 94 mEq/L, and magnesium (Mg++) at 1.9 mg/dL. 

Imaging results from an echocardiogram reveal mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, trace aortic regurgitation, and suboptimal image quality that cannot rule out focal wall motion abnormality. 

The patient's plan includes continuing diazepam for alcohol withdrawal, monitoring sodium levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted with seizure and dehydration, likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal. The patient's medical history is significant for alcohol abuse, as indicated by liver function tests consistent with alcohol abuse. The patient denies significant alcohol abuse but has tried to cut back in the past.

The patient presented with hyponatremia and symptoms of dehydration. Fluid resuscitation was initiated, and the sodium levels are being monitored. The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to dehydration. IV fluids are being administered, and orthostatics are being checked. Serial cardiac enzymes are also being monitored.

The patient required an increased dose of diazepam overnight and was delirious and agitated. The patient's seizure was likely due to alcohol withdrawal. Diazepam is being administered every hour as needed, with a cutoff at CIWA score of 10.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and a mildly decreased platelet count. There is evidence of substance abuse on the head CT. No focal wall motion abnormalities were seen on the echocardiogram.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient may continue to experience seizures due to alcohol withdrawal.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels need to be closely monitored and managed appropriately to prevent complications associated with low sodium levels.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could indicate dehydration or hypovolemia,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male who was admitted with a seizure and dehydration, likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, as indicated by liver function tests (LFTs) and evidence of substance abuse on a head CT scan. He denies significant alcohol abuse and reports drinking 0-6 drinks per day, not daily. The patient had an anion gap acidosis, which may have been a transient lactic acidosis following the seizure. He also has hyponatremia and requires large amounts of diazepam overnight due to elevated CIWAs (Columbia Substance Abuse Severity Scale).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure and has no history of seizures. He has LFTs consistent with alcohol abuse, but denies needing to drink alcohol daily. The etiology of the seizure was not determined through head CT, which showed evidence of substance abuse. The patient's sodium levels were monitored, and he required large amounts of diazepam overnight due to elevated CIWAs. Seizure precautions were implemented.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient presented with hyponatremia and reported symptoms of dehydration with concentrated urine. However, his urine sodium was high, suggesting SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion). The patient's sodium levels were followed, and he received IV fluids.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is admitted to the ICU with multiple medical issues. The patient has a history of cerebellar and cerebral atrophy, suspected liver hemangiomas, fatty liver, pancytopenia, and a possible complex social situation. The patient also has low cortisol levels but normal TSH levels.

The patient has received various medications including diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate between 86-131 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/72 to 147/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show low white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatine kinase (CK) level, mildly elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and elevated troponin-T level. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Liver complications: The presence of liver hemangiomas and fatty liver increases the risk of liver-related complications such as liver failure or bleeding from the hemangiomas.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if the platelets are dysfunctional.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a seizure and dehydration, likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and denies significant alcohol consumption. Laboratory results show hyponatremia, hypotension, and signs of alcohol abuse on imaging. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential medical complications related to alcohol withdrawal, dehydration, and chronic alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur within 48-96 hours after the last drink. Symptoms include severe agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and fever.
2. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to thiamine deficiency, causing Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis. Symptoms include confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia (Wernicke's) and memory problems and confabulation (Korsakoff's).
3. Hepatitis: Chronic alcohol abuse can cause liver inflammation and damage, leading to hepatitis. Symptoms include jaundice, abdominal pain, and fatigue.
4. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy: Long-term excessive alcohol consumption can weaken the heart muscle, leading to heart failure and cardiac dysfunction.
5. Hypoglycemia: Alcohol can interfere with the release of glucose from the liver, leading to low blood"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a chief complaint of seizure and dehydration. He was admitted with suspected alcohol withdrawal. The patient's medical history includes chronic pancytopenia, possible bone marrow suppression from ethanol abuse, and a history of hyponatremia.

From the note, it appears that the patient is currently receiving treatment for alcohol withdrawal with benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium) and lorazepam (Ativan). He also received antibiotics for suspected viral infection. The patient is being closely monitored for seizures, hyponatremia, hypotension, and pancytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Seizure recurrence due to ongoing alcohol withdrawal.
2. Worsening of hyponatremia if fluid restriction is not managed properly.
3. Development of infections due to immunosuppression caused by chronic pancytopenia.
4. Further liver damage or fatty liver disease due to alcohol abuse.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and neurological status to prevent or manage these potential complications."

The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted with a seizure and dehydration, likely secondary to alcohol withdrawal. He received a total of 20 mg of Valium and 6 mg of Ativan. The patient has no known drug allergies and was given prophylactic antibiotics. He is currently on heparin sodium, diazepam, and lorazepam infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/93 to 147/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight remains unchanged since admission. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,650 mL and output of 1,325 mL, with a negative balance of 450 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support but does not require supplemental oxygen. Peripheral pulses and skin assessment are not documented. Neurologic assessment is also incomplete. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Assessment and plan include treatment for alcohol withdrawal, addressing hyponatremia, hypotension, pancytopenia, alcohol abuse, and providing nutrition and prophylactic measures. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is noted as ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo male with history of pancytopenia and evidence of chronic ETOH
   use admitted with seizure and dehydration secondary to alcohol
   withdrawal.
   .
   1.  EtOH Withdrawal
 With decreased benzo requirement overnight, now
   Q6hr. When agitated, still needs IV Ativan, but also takes the PO
   valium. No seizures overnight. Now calm, sleeping.
   - change to Q4hr CIWA scale
   - continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   - seizure precautions
   .
   2.  Alcohol abuse.  Patient denies significant alcohol abuse and
   endorses only [**12-21**] cage questions (has tried to cut back on alcohol).
   However, LFTs are consistent with alcohol abuse and CT head has
   findings consistent with substance abuse.  Stox and Utox were
   negative.  Echo shows global cardiac dysfunction, consistent with
   chronic alcohol abuse.
   - social work and follow up as outpatient for substance abuse
   - continued education
   .
   3. Pancytopenia
 chronic but slightly improved overnight. Likely [**1-19**]
   bone marrow suppression from ETOH
   -daily cbc
   .
   4.  s/p Hyponatremia.  Resolved with fluid restriction. Patient
   presented with hyponatremia and reports symptoms of dehydration with
   concentrated urine.  However, urine sodium was high, consistent with
   SIADH.  Patient has history of hyponatremia in the past.  Now
   resolved.  TSH wnl, cortisol low but [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim with some response.
   - fluid restriction
   - follow Na
   - patient may benefit from outpatient endocrine eval as he has had
   chronic hyponatremia and some episodes of hypotension
   .
   5.s/p Hypotension.  Resolved. Hypotension in ED likely secondary to
   dehydration.  Patient has normal lactate and no evidence of infection,
   so do not suspect sepsis.  Likely secondary to dehydration and
   diazepam.  EKG with some non-specific ST changes, but echo showed no
   focal wall abnormalities.  .

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of pancytopenia and chronic alcohol use. He was admitted with a seizure and dehydration secondary to alcohol withdrawal. The patient received Valium and Ativan overnight and showed improvement in his symptoms. He is currently calm and sleeping. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C (97.8Â°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/93 mmHg to 147/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Physical examination findings include sleepy but arousable patient, pupils asymmetric at baseline with the right pupil more dilated but both reactive, clear lungs bilaterally, regular heart rhythm, soft abdomen without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, and weak extremities. 

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.4 thousand/mm3, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.6 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 102 thousand/mm3, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits except for low potassium and magnesium. Other lab values include slightly elevated lactate, low albumin, and"
