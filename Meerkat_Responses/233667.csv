","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension, prostate cancer, and left nephrostomy for retroperitoneal fibrosis. He was admitted to the floor for hematuria, nausea, vomiting, and left flank pain. He received a percutaneous nephrostomy tube and was later admitted to the ICU due to increasing right flank pain, nausea, vomiting, chills, and decreased urine output. The patient has a background of diabetes mellitus, asthma, left knee cyst, chronic back pain, and no known drug allergies.

The patient presented with hypotension and was found to have a central line infection. He underwent right internal jugular vein catheterization, which improved his blood pressure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 60/40 to 110s, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Physical examination revealed mild right costovertebral angle tenderness and absent peripheral pulses. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine level, elevated blood urea nitrogen, low sodium, high potassium, and mild anemia. The patient's blood cultures grew Gram-negative rods, indicating a GNR bacteremia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Septicemia from obstructive pyelonephritis with GNR bacteremia: Continue ciprofloxacin."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension, prostate cancer, and left nephrostomy for retroperitoneal fibrosis. He was admitted to the floor for hematuria, nausea, vomiting, and left flank pain. The patient's condition has deteriorated, presenting with increasing right flank pain, nausea, vomiting, chills, and decreased urine output from the left nephrostomy. In the emergency department, his vital signs were unstable, with blood pressure readings ranging from 98/60 to 125/70 mmHg. The patient has a high white blood cell count and band percentage, indicating a possible infection. A CT abdomen showed right hydro, and he received morphine, albuterol, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's blood pressure remained low but improved after the placement of a right internal jugular (IJ) line.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, asthma, left knee cyst, chronic back pain, and no known drug allergies. His medications at home include prilosec, tamsulosin, finasteride, simvastatin, omeprazole, SSI, hep s/q, and docusate. The patient denies tobacco, drug, or alcohol use.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the current symptoms. Flow sheet data shows vital signs within normal ranges, with a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/68 to 125/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg, total fluid input of 1,863 mL, and output of 530 mL, primarily from the left nephrostomy. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has clear breath sounds with occasional wheezes.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal eye and head/neck findings. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Respiratory examination notes clear breath sounds with occasional wheezes. Abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present and mild right costovertebral angle tenderness. Extremities are absent on the right side and unobtainable on the left side. Neurologic examination shows an attentive patient who follows simple commands but has not been assessed further.

Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, elevated creatinine at 3.5 mg/dL, low hemoglobin at 7.3 g/dL, elevated potassium at 5.5 mg/dL, and mildly elevated liver enzymes. Other labs are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with septicemia from obstructive pyelonephritis with gram-negative bacilli bacteremia. He is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin and may require a percutaneous nephrostomy. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely secondary to combination of hydronephrosis and hypovolemia from sepsis. The cause of elevated bilirubin is unclear, and the patient will be monitored. Anemia will be evaluated due to mild elevated bilirubin. The cause of retroperitoneal fibrosis remains unclear. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and retroperitoneal fibrosis. He presented with right flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and acute renal failure. The patient had a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed, and cultures were obtained. He was found to have bacteremia with gram-negative rods, likely Escherichia coli. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: 
- Temperature: 38.3Â°C (100.9Â°F)
- Heart rate: 100 bpm (98-119 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 111/56 mmHg (70-124/46-88 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (14-24 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination revealed that he was pleasant, jovial, and obese. He had slight shivering and appeared to be in discomfort. His lungs were clear, and his abdomen was slightly distended with decreased bowel sounds. 

Laboratory results showed the following:
- White blood cell count: 7.7 K/uL (normal: 5.0-10.0 K/uL)
- Hematocrit: 22.2% (normal: 38.3-50.0%)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and recent percutaneous nephrostomy for hydronephrosis secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis. The patient presented with right flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and acute renal failure, which was reported during hypotension in the emergency department.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is being monitored, and IV fluid boluses are being given to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and central venous pressure (CVP) goal of 8-12. If not responsive, consideration will be given to starting pressors.
2. Pyelonephritis: The patient's increasing right flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and positive urine culture suggest pyelonephritis. Ciprofloxacin will be administered for 14 days to treat the infection.
3. Right-sided hydronephrosis: This condition is already present on CT admission. The plan is to discuss permanent indwelling nephrostomy tubes with urology and proceed with cystoscopy, bilateral retrograde pyelograms, possible bilateral ureteral stent placement, and bilateral ureteroscopy on [**7-21**].
4. Acute renal failure: This is likely secondary to obstruction in the upper urogenital tract causing hydronephrosis. Trend creatinine levels,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and a percutaneous nephrostomy for hydronephrosis secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis. He presented with right flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and acute renal failure, along with reported hypotension in the emergency department. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with hypotension, pyelonephritis, right-sided hydronephrosis, acute renal failure, isolated hyperbilirubinemia, hyperkalemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, NIDDM, asthma, and chronic low back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has bandemia, fever, and a positive urinary tract infection, which raises concerns for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and response to treatment will be important.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure could progress to AKI if not managed appropriately. Monitoring urine output, serum creatinine levels, and avoiding nephrotoxins are crucial.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a confirmed UTI, and it is essential to complete the prescribed course of antibiotics to prevent complications such as kidney infection or sepsis.
4. Obstructive uropathy: The patient's right-sided hydronephrosis may lead to further complications if not managed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, prostate cancer previously treated with radiation therapy, and retroperitoneal fibrosis leading to hydronephrosis. He presented with urosepsis and signs of right-sided hydronephrosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple conditions including hypotension due to urosepsis, pyelonephritis, and acute renal failure. He has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and his renal function is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may worsen if fluid balance is not maintained properly or if there is a further deterioration in his overall condition.
2. Pyelonephritis: Although the patient has been started on appropriate antibiotics, there is a risk of treatment failure or development of antibiotic resistance. Regular monitoring of urine cultures is important to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to hydronephrosis. If kidney function does not improve, the patient may require dialysis or further interventions to manage renal failure.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile and critically ill, there is an increased risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as the use of compression stockings and subcutaneous heparin should be continued to reduce the risk of thrombosis.
5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Adequate lung hygiene, proper positioning, and regular assessment of respiratory status are crucial in preventing this complication."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy three years ago, and a percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed for hydronephrosis secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis. He presents with urosepsis and signs of right hydronephrosis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.1Â°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 113/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and attentive neurologic status. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and positive blood cultures for Gram-negative rods (GNR), specifically Escherichia coli. The patient is diagnosed with urosepsis, pyelonephritis, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential complications such as shock.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, likely secondary to hydronephrosis, now decompressed. Continued monitoring of creatinine levels, Foley output, and nephrostomy tube output is important to assess renal function and prevent further complications.
3. Infection: The presence of GNR (Escherichia coli"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension and prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy 3 years ago. He presented with urosepsis and signs of right hydronephrosis. The patient has shown clinical improvement overnight, and is now off vasopressors. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/61 mmHg to 124/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg, and fluid balance indicates an input of 2,810 mL with an output of 2,725 mL since 12 AM. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. His cardiovascular system is normal, with clear breath sounds on respiratory examination. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Neurologic examination is also within normal limits.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 6.9 g/dL, platelet count of 143 K/uL, creatinine of 3.5 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 106 to 125 mg/dL, and other laboratory values within normal limits. Microbiology reports"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and subsequent left percutaneous nephrostomy for hydronephrosis secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis. The patient presents with right flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and acute renal failure. The patient was found to have gram-negative rod bacteremia (E. coli) and sepsis, for which he is being treated with ciprofloxacin for 14 days. Additionally, the patient is suspected to have pyelonephritis, likely causing his increasing right flank pain, nausea, vomiting, and positive urinary tract infection. There is no evidence of renal abscess on ultrasound. The patient's acute renal failure is believed to be secondary to obstruction in the upper urogenital tract causing hydronephrosis. The patient has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) for which he is taking tamsulosin and finasteride. His other medical conditions include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), asthma, and chronic low back pain. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, but they have slightly improved post-nephrostomy placement. Other notable findings include anemia and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending resolution of the above conditions in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of multi-lumen central venous line (CVL) and suspected bloodstream infection. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and anemia. Upon admission, the patient was started on ciprofloxacin for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and developed significant rigors, which improved with low-dose demerol. An ultrasound was performed to rule out abscesses in the kidneys, but it came back negative. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.1Â°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/56mmHg to 145/82mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has a pre-existing condition of chronic renal failure. This could progress further due to the current infection and inadequate renal function.
2. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of rigors and fever indicate a possible bloodstream infection. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it could lead to sepsis and potentially septic shock.
3. UTI: Although the patient was initially treated for a UTI, there is no update on the current status of the infection. If the infection"

   percutaneous nephrostomy for hydronephrosis secondary to
   retroperitoneal fibrosis, who presents with R flank pain, nausea,
   vomiting, and acute renal failure with reported hypotension in ED.
   # Hypotension: Unclear if patient with true hypotension in the ED as
   manual BP cuff readings and automatic BP cuff [**Location (un) **] were not
   correlating. BP stable since arrival, never required pressors.  Growing
   GNR from blood and urine, likely E. coli.
   -Continue ciprofloxacin X 14 days
   -Given blood for low HCT
recheck HCT later today
   -Surveillance cultures negative
   -Leukocytosis is improved
   # Pyelonephritis: Likely explains patient's increasing R flank pain,
   nausea, vomiting and + UTI.  In the past, has had pan-sensitive
   e.coli.
   - treat with ciprofloxacin x 14 days
   - f/u urine culture
   - supportive management with anti-emetic
   # R sided hydronephrosis: R percutaneous nephrostomy placed by IR
   yesterday. L perc nephrostomy in place
   # Acute Renal Failure: Likely secondary to obstruction in upper
   urogenital tract that is causing hydronephrosis.  No stones ever seen.
   Cr slightly improved post nephrostomy placement.
   -  avoid nephrotoxins
   - renally dose medications
   - send urine lytes
   - continue tamsulosin and finasteride
   - Urology consulted but continue to await recommendations--? Ok to d/c

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension and prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy three years ago. He presents with urosepsis and signs of right hydronephrosis. The patient has undergone a percutaneous nephrostomy for hydronephrosis secondary to retroperitoneal fibrosis. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated with antibiotics, meperidine, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) - The patient has acute renal failure due to obstructive uropathy and infection. Continued monitoring of kidney function and renal-dosed medications are necessary.
2. Infection - The patient has sepsis caused by E. coli UTI/pyelonephritis and GNR bacteremia. Complete 14-day course of ciprofloxacin is required. Hemodynamic stability should be maintained, and another infectious source should be ruled out.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin is being administered.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotics are necessary.
5. Pressure ulcers - Prolonged bed rest in the ICU increases the risk of developing pressure ul"
