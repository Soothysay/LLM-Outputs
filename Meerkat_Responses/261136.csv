Physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention or edema, and the cardiac examination shows a point of maximum impulse located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line. There is a regular rhythm with a third heart sound (S3) and no murmurs, lifts, or thrills. The lungs are clear, with no crackles or wheezes. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly or bruits. Extremities show palpable pulses bilaterally, and there are no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low magnesium level. Renal function is also normal. Troponin-T is within normal range, indicating no ongoing myocardial infarction."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on Doxycycline per EP for empiric treatment of  Lyme.  Lyme
   serology negative.
   - EP recs: no veg on TEE, no pacemaker today.
   - had several episodes of asystole (5 missed beats), pacer was not
   being sensed or paced appropriately.  EP called.  Pacer was thought to
   be malpositioned, adjusted.  Tele then was catching many PVCs
   suggesting pace wire was too far.  CXR confirmed this.  Readjusted with
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Was doing well for a few minutes.  Then developed paced
   tachycardia rate of 110.  (Pacer set to maintain rate > 60.)  Developed
   into polymorphic VT, with severe headache, nausea, and chest pain.
   Pace wire was pulled back 5 cm.  Stopped after 10 minutes.  Did not
   require cardioversion.  Pacer was still positioned, with some sensing
   and response.  However, was still pacing on T waves.  Pacer was turned
   off.  Pt developed pauses to 11 s.  EP called and was coming in.  Had
   more pauses.  Pt refused another attempt at temp pace wire.  Had more
   frequent pauses.  Was about to start Dopamine, when pt agreed to temp
   wire.   Temp wire placed, pacing appropriately.

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of bicuspid aortic valve presenting with pre-syncope and found to be in complete heart block. The patient has been experiencing episodes of asystole, and a temporary pacemaker wire was placed in the emergency department to provide pacing. However, the pacing caused nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT)/ventricular tachycardia (VT), requiring several readjustments. The patient's Lyme serology is negative, but he is on doxycycline for empiric treatment of Lyme conduction abnormality, although conduction abnormalities should be treated with intravenous ceftriaxone followed by three weeks of oral therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate ranging from 79 to 147 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/76 to 159/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 89.5 kg, and he has received a total of 2,160 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 2,500 mL of urine.

   24 Hour Events:
   - Started on Doxycycline per EP for empiric treatment of  Lyme.  Lyme
   serology negative.
   - EP recs: no veg on TEE, no pacemaker today.
   - had several episodes of asystole (5 missed beats), pacer was not
   being sensed or paced appropriately.  EP called.  Pacer was thought to
   be malpositioned, adjusted.  Tele then was catching many PVCs
   suggesting pace wire was too far.  CXR confirmed this.  Readjusted with
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Was doing well for a few minutes.  Then developed paced
   tachycardia rate of 110.  (Pacer set to maintain rate > 60.)  Developed
   into polymorphic VT, with severe headache, nausea, and chest pain.
   Pace wire was pulled back 5 cm.  Stopped after 10 minutes.  Did not
   require cardioversion.  Pacer was still positioned, with some sensing
   and response.  However, was still pacing on T waves.  Pacer was turned
   off.  Pt developed pauses to 11 s.  EP called and was coming in.  Had
   more pauses.  Pt refused another attempt at temp pace wire.  Had more
   frequent pauses.  Was about to start Dopamine, when pt agreed to temp
   wire.   Temp wire placed, pacing appropriately.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of a bicuspid aortic valve who presented with pre-syncope and was found to be in complete heart block (CHB). The patient has been experiencing several episodes of asystole and had a temporary pacing wire placed in the emergency department. However, the pacing wire was poorly positioned, causing nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT)/ventricular tachycardia (VT), and required readjustments. Eventually, a permanent pacemaker was placed under fluoroscopy guidance, proximal to the apex, with appropriate sensing and capturing. The patient has no history of ischemia or myocardial infarction (MI). Possible causes for the conduction disorder include aortic stenosis with calcification or Lyme disease, despite negative Lyme serology.

The patient is currently on doxycycline for empiric treatment of Lyme disease-related conduction abnormality, although conduction abnormalities should be treated with intravenous ceftriaxone followed by three weeks of oral therapy. The patient is pacing to prevent asystole and requires intravenous pacing. Telemonitoring is ongoing, and an electrophysiologist (EP) is following up. Atropine is available at the bedside, and dopamine may be used if the block persists and pacing malfunctioning continues. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed no endocarditis.

No evidence of ischemia was found on imaging. Follow-up ECG is recommended, and cardiac enzymes should be deferred cycling due to multiple events at pace wire placement. The patient has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.1cm2). There are no signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) or coronary artery disease (CAD). The syncopal episode is more likely due to CHB rather than aortic stenosis.

The patient is euvolemic on examination, and daily weights, intake/output (I/O) monitoring, and respiratory status monitoring are advised. Leukocytosis was noted with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.7, but the patient is afebrile and has no localizing symptoms. Chest X-ray (CXR) shows no consolidation, and there is no bandemia. Leukocytosis and fever curve trending is recommended.

The patient is nil per os (NPO) after midnight. Central venous access was obtained via the right internal jugular vein (RIJ). Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with heparin subcutaneously, pain management with acetaminophen (tylenol), and bowel regimen.

The patient has full code status but does not wish to be intubated if the pathology is not reversible. Current disposition is to remain in the coronary care unit"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of bicuspid aortic valve who presented with pre-syncope and was found to be in complete heart block. He had no history of ischemia or myocardial infarction, but possible aortic stenosis with calcification leading to conduction disorder was considered. The patient underwent permanent pacemaker placement on the left side and has not experienced any further abnormal rhythms.

The patient is currently on vancomycin and clindamycin, with plans for a chest X-ray in the morning. He is also taking doxycycline empirically for Lyme conduction abnormality. Tele monitoring has been initiated, and the patient's electrophysiology recommendations have been approved. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed no endocarditis.

There is no evidence of ischemia, and the patient has moderate aortic valve stenosis with a valve area of 1.1cm2. He is euvolemic on exam and will have daily weights, input/output monitoring, and respiratory status monitoring. Leukocytosis is present with a WBC count of 12, but the patient is afebrile and has no localizing symptoms. There is no consolidation on chest X-ray, and there is no bandemia.

The patient is on a cardiac diet and has peripheral"
