","The patient is a 49-year-old male with MSSA bacteremia and mitral valve endocarditis. The patient has been experiencing fever, agitation, fatigue, weakness, and pain in his legs. He also admits to shortness of breath at rest. The patient's vital signs show a high temperature, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient's physical examination reveals a new holosystolic murmur best at the apex, JVD flat, crackles at bases bilaterally, and right elbow psoriatic lesions with a thick white plaque and a break in the skin. There is also erythema and swelling extending down the right arm, marked erythema in the right hand, a prominent purplish tender nodule on the left third digit, multiple reddish petechiae on the lower extremities, and multiple non-tender nodules on the plantar surfaces of both feet. Neurological examination reveals left facial droop, left ptosis, and reduced hearing on the right side. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated troponin-T levels, and abnormalities in electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal severe emphysema and bilateral small pleural effusions. The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis and sepsis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Septic emboli leading to stroke or other organ damage.
2. Heart failure due to"

","The patient's chief complaint is MSSA bacteremia and mitral valve endocarditis. The patient has been experiencing fever, agitation, weakness, pain in the legs with movement, and shortness of breath at rest. The patient also has a history of smoking and alcohol consumption. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated with antibiotics (Nafcillin and Vancomycin) for MSSA bacteremia. The patient is also receiving Norepinephrine infusion for hypotension and Heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.1°C (102.4°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 98/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals a holosystolic murmur best at the apex, flat jugular venous distention (JVD), crackles at the lung bases bilaterally, and erythematous, swollen right elbow with a 4cm wide thick white plaque with a 2cm break in the skin. The patient also has multiple reddish petechiae on the lower extremities and non-tender nodules on the plantar surfaces of both feet.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.4 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of 0.28 ng/mL, elevated lactic acid level of 1.6 mmol/L, and decreased fibrinogen level of 861 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal severe emphysema and bilateral small pleural effusions on chest X-ray, as well as severe emphysema with architectural distortion in the upper lungs bilaterally on CT thorax.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Heart failure due to severe mitral regurgitation caused by mitral valve vegetations.
2. Septic emboli to the brain, leading to visual blurring and neurological deficits.
3. Thrombocytopenia in the setting of bacteremia and sepsis.
4. Possible MRSA cellulitis, as indicated by the presence of a thick white plaque with a break in the skin.
5. Pneumonia, suggested by the presence of crackles at the lung bases bilaterally and bilateral opacities on imaging studies.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and risk factors.
7. Stress ulcer due to ICU stay and illness.

These are just potential complications based on the information given, and further evaluation and management are required for the patient."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 5473**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Details reviewed and confirmed with family.
   Physical Examination
   Loud MR murmur.
   Erythema, warmth at R elbow; ? effusion
   + embolic skin lesions forearms and pretibial areas;
   Medical Decision Making
   Acutely ill man with Staph Aureus mitral valve endocarditis complicated
   by cerebral emboli and infarct.  He has mild congestive heart failure
   and hypotension. Hypotension related to MR (cardiogenic) versus sepsis
   or mixed picture.  If not improved my need IABP for cardiac support.
   Major issue is timing of surgery for MVR.  Will consult neurology, ID
   and cardiac surgery.  Plan for now is intensive antibiotic therapy with
   hope to delay surgery for 1-2 weeks. Will follow cultures for clearing.
   Critical care today: 30 minutes

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with MSSA bacteremia and mitral valve endocarditis. He presents with fever, agitation, fatigue, weakness, pain in his legs with movement, shortness of breath at rest, and a new murmur on examination. His vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, erythema, warmth, and tenderness at the right elbow, and embolic skin lesions on his forearms and pretibial areas. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a left shift, elevated lactate levels, and elevated cardiac enzymes. Imaging studies show severe emphysema and bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray, and multiple bilateral hypodense areas on CT head suggestive of septic emboli.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and leukocytosis. There is a risk of progression to septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of congestive heart failure with crackles at the lung bases, hypotension, and a loud murmur suggestive of mitral regurgitation due to the endocarditis.
3. Stroke: The patient's neurological symptoms, including visual blurring, left facial droop, left ptosis, and weakness in the left side of the body"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia and mitral valve endocarditis. He has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, and visual blurring. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies reveal severe emphysema, lung distortion, pleural effusions, and multiple areas of hypodensity in the brain, suggestive of septic emboli.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart failure due to severe mitral regurgitation caused by mitral valve vegetations.
2. Stroke or brain injury due to septic emboli from the infected mitral valve.
3. Development of heart block as indicated by the presence of sinus tachycardia on ECG.
4. Sepsis-related multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
5. Thrombocytopenia leading to bleeding or increased risk of infection.
6. Poor glycemic control in the setting of critical illness.
7. Complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation (e.g., ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome).
8. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
9. Infection at the site of skin breakdown, potentially leading to a secondary bacterial infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with MSSA bacteremia and mitral valve endocarditis. He is currently in the ICU and is experiencing several complications related to his condition. These include fever, agitation, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and neurological symptoms such as left facial droop, left ptosis, and reduced hearing on the right side. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and visual blurring. Imaging studies show severe emphysema and evidence of septic emboli in the brain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, agitation, fatigue, and weakness may indicate an ongoing infection and sepsis due to MSSA bacteremia.
2. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation and vegetations on the mitral valve, which can lead to heart failure and potential complications like heart block.
3. Septic Emboli: The presence of septic emboli in the brain could explain the patient's visual blurring and neurological symptoms such as left facial droop, left ptosis, and reduced hearing.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's severe emphysema puts him"

   ECHO:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
   by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
   The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   There is a probable (very small) vegetation on the aortic valve. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
   prolapse (predominantly posterior leaflet). There is probably partial
   mitral leaflet flail of the posterior leaflet. There is a probable
   vegetation on the mitral valve. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet
   of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: MVP with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with
   dilated LV cavity. Possible endocarditis. A TEE is suggested.
   Elbow Xray: (prelim)
   There is a large elbow joint effusion. No bony destruction is
   identified

   Pt was afebrile yesterday, but continues to have embolic events. ECHO
   shows large vegetation on mitral valve, probably small vegetation on
   aortic valve.
   - on culture data staph aureus is MSSA (OSH)
   - f/u cardiac surgery evaluation for surgical repair of mitral valve
   leaflet given hypotension and likely septic emboli to brain
   - check serial ECG to follow for heart block
   - ID recs appreciated: continue Nafcillin, Gentamicin added [**1-16**] for

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, and neurological deficits. He has been experiencing embolic events, sepsis, and hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress, an erythematous and swollen elbow with a possible septic joint, elevated INR, and a history of heavy smoking. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis: This is a serious infection of the heart valves, which can lead to further valve damage, heart failure, and embolic events.
2. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing fever and positive blood cultures indicate a systemic infection, which can progress to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Neurological deficits: The patient has shown signs of neurological impairment, including left-sided weakness, ptosis, facial droop, and neglect. These symptoms may be due to septic emboli affecting the brain.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's oxygen requirements and desaturation episodes suggest respiratory distress, which could be related to pulmonary edema secondary to severe mitral regurgitation.
5. Septic joint: The erythematous and swollen elbow with a possible open wound raises concerns for a septic joint. Prompt evaluation and treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.

   ECHO:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
   by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
   The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   There is a probable (very small) vegetation on the aortic valve. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
   prolapse (predominantly posterior leaflet). There is probably partial
   mitral leaflet flail of the posterior leaflet. There is a probable
   vegetation on the mitral valve. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet
   of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: MVP with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with
   dilated LV cavity. Possible endocarditis. A TEE is suggested.
   Elbow Xray: (prelim)
   There is a large elbow joint effusion. No bony destruction is
   identified

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   New neurologic symptoms with R sided weakness and neglect.
   Physical Examination
   Resting without apparent respiratory distress.
   [**4-22**] holosystolic murmur. No diastolic murmur. No gallop
   R arm neglect and apparent R hemiplegia.
   Medical Decision Making
   Acute mitral valve staph endocarditis.  Of concern is possible
   recurrent cerebral embolic event on antibiotic therapy. He has been
   afebrile x >24 hours.  Have discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3641**] of cardiac surgery
   with hope for urgent surgery.  He has requested MRI of R arm to help
   exclude abscess or other deep infection requiring drainage.  Will
   probably need cardiac cath for coronary anatomy prior to MVR.  Continue
   current antibiotic therapy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a diagnosis of staphylococcus aureus endocarditis and severe mitral regurgitation. The patient has experienced multiple embolic events and neurological deficits. The patient's physical examination revealed several significant findings including a holosystolic murmur, right-sided neglect, left facial droop, left ptosis, and decreased strength on the right side. Laboratory results showed an elevated white blood cell count and a positive blood culture for GPC in pairs/clusters. Imaging studies such as a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and a CT scan of the head were performed, which revealed large vegetations on the mitral valve, a probable small vegetation on the aortic valve, and evidence of septic emboli to the brain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Heart Failure: Due to the severe mitral regurgitation, there is a risk of developing heart failure. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload and adjusting treatment accordingly will be important.

2. Sepsis: Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia has already been identified, and the patient remains at risk for further sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.

3. Neurological Deficits: The patient has experienced neurological deficits including left facial droop, left ptosis, right-sided neglect, and decreased strength on the right side. Further evaluation with an MRI of"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 M found to have staphlyococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis with
   severe mitral regurgitation [**3-21**] mitral valve vegetations and flail
   leaflet, course c/b sepsis, neurological deficits.
   # Mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis/ Sepsis [**3-21**]
   staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: BCx grew out GPC in pairs/clusters.
   Pt was afebrile yesterday, but continues to have embolic events. ECHO
   shows large vegetation on mitral valve, probable small vegetation on
   aortic valve.
   - on culture data staph aureus is MSSA, contiue surveillance cultures
   - f/u cardiac surgery evaluation for surgical repair of mitral valve
   leaflet given hypotension and likely septic emboli to brain
   - requires teeth pulled prior to CT surgery;
   - check serial ECG to follow for heart block
   - ID recs appreciated: continue Nafcillin, Gentamicin added [**1-16**] for
   continued positive BCx; check Gent peak/trough tomorrow; obtain MR
   spine when pt goes for MR head
   - [**Hospital1 **] Lytes
   # Neurological deficits - had CT head at [**Location (un) 196**] read as small infarct
   in the anterior and posterior circulation suspicious for septic emboli.
   Neuro exam here with generalized weakness, left side ptosis and facial
   droop.  Palate rises asymmetrically.  Pt lost sensation to RUE and RLE
   [**1-16**], increased weakness on R side, R sided neglect. Repeat CT head
   shows L PCA infarct
   - neuro recs appreciated: obtain MRI head to evaluate lesion burden
   when stable, CT angio head/neck in 2 weeks to r/o mycotic aneurysm
   - final treatment would be surgery, however remains high risk given new
   large area strokes.
   # Respiratory Distress
 pt continues to have O2 requirement 6L -> 4L.
   Desats to high 80s on RA. Likely [**3-21**] to pulmonary edema from MR. Pt
   does not appear fluid overloaded and does not need diuresis at this
   time. Continue to monitor and wean O2 as tolerated.
   #Elbow erythema/open wound
 concern for septic joint low given full
   ROM without pain joint. No aspiration at this time. Xray shows
   effusion, but no evidence of bony destruction.
   - Ortho recs: continue abx, excision of his bursa as oupt
   #Hypotension
 [**3-21**] to sepsis. Pt weaned off levophed [**1-16**].
   - bolus IVF for low UOP and CVP<8 , Goal MAP >60
   - consider balloon pump if heart failure worsens, as pt requires
   afterload reduction despite low BP
   # Elevated INR
s INR increased to 1.8. DIC labs sent.
   - no evidence of DIC, per labs
   - INR 1.2 after 5mg Vit K
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD but heavy smoker
   # PUMP: Bedside ECHO done [**1-16**]. EF 55-60%.
   # RHYTHM:  Sinus tachycardia likely [**3-21**] volume depletion and
   bacteremia.
   #ACCESS: Right IJ triple lumen catheter
 placed [**1-16**]

   # Mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis/ Sepsis [**3-21**]
   staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: BCx grew out GPC in pairs/clusters.
   Pt was afebrile yesterday, but continues to have embolic events. ECHO
   shows large vegetation on mitral valve, probable small vegetation on
   aortic valve.
   - on culture data staph aureus is MSSA, contiue surveillance cultures
   - f/u cardiac surgery evaluation for surgical repair of mitral valve
   leaflet given hypotension and likely septic emboli to brain
   - requires teeth pulled prior to CT surgery;
   - check serial ECG to follow for heart block
   - ID recs appreciated: continue Nafcillin, Gentamicin added [**1-16**] for
   continued positive BCx; f/u Gent peak/trough; obtain MR spine when pt
   goes for MR head

   in the anterior and posterior circulation suspicious for septic emboli.
   Neuro exam here with generalized weakness, left side ptosis and facial
   droop.  Palate rises asymmetrically.  Pt lost sensation to RUE and RLE
   [**1-16**], increased weakness on R side, R sided neglect. Repeat CT head
   shows L PCA infarct
   - neuro recs appreciated: obtain MRI head to evaluate lesion burden
   when stable, CT angio head/neck in 2 weeks to r/o mycotic aneurysm
   - final treatment would be surgery, however remains high risk given new
   large area strokes.
   # Respiratory Distress
 pt continues to have O2 requirement 6L -> 4L.
   Desats to high 80s on RA. Likely [**3-21**] to pulmonary edema from MR. Pt
   does not appear fluid overloaded and does not need diuresis at this

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, and neurological deficits. He is currently in the ICU for sepsis and respiratory distress. The patient has had multiple embolic events and a large vegetation on the mitral valve, with a probable small vegetation on the aortic valve. He has received antibiotics, including Nafcillin and Gentamicin, but continues to have positive blood cultures. The patient's neurological exam shows generalized weakness, left side ptosis and facial droop, and increased weakness on the right side with neglect. He also has lost sensation to the right upper and lower extremities. The patient's vital signs include tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated respiratory rate. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelets, with decreased hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and calcium levels. The patient's imaging studies reveal a new left temporal-occipital hypodensity consistent with a PCA territory infarct, as well as a patent circle of Willis. He has also had a CT angiography of the head and neck, which showed no aneurysms or AVMs. The patient's other medical conditions include ARF (acute renal failure), elbow erythema/open wound, hypotension, elevated INR, and elevated troponin levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of tobacco use and alcohol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and sepsis, and later diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis involving the mitral valve. The patient has neurological deficits, impaired skin integrity, and a knowledge deficit. He is currently being treated for multiple medical complications including pneumonia, sepsis, endocarditis, respiratory distress, acute renal failure, an open wound on the elbow, hypotension, elevated INR, and potential coronary artery disease. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels. He is receiving various medications and interventions to manage his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Bacterial Endocarditis: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis, which is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. If left untreated, it can cause further complications such as heart valve damage, embolic events, and systemic spread of infection.

3. Neurological Deficits: The patient presents with neurological deficits including left facial droop, left ptosis, weakness on the right side, neglect, and sensory loss on the right upper and lower extremities. These symptoms suggest possible brain"

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction, bacterial pneumonia, and bacterial endocarditis. The patient underwent an orotracheal intubation due to respiratory distress.

On examination, the patient is tachycardic with a heart rate of 115 beats per minute. Blood pressure is low at 109/67 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is in the low 90s. The patient has a holosystolic murmur best at the apex and JVD flat. Lung examination reveals labored breathing with accessory muscles of respiration, diffuse expiratory wheeze, and crackles at the bases bilaterally. Neurological examination shows left facial droop, left ptosis, right-sided neglect, and decreased sensation on the right upper and lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.4 K/uL. Hemoglobin is 12.1 g/dL, hematocrit is 46.4%, and platelet count is 323 K/uL. Blood cultures grew out gram-positive cocci in pairs/clusters, identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Troponin-T is elevated at 0.28 ng/mL. Creatinine has increased to 1.3 mg/dL. Liver enzymes are within normal limits. Chest X-ray shows"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, bacterial sepsis without organ dysfunction, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, impaired skin integrity, knowledge deficit, bacterial endocarditis, and altered mental status.

The patient underwent right olecranon bursa drainage and joint aspiration, which showed no evidence of infection. However, the patient's urine output (UOP) has reduced, and there is evidence of fluid overload as indicated by the fluid balance.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 109/67 mmHg to 118/82 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits at 21 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is consistently above 95%.

Physical examination reveals several abnormalities, including a new 4 cm wide thick white plaque with a 2 cm break in the skin on the right elbow, erythema and swelling of the right elbow and hand, a prominent purplish tender nodule on the left third digit (Osler's node), multiple reddish petechiae on lower extremities, multiple non-tender papules on palmar and plantar surfaces, left facial droop, left ptosis, right-sided neglect, and decreased sensation on the right upper and lower extremities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He underwent right olecranon bursa drainage and joint aspiration, with no evidence of infection. The patient's urine output has reduced, and his Sats are in the low 90s. He has a history of tobacco use and alcohol abuse. The patient is currently on several medications including gentamicin, cefepime, vancomycin, nafcillin, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This can lead to respiratory complications such as hypoxia, further deterioration in mental status, and potential sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis without organ dysfunction. If not managed promptly, it can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
3. Endocarditis: The patient has a known history of bacterial endocarditis. This condition can lead to heart valve damage, embolic events, and systemic infections.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
5. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status is described as altered rather than delirious, it is important to monitor for signs of delirium, which can include confusion, agitation, and disorientation.
6. Fluid Imbalance: The"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a disheveled appearing male with a history of tobacco use and alcohol abuse. He was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient underwent right olecranon bursa drainage and joint aspiration, which showed no evidence of infection. A wound vacuum was placed, and the patient's urine output has improved with a Foley catheter in place.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax): 38.8°C (101.8°F)
- Temperature (Tcurrent): 37.8°C (100.1°F)
- Heart rate (HR): 115 bpm (range: 95-115 bpm)
- Blood pressure (BP): 109/67 mmHg (with a range of 76-118/51-82 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate (RR): 21 breaths per minute (range: 13-21 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 97% on nasal cannula

The patient has a holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex and a flat jugular venous distension (JVD). Lung auscultation reveals crackles at the bases bilaterally. The abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender. The patient exhibits erythema and swelling in the right elbow with a wide thick white plaque and a break in the skin. There"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   49 year old male presents with MSSA bacteremia, fever, malaise, and
   temp to 102. Pt had visual changes afetr admission prompting head CT
   demonstrating  a large parieto-occipital infarct thought to be
   secondary to septic emboli. In addition, the patient's creat has
   increase from 0.4 at baseline to 1.3 currently with oliguria and
   increasing shortness of breath. Echo consistent with multiple
   vegetations on the MV leaflets with torn cordae and severe mitral
   regurgitation. Nafcillin is the current antiobiotic as genta has been
   stopped. This morning the patient complained of more weakness and
   lethargy with severe dizziness and vertigo. This prompted a stat CT
   hwich showed no change in the size of the CVAs and no evidence of
   hemmorhagic conversion. Although cultures have been negative, the
   source of infection is felt to be an infected olecranon bursae on the
   right elbow which has since been debrided.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - course rales bilaterally
   heart - pansystolic murmur with an inaudible S2 and a soft decrescendo
   diastolic murmur
   ext - no [**Hospital 10310**]
   Medical Decision Making
   49 year old male with grave prognosis secondary to MSSA infective
   endocarditis. There is evidence of septic emboli involving the left had
   fingers and both feet and toes. Main concern if progressive
   desaturation and evidence of CHF on CXR. I have discussed the situation
   with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3641**] of c-[**Doctor First Name 91**] and he stated  that he would like to wait at
   least until after the weekend for surgery as he has been told by
   neurology that there is a 50% chance of hemmorhagic conversion with
   high dose heparin introperatively. For now we will continue Nafcillin
   and speak with ID about renal dosing and if this antibiotic can
   contribute to renal failure. Regarding CHF we will start Milrinone drip
   for afterload reduction and follow the BP closely. IABP is not
   unreasonable at this point but is also high risk given the patient's
   septic emboli and the need for heparin for the balloon pump. I suspect
   the patient will require renal replacement therapy as he is now
   oliguric and has known septic emboli to the kidneys and renal infarcts.
   We will start a lasix drip and start CVVHD if needed. We will consult
   renal to ask them their opinion on immune complex (C3 mediated)
   glomerulonephritis in the setting of Staph Aureus endocarditis/ sepsis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath, and he has been experiencing increasing respiratory distress. He also complains of nausea and decreased sensation on the right side. The patient's medical history includes MSSA bacteremia, fever, malaise, and visual changes after admission.

The patient's physical examination findings include a pansystolic murmur with an inaudible S2 and a soft decrescendo diastolic murmur. There are also coarse rales bilaterally in the lungs, and the patient has erythematous and edematous right hand with a prominent purplish, tender nodule on the left third digit (Osler's). Multiple reddish petechiae are present on the lower extremities, and there are non-tender papules on the palmar and plantar surfaces.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal coagulation profile. The chest X-ray reveals extensive bilateral opacities consistent with pulmonary edema. The head CT without contrast shows little change from the prior study, with no acute hemorrhage.

The patient's current assessment and plan include pneumonia, bacterial sepsis without organ dysfunction, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, impaired skin integrity, knowledge deficit, bacterial endocarditis, and altered mental status. The patient is currently on nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, and neurological deficits. He has had multiple renal infarcts, septic emboli to the brain, and is experiencing worsening respiratory distress due to acute mitral valve regurgitation. The patient's creatinine levels have increased to 1.5 today (baseline 0.4) in the setting of multiple renal infarcts, recent gentamicin use, contrast load, and low CO from MR. He also has a history of olecranon bursitis, which was treated with washout and wound vacuum placement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis secondary to Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. This can lead to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not promptly treated.

2. Neurological Deficits: The patient has neurological deficits including left-sided weakness, facial droop, ptosis, and neglect. These symptoms may be due to septic emboli affecting the brain. Further evaluation with an MRI head and spine is recommended once the patient is stabilized.

3. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing increasing respiratory distress in the setting of acute MR. This can be attributed to pulmonary edema and low cardiac output. Close monitoring of oxygen requirements and adjustment of vasodilators may be necessary.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   PA line placed last afternoon and demonstrated low filling pressures so
   patient received a total of 1 L fluid bolus. Blood pressure improved
   with bolus and holding Milrinone. Patient was quite confused overnight
   and remains A and O times 1 this am. Antiobiotic coverage has been
   broadened per ID as patient continues to have intermittent temp spikes
   and WBC ct is fluctuating around 14k. Patient now on Cefipime, Vanco IV
   and Flagyl IV day #2 to cover MSSA (nafcillin has been d/c'd) as well
   as gut pathogens. We will empirically add PO Vanco given the severe
   amount of diarrhea and suspicion of C. Dif despite negative c dif toxin
   titers.
   PA line this am with CVP 8 and PAD 20. PCW has large v-waves to 40 mm
   Hg. Creatinine has stabilized at 1.3mg/dl. Plan per c-[**Doctor First Name 91**] is to hold
   off on MVR and AVR for as long as clinically safe given the recent
   large embolic CVA and ongoing temp spikes. Will speak with OMS about
   timing of caried teeth extraction.
","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of bacterial endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, and neurological deficits. He has been admitted to the ICU for sepsis and pneumonia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including tobacco use, alcohol abuse, impaired skin integrity, and knowledge deficit. His current conditions include pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, knowledge deficit, bacterial endocarditis, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can worsen if not treated appropriately.
3. Bacterial endocarditis: The patient has bacterial endocarditis, which can lead to complications such as heart valve damage, embolic events, and further systemic infections.
4. Neurological deficits: The patient has neurological deficits, including weakness, ptosis, facial droop, and neglect. These symptoms may progress if not managed effectively.
5. Renal failure: The patient is showing signs of renal dysfunction, as indicated by the worsening creatinine levels. This could be due to factors such as multiple renal infarcts, recent gentamicin use, contrast load, and low cardiac output.
6. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which can be attributed to sepsis, low cardiac output, and possibly the"

   CT sinus: minimal mucosal thickening of ethmoid air cells, frontal and
   maxillary sinuses.  Extensive dental disease
   Assessment and Plan
   49 M found to have staphlyococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis with
   severe mitral regurgitation [**3-21**] mitral valve vegetations and [**Month/Day (2) 5817**]
   leaflet, course c/b sepsis, neurological deficits.
   #Hypotension: febrile with hypotension yesterday in setting of
   aggressive diuresis with lasix drip (-1.15 L).  Etiology multifactorial
   from sepsis, hypovolemia, possible low cardiac output from MR.
   Possible sources of infections includes GI (abscess, ischemia from
   emboli, cdiff) despite neg CT, PNA, line infection, UTI, recurrent
   bacteremia secondary to endocarditis
   - monitor CVP and pulmonary wedge pressure: keep pressure low if
   tolerated by BP given propensity for MR and pulmonary edema
   - cont broadened antibiotic coverage with vanc, cefepime, flagyl for
   hospital acquired infections
   - add PO vanc for empiric coverage of cdiff given copious diarrhea
   - f/u blood, urine, stool cx
    # Mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis/ Sepsis [**3-21**]
   staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: BCx grew out GPC in pairs/clusters.
   Pt was febrile in the setting of OR yesterday, WBC stable at 14. ECHO
   shows large vegetation on mitral valve, probable small vegetation on
   aortic valve.  Cx by acute MV regurgitation
   - cont cefepime for MSSA coverage, will narrow to nafcillin if cx
   negative
   - continue daily surveillance cultures: last positive cx on [**1-14**]
   - f/u cardiac surgery evaluation for surgical repair of mitral valve
   leaflet given hypotension and likely septic emboli to brain
   - requires teeth pulled prior to CT surgery
   - oral [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult today
   - monitor for new embolic events: if abdominal pain worsens would
   consider CT abdomen with contrast to evaluate for emboli to small bowel
   - f/u ID recs - ? require further workup for fevers.
   # Neurological deficits
 CT head with multiple bilateral emboli;
   neurological deficits improving with time.  AMS and delirium more
   consistent with ICU psychosis and toxic metabolic syndrome, although
   frontal lobe infarcts could be contributing to behavioral disturbance
   - MRI head and spine once patient stabilized
   - repeat CT angio head/neck in 2 weeks to r/o mycotic aneurysm
   - final treatment would be surgery, however remains high risk of
   hemorrhagic conversion (approx 50%)
   - f/u neuro recs.
   - zyprexa prn agitation
   # Respiratory Distress
 increasing respiratory distress in the setting
   of acute MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5817**] leaflet/ MV vegetation.  CXR consistent with
   pulmonary edema, no evidence for PNA.  Currently sating low 90s on 6L
   NC.
   - consider restarting lasix gtt to increase urine output and improve
   respiratory status
   - follow O2 requirement
   #ARF
 creatinine slightly improved to 1.3 (peak of 1.5 yesterday from
   baseline 0.4) in setting of multiple renal infarcts, recent gentamycin
   use, contrast load and low CO from MR, possible ATN from IV dye, recent
   naficillin use.
   - renally dose all meds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis and severe mitral regurgitation. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, neurological deficits, respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, and hypoalbuminemia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the current condition include:

1. worsening of mitral regurgitation leading to congestive heart failure
2. development of new embolic events such as stroke or myocardial infarction
3. progression of sepsis and septic shock
4. worsening of renal function and possible need for dialysis
5. exacerbation of respiratory distress and potential development of pneumonia
6. further neurological decline or development of new neurological deficits
7. worsening of hypoalbuminemia and malnutrition
8. possible development of new infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or Clostridioides difficile infection

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, cardiac function, renal function, respiratory status, and neurological status to promptly identify and manage any potential complications. Additionally, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and surgical evaluation for valve repair should be considered."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of tobacco use and alcohol abuse, presenting with symptoms of acute dyspnea and tachycardia in the setting of anxiety surrounding NGT placement. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, knowledge deficit, and altered mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for these conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/69 mmHg to 96/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus tachycardia. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal kidney function. Imaging studies show minimal mucosal thickening in the sinuses and no intra-abdominal or pelvic abscesses. The patient's overall condition is improving, and surgery has been delayed for another week. The patient is expected to undergo a CT scan of the maxillary sinus tomorrow, after evaluation by oral surgery. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ dysfunction due to sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. However, there is a risk of developing organ dysfunction if the infection continues to spread"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, impaired skin integrity, knowledge deficit, and possible endocarditis. The patient also has altered mental status and extensive dental disease.

The patient experienced an episode of acute dyspnea and tachycardia related to anxiety surrounding a nasogastric tube placement. A stat chest X-ray showed improving pulmonary edema. The patient's right lower extremity Doppler was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Oral surgery will evaluate the patient tomorrow after a CT scan of the maxillary sinus, and the patient will not go to the operating room until Monday at the earliest.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), current temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 110 bpm with a normal range of 95-125 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/43 mmHg to 119/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a normal range of 14-26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula, and sinus tachycardia as the heart rhythm.

The patient's weight has increased from 63 kg at admission to 70.5 kg currently. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is 44/22 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is 10 mmHg. Cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) are 7.3 L/min and 4.1 L/min/m2, respectively. Mixed venous oxygen saturation is 75-76%. Total fluid input is 3,054 mL, with 315 mL output through the urinary system. Blood products totaling 2,445 mL have been transfused, and 410 mL has been output through the urinary system. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has an oxygen saturation of 95%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count (Plt), increased creatinine (Cr), lactate, and D-dimer levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. Imaging studies include a CT abdomen/pelvis showing no intra-abdominal or pelvic abscesses, and a CT sinus revealing minimal mucosal thickening and extensive dental disease.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management due to the presence of pneumonia, sepsis, impaired skin integrity, and potential endocarditis. Ongoing assessment and treatment are necessary to address these medical complications and ensure the patient's well-being."

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of bacterial endocarditis, sepsis, neurological deficits, pneumonia, alcohol abuse, impaired skin integrity, and knowledge deficit. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient had an episode of acute dyspnea and tachycardia in the setting of anxiety surrounding NGT placement, but a stat CXR showed improving pulmonary edema.
- CT surgery thinks the patient has stabilized enough to delay surgery for another week.
- RUE doppler negative for DVT.
- Oral surgery will evaluate the patient tomorrow after a CT scan of the maxillary sinus, and the patient will not go to OR until Monday at the earliest.
- At 4 pm, the patient became febrile and hypotensive with a MAP < 60; lasix and milrinone were given, and a swan catheter with low PCW (10) was inserted. Transiently started dopamine 4mcg/kg/min and received 1L NS in total.
- Broadened coverage to cefepime/flagyl to cover possible abdominal infection.
- The patient was delirious and agitated in the morning after insomnia with multiple nighttime awakenings. Gave zyprexa 5mg x 1.
- Allergies include penicillin G.
- The last doses of antibiotics were gentamicin on [**2113-1-18**] 06:00 PM, nafcillin on [**2113-1-20**] 06:32 PM, cefepime on [**2113-1-20**] 06:33 PM, vancomycin on [**2113-1-20**] 10:58 PM, and metronidazole on [**2113-1-21**] 02:00 AM.
- The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.4 C (101.1 F), current temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), heart rate of 110 bpm (95-125 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 119/69 mmHg to 96/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (14-26 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus tachycardia.
- The patient's physical examination reveals general normal appearance, difficulty assessing jugular venous distension due to central line placement, clear lungs anteriorly, regular rhythm with a soft S2, holosystolic murmur best at the apex, soft non-distended non-tender abdomen, and 2+ pitting edema. The patient also has [**Doctor First Name **] way lesions on palmar and plantar surfaces, and Osler nodes.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/76 to 146/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and a temperature of 37.8-37.7°C. The patient's physical examination reveals generalized weakness, left-sided ptosis and facial droop, asymmetric palate elevation, and sensory loss on the right upper and lower extremities. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, along with low albumin, potassium, and magnesium levels. Imaging studies show multiple bilateral infarcts on the head CT scan and minimal maxillary, frontal, and ethmoid sinus disease on the sinus CT. The patient's current medications include nafcillin, vancomycin, Lasix, ativan, haldol, pantoprazole, furosemide, and haloperidol. The patient's plan includes continuing broadened antibiotic coverage, monitoring for new embolic events, evaluating cardiac surgery recommendations, following oral consultation recommendations, and assessing neurological deficits.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient was extremely agitated last night requiring ativan and high
   doses of haloperidol. He is more somnolent this am and is appropriate.
   He received lasix boluses throughout the day yesterday and remains -500
   cc this am in 24 hours. All cultures including multiple different
   c.dificile assays have been negative. Right elbow bursa culture is also
   negative. He remains on Flagyl, Cefipime and vanco Day # 3 and is now
   off Nafcillin for MSSA. ID has placed their recommendations in the
   chart that the patient be taken to the OR more immediately for MVR as
   they feel the chance of hemmorhagic conversion from the CVAs is about
   10-20% and not 50% as earlier stated by neurology. ID feels there is a
   greater risk of large ebolization of a valvular vegetation. I will
   speak with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] from c-[**Doctor First Name 91**] about this. We will speak with Psych
   about a regular dose of zyprexa or haldol in the late afternoon and
   evening to avoid severe sundowning. Will place a Dobhoff feeding tube
   today and resume sq heparin for dvt prophylaxis.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, and neurological deficits. He has been experiencing episodes of anxiety, agitation, and combativeness, requiring the administration of Ativan and Haldol. His respiratory distress has been increasing due to acute MR and vegetation on the mitral valve. The patient has shown improvement in creatinine levels but still exhibits hypoalbuminemia, likely due to poor nutrition. He has multiple comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, right olecranon bursitis, and a history of smoking.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis, which increases the risk of sepsis. Close monitoring for signs of infection and septic emboli is necessary.
2. Neurological Deficits: The patient has neurological deficits, including weakness on the right side, neglect, and facial droop. Further evaluation with MRI head and spine is recommended, along with monitoring for new embolic events.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is worsening, possibly due to acute MR and vegetation on the mitral valve. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is crucial.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has shown improvement in creatinine levels but remains at risk for acute renal failure due to"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis and severe mitral regurgitation. He has neurological deficits and was found to have multiple bilateral infarcts on repeat CT head. The patient also has delirium, respiratory distress, acute renal failure, olecranon bursitis, hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and a history of smoking. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation due to endocarditis, which can lead to heart failure and further embolic events.
2. Neurological complications: The patient has neurological deficits and multiple bilateral infarcts, indicating a risk of ongoing ischemic events or hemorrhagic conversion.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient is experiencing increasing respiratory distress, possibly due to pulmonary edema and low cardiac output.
4. Renal complications: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be due to multiple renal infarcts, recent gentamicin use, contrast load, and low cardiac output.
5. Infectious complications: Despite negative cultures, there is a concern for ongoing infection, particularly with the presence of endocarditis and the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, indicating poor nutrition and a potential risk for further complications such as pressure ulcers or"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, and neurological deficits. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, renal failure, delirium, respiratory distress, hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and a history of olecranon bursitis.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further embolic events: The patient's neurological deficits suggest that he may have experienced embolic strokes in the past. It is important to monitor for any new embolic events, particularly if the abdominal pain worsens, as this could indicate an embolus to the small bowel.

2. Development of a mycotic aneurysm: Given the patient's endocarditis and neurological deficits, there is a risk of developing a mycotic aneurysm, particularly in the cerebral vessels. Repeat CT angiography of the head and neck should be performed to rule out this condition.

3. Progression of renal failure: The patient's renal function has improved, but there is still a risk of further deterioration due to multiple factors such as recent gentamicin use, contrast load, and low cardiac output. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is necessary.

4. Complications related to teeth extraction: The patient is scheduled for teeth extraction, which carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   The patient remains hemodynamically stable on Milrinone 05 mcg/kg/min.
   and intermittent Lasix boluses. TEE today was not done due to patient
   non-compliance. Plan is to bring patient to the OR today for caried
   teeth extraction by OMS and we will try to obtain TEE at that time.
   Further, we will plan for left heart cath tomorrow to define coronary
   anatomy in anticipation of MVR +/- AVR in the near future. Creat now
   stable at 0.9 and WBC ct has decreased from 20 --> 15 K with less
   diarrhea and PO Vancomycin. Patient remains on Vanco, Cefipime and
   Flagyl Day # 4 and Nafcillin is off. I have discussed the case with Dr
   [**First Name (STitle) **] of c-[**Doctor First Name 91**] and he will see the patient today. We will aim to the
   OR on Wednesday of Thursday. [**Name (NI) **] wife, [**Name (NI) 1880**], is aware of the
   patient's progress and has been present throughout most of the
   hospitalization. The agitation and sundowning has improved on standing
   [**Hospital1 **] Haldol.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2506**], Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of bacterial endocarditis, neurological deficits, and sepsis. He is currently in the ICU and has been admitted for several weeks. The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications including mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, large vegetation on the mitral valve, possible small vegetation on the aortic valve, renal failure, delirium, respiratory distress, loose stools, and neurological deficits. The patient has had several procedures and interventions including tooth extraction, placement of a left subclavian line, and cardiac catheterization. The patient's current medications include broad-spectrum antibiotics, Haldol, Ativan, Lasix, Milrinone, and tube feeds. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation and vegetation on the mitral valve, which increases the risk of heart failure, arrhythmias, and embolic events.
2. Renal complications: The patient has renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening kidney function and fluid imbalance.
3. Neurological complications: The patient has neurological deficits and remains at risk for further neurological decline, including potential embolic events to the brain.
4. Infective complications: The patient has ongoing infection with Staphylococcus aureus, and there"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a diagnosis of staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, sepsis, neurological deficits, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infective Endocarditis: The patient has an ongoing infection of the heart valves caused by staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This condition can lead to further valve damage, embolic events, and systemic spread of infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient's immune response to the bacterial infection has resulted in systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Neurological Deficits: The patient has experienced neurological deficits including left-sided weakness, facial droop, and neglect. These symptoms are likely due to septic emboli affecting the brain and may require further evaluation and management.
4. Mitral Valve Regurgitation: The severe mitral regurgitation indicates significant damage to the mitral valve, leading to impaired cardiac function and potential complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has an improvement in creatinine levels, suggesting acute kidney injury or renal failure. This may be due to multiple factors such as renal infarcts, recent gentamicin use, contrast exposure, and low cardiac output.
6. Pulmonary Edema: The patient exhibits signs of respiratory distress and pulmonary"

The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, neurological deficits, delirium, respiratory distress, acute renal failure (ARF), olecranon bursitis, hypoalbuminemia, and coronary artery disease.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation and a history of staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. There is a risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.

2. Neurological complications: The patient has neurological deficits and a history of multiple large infarcts in the brain. There is a risk of worsening neurological function or development of new neurological deficits.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections due to prolonged intubation.

4. Renal complications: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a baseline creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL. There is a risk of worsening renal function or progression to chronic kidney disease.

   after great disucussion within the primary team, the risks outweight
   the benefits.  Risk of hemorrhagic conversion is thought to be
   significantly reduced after the first three days.  Pt already has

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 10242**] continues to slowly improve. Head CT yesterday shows
   evolution of the left parietal and occipital stroke as well as the left
   frontal region with no new hemorrhage. Twelve teeth were removed in the
   OR without complication. TEE was not performed as the patient would not
   tolerate this test. Central line re-sited to the left subclavian. Pt
   remains intubated and wbc ct down from 20k to 13k on PO Vanco D#2 and
   IV Vanco, Cefipime and Flagyl Day # 5. Today we will get an MRI of the
   L-S spine to rule out an epidural abscess (with gado) and follow that
   with a Cardiac cath to define coronary anatomy in anticipation of
   cardiac surgery by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] on Thursday. We have discussed the plan in
   detail with [**Doctor First Name 1880**] who seems to be getting a bit discouraged by the
   patient's prolonged illness.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health care proxy. [**Name (NI) **] seen and
   examined without input from resident(s) or fellow(s). I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 568**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes of critical care time.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2113-1-24**] 06:55 PM ------
","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted with staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, and neurological deficits. He underwent teeth extraction and is scheduled for cardiac catheterization tomorrow. The patient has a history of multiple large infarcts in the brain, pneumonia, and a previous positive blood culture for MSSA. He also has delirium, respiratory distress, acute renal failure, olecranon bursitis, hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation due to staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. There is a possibility of further cardiac complications during the cardiac catheterization procedure or surgery.
2. Neurological complications: The patient has neurological deficits and multiple large infarcts in the brain. There is a risk of worsening neurological status or development of new neurological symptoms.
3. Infection: The patient has ongoing infection with staphylococcus aureus and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance or development of new infections.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and has respiratory distress. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
5. Renal complications: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening renal function or development of renal insufficiency.

- The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, and neurological deficits.
- He was intubated and underwent teeth extraction in the operating room.
- The patient has multiple large infarcts in the left PCA territory on CT head w/o contrast.
- He has severe bullous emphysema, moderate pulmonary edema or pneumonia, and small to moderate-sized left and small right pleural effusions on CXR.
- The patient's blood cultures grew out MSSA, and he has vegetations on the mitral valve, possible small vegetation on the aortic valve.
- Surgery is essential for recovery, but the risks outweigh the benefits.
- The patient has loose stools since admission, which are negative for C. difficile.
- His neurological deficits continue to improve.
- He is agitated and requires Haldol and Ativan.
- The patient's creatinine level is stable at 0.9 (baseline 0.4).
- He has a history of olecranon bursitis, which was treated with washout and wound vac.
- The patient has hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and coronary artery disease.
- He has a pump EF of 55-60% and is on milrinone.

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 10242**] had a stable night and remains intubated and ventilated by
   design as we anticipated cardiac surgery today. His antibiotic regimen
   has been switched to nafcillin 2 gm Q 4 hours and PO Vancomycin250mg po
   Q6 hours.  Cardiac cath yesterday demonstrated moderate lesions in the
   OMB and Diag but no critical disease. He is awaiting MRI of the spine
   to rule out an epidural abscess and an MRI of the head in the coming
   days. BP has been stable at 120s/80s off pressors. WBC ct stable at
   11.4. INR is slowly rising to 1.6 likely due to sterilization of gut
   flora from prolonged antibiotic therapy. Plan is to the OR tomorrow for
   AVR and MVR with debridement of the epidural abscess seen along the
   posterior mitral annulus on TEE. There is a stable PR interval. The
   patient's wife is aware of the patient
s condition.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and severe mitral regurgitation due to mitral valve vegetations. He has neurological deficits and is currently intubated and ventilated. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed moderate lesions in the OMB and Diag but no critical disease. He is awaiting an MRI of the spine to rule out an epidural abscess and an MRI of the head in the coming days. The patient's blood pressure has been stable at 120s/80s off pressors, and his WBC count is stable at 11.4. INR is slowly rising to 1.6 likely due to sterilization of gut flora from prolonged antibiotic therapy. The plan is to take the patient to the operating room tomorrow for an AVR (aortic valve replacement) and MVR (mitral valve repair) with debridement of the epidural abscess seen along the posterior mitral annulus on TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram). There is a stable PR interval. The patient's wife is aware of the patient's condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient had a history of sepsis caused by staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, which can lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Neurological deficits: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has been admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (community-acquired), ineffective coping, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, impaired skin integrity, knowledge deficit, and bacterial endocarditis. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed no significant stenosis requiring intervention. His central aortic pressures were within normal limits. He has been receiving various antibiotics, including cefepime, metronidazole, vancomycin, and nafcillin. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and is receiving midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 92-136 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86-124 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 9-22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 97%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,634 mL and output of 2,810 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,176 mL. His respiratory support consists of assisted mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 12 cmH2O, respiratory system compliance of 78.6 cmH2"

   # Mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis/ Sepsis [**3-21**]
   staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: BCx grew out MSSA, c/x neg since
   [**1-17**].  ECHO shows large vegetation on mitral valve, possible small
   vegetation on aortic valve.  Surgery is essential for recovery and
   after great disucussion within the primary team, the risks outweight
   the benefits.  Risk of hemorrhagic conversion is thought to be
   significantly reduced after the first three days.  Pt already has
   multiple reasons for urgent valve repair and has been preopoeratively
   optimized.
   - continue daily surveillance cultures: last positive cx on [**1-17**].
   Stop daily surveillance cultures.  Culture if spikes >101.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 10242**] had a stable night and remains intubated and ventilated by
   design as we anticipated cardiac surgery today. His antibiotic regimen
   has been switched to nafcillin 2 gm Q 4 hours and PO Vancomycin250mg po
   Q6 hours.  Cardiac cath yesterday demonstrated moderate lesions in the
   OMB and Diag but no critical disease. He is awaiting MRI of the spine
   to rule out an epidural abscess and an MRI of the head in the coming
   days. BP has been stable at 120s/80s off pressors. WBC ct stable at
   11.4. INR is slowly rising to 1.6 likely due to sterilization of gut
   flora from prolonged antibiotic therapy. Plan is to the OR tomorrow for
   AVR and MVR with debridement of the epidural abscess seen along the
   posterior mitral annulus on TEE. There is a stable PR interval. The
   patient's wife is aware of the patient
s condition.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","The patient's condition remains stable, with improvements in neurological deficits and delirium. The patient is awaiting cardiac surgery for valve repair and is also being evaluated for a possible epidural abscess. The patient's antibiotic regimen has been adjusted to include nafcillin and vancomycin. The INR is slowly rising due to prolonged antibiotic therapy. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and the WBC count is within normal range. The plan is to proceed with open-heart surgery tomorrow for the replacement of the aortic and mitral valves, along with debridement of the epidural abscess seen along the posterior mitral annulus on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)."

   # Mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis/ Sepsis [**3-21**]
   staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: BCx grew out MSSA, c/x neg since
   [**1-17**].  ECHO shows large vegetation on mitral valve, possible small
   vegetation on aortic valve.  Surgery is essential for recovery and
   after great disucussion within the primary team, the risks outweight
   the benefits.  Risk of hemorrhagic conversion is thought to be
   significantly reduced after the first three days.  Pt already has
   multiple reasons for urgent valve repair and has been preopoeratively
   optimized.

   on:[**2113-1-25**] 13:02 ------
","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of severe mitral regurgitation due to staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.
- The patient had a cardiac catheterization which showed no area requiring acute intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting.
- The patient's antibiotic regimen has been adjusted to nafcillin and vancomycin.
- The patient is awaiting MRI of the spine and head to rule out an epidural abscess.
- The patient's blood pressure has been stable, and white blood cell count is stable at 11.4.
- The patient's INR is slowly rising to 1.6, likely due to prolonged antibiotic therapy.
- The patient is planned for open-heart surgery tomorrow for aortic valve replacement and mitral valve repair with debridement of the epidural abscess.
- The patient's PR interval is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension previously, which may recur during surgery or due to low cardiac output.
2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of renal infarcts and recent gentamicin use, which could contribute to acute renal failure.
3. Delirium: The patient had episodes of agitation and delirium, which may reoccur during the perioperative period.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient is still intubated and ventilated by design, and there is a risk of respiratory distress post-surgery.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of severe mitral regurgitation and may experience cardiac complications during surgery or afterward.
6. Infection: Although C. difficile toxin test was negative, the patient has loose stools, and there is a risk of developing an infection due to prolonged antibiotic use.
7. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, and there is a risk of hemorrhagic conversion during or after surgery.
8. Neurological deficits: The patient has ongoing neurological deficits, and there is a risk of further neurological complications during surgery or afterward.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis, severe mitral regurgitation, and neurological deficits. He has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

2. The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization, which showed no areas requiring acute intervention and no need for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

3. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including cefepime, metronidazole, vancomycin, and nafcillin. The latest dose of antibiotics was administered on 01/25/2113.

4. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate 104 bpm, blood pressure 118/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97%.

5. The patient has been receiving infusions of midazolam (versed) and fentanyl. Other medications include pantoprazole (protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), ipratroprium, albuterol, nafcillin, thiamine, furosemide, mucomyst, acetaminophen, heparin, vancomycin orally, simethicone, docusate, protonix 40 mg IV, folic acid, senna/docusate, and others.

6. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.6 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 140 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 3.7 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 106 mg/dL, calcium (Ca++) of 7.4 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 1.6 mg/dL, and phosphorus (PO4) of 3.5 mg/dL. The platelet count is 420,000/mm³.

7. The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows an increase in bilateral linear opacities in the middle and right regions of the lung. Cardiac catheterization revealed a right dominant system with single-vessel CAD and 50% mid-vessel stenosis in the right coronary artery (RCA).

8. The patient's medical complications include sepsis, neurological deficits, delirium, respiratory distress, acute kidney injury (ARF), olecranon bursitis, hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and coronary artery disease (CAD).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of severe mitral regurgitation due to staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. He also has neurological deficits and is currently in the ICU for sepsis. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed no significant blockages requiring intervention. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including nafcillin, vancomycin, and cefepime. The patient's WBC count has improved from 20 to 13.2, indicating a response to treatment. However, the patient still has loose stools, which are not caused by Clostridium difficile infection. His neurological deficits continue to improve, and he has shown some agitation requiring antipsychotic medication. The patient's renal function has improved, allowing for increased dosing of cefepime. He is currently intubated for respiratory distress and is on multiple medications to maintain blood pressure and cardiac output. The patient's recent lab results show normal central aortic pressures, and his coronary angiography revealed a single-vessel CAD with 50% mid-vessel stenosis in the RCA. The patient's nutritional status is poor, and he is being started on tube feeds. A cardiac surgery consultation has been requested for possible valve repair or bypass. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is currently intubated, indicating severe respiratory distress. There is a risk of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a diagnosis of severe mitral regurgitation due to staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. The patient has neurological deficits and sepsis. The patient's condition requires urgent surgical intervention for valve repair, which will be performed today.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic conversion of infarcts: The patient has multiple evolving infarcts on CTA, but without hemorrhagic conversion. The risk of hemorrhagic conversion is significantly reduced after the first three days.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, most likely due to cardiac failure caused by severe mitral regurgitation. The patient has shown improvement with milrinone and levophed.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated and have worsened in the setting of hypotension. Prerenal etiology is expected to improve with milrinone and improved forward flow.

4. Respiratory distress: The patient is intubated and requires continued monitoring and treatment for respiratory distress.

5. Delirium: The patient was previously agitated and required Haldol and Ativan for sedation. The patient is currently calm with standing Haldol.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 M found to have staphlyococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis with
   severe mitral regurgitation [**3-21**] mitral valve vegetations and flail
   leaflet, course c/b sepsis, neurological deficits.
   # Mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis/ Sepsis [**3-21**]
   staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: BCx grew out MSSA, c/x neg since
   [**1-17**].  ECHO shows large vegetation on mitral valve, possible small
   vegetation on aortic valve.  Surgery is essential for recovery and
   after great disucussion within the primary team, the risks outweight
   the benefits.  Risk of hemorrhagic conversion is thought to be
   significantly reduced after the first three days.  Pt already has
   multiple reasons for urgent valve repair and has been preopoeratively
   optimized.
   - OR today
   - surveillance cultures: last positive cx on [**1-17**].   Stop daily
   surveillance cultures.  Culture if spikes >101.
   - f/u cardiac surgery recs

 Continue Nafcillin
   - cath - no coronary intervention needed
   - daily ECG to eval for heart block
   - MRI spine shows no abscess
   #Fever
 Pt spiked to 103.  Most likely it is his abscess on the Mitral
   valve that causes intermittent temperature.    He has been pan-cultured
   with each spike in his temperature which shows no growth.  His CXR is
   consistent with pulmonary edema.
   -          surgery for removal of abscess
   #Hypotension - most likely due to cardiac failure due to severe MR.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis involving the mitral valve, resulting in severe mitral regurgitation and flail leaflet. The patient also has neurological deficits, fever, hypotension, loose stools (negative for Clostridioides difficile), respiratory distress requiring intubation, acute renal failure, olecranon bursitis, hypoalbuminemia, and a history of heavy smoking.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hemorrhagic conversion of infarcts: The patient has a history of multiple evolving infarcts on the computed tomography angiography (CTA), but no hemorrhagic conversion. However, there is a risk of hemorrhagic conversion if the patient undergoes surgery or develops severe coagulopathy.

2. Mitral valve surgery complications: The patient is planned for surgery to repair the damaged mitral valve. Surgical interventions carry risks such as bleeding, infection, heart block, and stroke.

3. Neurological deterioration: The patient has marked syringohydromyelia extending from the fourth ventricle to the T8-9 level, which may lead to further neurological deficits if not managed appropriately.

4. Sepsis: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient continues to have intermittent temperatures, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Sepsis can develop if the infection spreads"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 10242**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4607**] a temp to [**Age over 90 **] yesterday afternoon with no temps
   since. MRI of the spine and CT I+ of the head all showed no abscess,
   source of infection and no mycotic aneurysm. Both Neurosurgery,
   Neurology and ID feel the patient should undergo double valve
   replacement with intracardiac abscess debridement as soon as possible.
   I have conveyed this to Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] of c-[**Doctor First Name 91**]. WBC count continues to
   decline from 11.4 to 10.8 today on Nafcillin 2 g Q4 hrs and PO Vanco.
   He is on low dose Milrinone and low dose levo and the plan is to wean
   the levo off this am and send him to the OR on low dose milrinone later
   today.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 568**] and Pride..
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis and severe mitral regurgitation. The patient has neurological deficits and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Fever: The patient had a fever of 103°F, which was likely due to the abscess on the mitral valve. The fever subsided after antibiotics were started.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which was likely caused by cardiac failure due to severe MR. The patient showed improvement with milrinone.
3. Loose stools: The patient had loose stools since admission. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) was negative three times, and empirically, he was treated with PO Vanc.
4. Neurological deficits: The patient has ongoing neurological deficits that continue to improve.
5. Respiratory distress: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.
6. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels were stable at 1.5 mg/dL, with a baseline of 0.4 mg/dL. This indicates acute renal failure, which is expected to improve with improved forward flow from the use of milrinone.
7. Olecranon bursitis: The patient had olecranon bursitis, which was washed out and showed no evidence of infection.

   Imaging: CXR: Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Increased opacities in the
   perihilar regions and
   lower lobes bilaterally, a combination with a stable mild pulmonary
   edema,
   small bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe retrocardiac
   atelectasis. NG tube tip is in the stomach. ET tube, left subclavian
   catheter remain in place. Patient has known severe emphysema.
   Microbiology: BCx negative since [**1-20**]
   Assessment and Plan
   49 M found to have staphlyococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis with
   severe mitral regurgitation [**3-21**] mitral valve vegetations and flail
   leaflet, course c/b sepsis, neurological deficits.
   # Mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis/ Sepsis [**3-21**]
   staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: BCx grew out MSSA, c/x neg since
   [**1-17**].  ECHO shows large vegetation on mitral valve, possible small
   vegetation on aortic valve.  Surgery is essential for recovery and
   after great disucussion within the primary team, the risks outweight
   the benefits.  Risk of hemorrhagic conversion is thought to be
   significantly reduced after the first three days.  Pt already has
   multiple reasons for urgent valve repair, including valvular abscess.
   He has been preopoeratively optimized.
   - OR today
   - surveillance cultures: last positive cx on [**1-17**].   Stop daily
   surveillance cultures.  Culture if spikes >101.
   - f/u cardiac surgery recs
   - f/u ID recs
 Continue Nafcillin , go for surgery
   - s/p OR for tooth extraction
   - cath - no coronary intervention needed
   - daily ECG to eval for heart block
   - MRI spine shows no abscess
   #Fever
 Pt spiked to 103 two days ago.  Most likely due to valvuar
   abscess causing intermittent temperature.    He has been pan-cultured
   with each spike in his temperature which shows no growth.  His CXR is
   consistent with pulmonary edema.
   -          surgery for removal of abscess
   #Hypotension - most likely due to cardiac failure due to severe MR.
   [**Name13 (STitle) 6**] had significant improvement with milrinone.
   - continue milrinone
   - levophed has been discontinued.
    # Loose stools: Pt has been having loose stools since admission. Cdiff
   negative x3. WBC improved from 20 to 13.2.
   - responding to po vanco, has not had BM for 2 days, would d/c po
   vanco.
   - add banana flakes to tube feeds
   # Neurological deficits
 Neurological deficits continue to improve,
   though now difficult to assess given sedation.  Neurological exam:
   PERRL, CN2-12 intact.  moves all extremities, upper extremity strength
   intact.  Lower extremity strength difficult to assess. Right side
   weaker than left.
   - MRI  head, optic nerves, and spine once patient stabilized. (after
   surgery)
   - repeat CT angio head/neck- no mycotic aneurysm
   - final treatment would be surgery
   - neurology and neurosurg following.
   # Delirium
 Pt agitated [**1-21**], requiring Haldol 19mg IV and Ativan 1mg
   IV. Appropriate and calm on [**1-22**] with standing Haldol.
   - if needed, haldol and ativan; monitor for QTc prolongation, EPS,
   akithesia, dystonia, TD, and NMS
    # Respiratory Distress
 Intubated
   - will require diuresis post OR
   #ARF - creatinine stable -  1.5 today (baseline 0.4). Had improved to
   0.9 from peak of mid 2s.  Now worsening in setting of hypotension.
   Prerenal etiology expected to improve with milrinone and improved
   forward flow.
   -Continue to monitor UOP, Cr
   - renally dose all meds
    # Olecranon bursistis s/p washout
 no evidence of infection as per OR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of severe emphysema, who was admitted with staphylococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis and severe mitral regurgitation. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including antibiotics, cardiac surgery recommendations, and imaging studies.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Fever: The patient spiked to 103 degrees two days ago, most likely due to a valvular abscess causing intermittent temperature. He has been pancultured with each spike in temperature, showing no growth. His chest X-ray is consistent with pulmonary edema.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is most likely due to cardiac failure caused by severe mitral regurgitation. The patient has shown significant improvement with milrinone.

3. Loose stools: The patient has been experiencing loose stools since admission. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ruled out three times. The patient is responding well to oral vancomycin, and his white blood cell count has improved.

4. Neurological deficits: The patient's neurological deficits continue to improve, although they are difficult to assess given sedation. The patient's upper extremity strength is intact, but lower extremity strength is difficult to assess.

5. Delirium: The patient was agitated on January 21st and required haloperidol and lorazepam"

   Other labs: PT / PTT / INR:14.8/31.3/1.3, Ca++:7.5 mg/dL, Mg++:2.3
   mg/dL, PO4:3.9 mg/dL
   Imaging: CXR: Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Increased opacities in the
   perihilar regions and
   lower lobes bilaterally, a combination with a stable mild pulmonary
   edema,
   small bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe retrocardiac
   atelectasis. NG tube tip is in the stomach. ET tube, left subclavian
   catheter remain in place. Patient has known severe emphysema.
   Microbiology: BCx negative since [**1-20**]
   Assessment and Plan
   49 M found to have staphlyococcus aureus bacterial endocarditis with
   severe mitral regurgitation [**3-21**] mitral valve vegetations and flail
   leaflet, course c/b sepsis, neurological deficits.
   # Mitral valve staphylococcus aureus endocarditis/ Sepsis [**3-21**]
   staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: BCx grew out MSSA, c/x neg since
   [**1-17**].  ECHO shows large vegetation on mitral valve, possible small
   vegetation on aortic valve.  Surgery is essential for recovery and
   after great disucussion within the primary team, the risks outweight
   the benefits.  Risk of hemorrhagic conversion is thought to be
   significantly reduced after the first three days.  Pt already has
   multiple reasons for urgent valve repair, including valvular abscess.
   He has been preopoeratively optimized.
   - OR today
   - surveillance cultures: last positive cx on [**1-17**].   Stop daily
   surveillance cultures.  Culture if spikes >101.
   - f/u cardiac surgery recs
   - f/u ID recs
 Continue Nafcillin , go for surgery
   - s/p OR for tooth extraction
   - cath - no coronary intervention needed
   - daily ECG to eval for heart block
   - MRI spine shows no abscess
   #Fever
 Pt spiked to 103 two days ago.  Most likely due to valvuar
   abscess causing intermittent temperature.    He has been pan-cultured
   with each spike in his temperature which shows no growth.  His CXR is
   consistent with pulmonary edema.
   -          surgery for removal of abscess
   #Hypotension - most likely due to cardiac failure due to severe MR.
   [**Name13 (STitle) 6**] had significant improvement with milrinone.
   - continue milrinone
   - levophed has been discontinued.
    # Loose stools: Pt has been having loose stools since admission. Cdiff
   negative x3. WBC improved from 20 to 13.2.
   - responding to po vanco, has not had BM for 2 days, would d/c po
   vanco.
   - add banana flakes to tube feeds
   # Neurological deficits
 Neurological deficits continue to improve,
   though now difficult to assess given sedation.  Neurological exam:
   PERRL, CN2-12 intact.  moves all extremities, upper extremity strength
   intact.  Lower extremity strength difficult to assess. Right side
   weaker than left.
   - MRI  head, optic nerves, and spine once patient stabilized. (after
   surgery)
   - repeat CT angio head/neck- no mycotic aneurysm
   - final treatment would be surgery
   - neurology and neurosurg following.
   # Delirium
 Pt agitated [**1-21**], requiring Haldol 19mg IV and Ativan 1mg
   IV. Appropriate and calm on [**1-22**] with standing Haldol.
   - if needed, haldol and ativan; monitor for QTc prolongation, EPS,
   akithesia, dystonia, TD, and NMS
    # Respiratory Distress
 Intubated
   - will require diuresis post OR
   #ARF - creatinine stable -  1.5 today (baseline 0.4). Had improved to
   0.9 from peak of mid 2s.  Now worsening in setting of hypotension.
   Prerenal etiology expected to improve with milrinone and improved
   forward flow.
   -Continue to monitor UOP, Cr
   - renally dose all meds
    # Olecranon bursistis s/p washout
 no evidence of infection as per OR
   report and initial gram stain.
   - f/u fluid cx - negative
   #Hypoalbuminemia
 poor nutrition.  Dobhoff placed [**1-22**], Tube feeds
   started.
   - NPO currently due to surgery today
   # CORONARIES: no known CAD but heavy smoker, coronaries clean
   # PUMP: Bedside ECHO done [**1-16**]. EF 55-60%.
