   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 78 kg overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with an unclear chief complaint. They have been experiencing delirium and are immunocompromised. The patient has undergone various tests and procedures, including an EEG, LP, IVIG administration, TSH and thyroid antibody testing, C. diff testing, and US for the left upper extremity and femoral artery. They are currently on multiple medications, including heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological complications: The patient's initial EEG did not show any evidence of seizure, but they will be getting a 24-hour EEG. There is also a recommendation for further characterization of the left common femoral pathology, which could potentially be related to external compression, stenosis, or occlusion.

2. Infection: The patient's LP did not show signs of infection, but there is a need to follow up with HSV-PCR. There is also a mention of preliminary results for fluid culture, fungal culture, and viral culture from CSF, but no conclusive findings are mentioned.

3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is low, and they have an occluded graft to the right saphenous vein. Additionally, there is no variability in flow in the left common femoral artery, suggesting upstream pathology.

4. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen with a target SpO2 of 95%. There are also wheez"

   -          Continue Spiriva, Advair, Albuterol PRN
   -          Consider CTA chest given A-a gradient and history of UE DVT
   Leukocytosis:  WBC 20K for past two days, elevated from baseline of
   6-9K.  Patient did originally present with abdominal pain and colitis;
   however, these symptoms have resolved in the interval course of her
   hospitalization.  New elevation of WBC suggests nosocomial infection.
   Cdiff toxin negative x 1 this admission, but this sample predates
   leukocytosis.  LLL infiltrate on CXR suggestive of aspiration
   pneumonitis vs HAP (although infiltrate has resolved on repeat CXR this
   AM).
   -          pan-culture
   -          send stool studies, including repeat c. diff toxin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, obstructive lung disease, and sleep apnea. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, described as delirium. The differential diagnosis includes hypoxemia, infection, medication effects, uremia, subclinical seizure activity, and benzodiazepine withdrawal.

The patient's leukocyte count has increased to 20,000/mm3 over the past two days, indicating a possible nosocomial infection. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but her mental status has worsened. She also has a history of abdominal pain and colitis, although these symptoms have resolved during her hospitalization. A sample for Clostridium difficile toxin was negative, but a repeat test is pending.

The patient has a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is contributing to her baseline hypoxia and hypercarbia. BiPAP therapy has been continued, and a sleep study has been performed to evaluate her OSA.

She has an upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a partial superior vena cava (SVC) occlusion. She is not currently anticoagulated for these conditions.

The patient's renal function is compromised due to ESRD, which is secondary to IgA nephropathy and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, obstructive lung disease, and sleep apnea. She was transferred back to the ICU with altered mental status, known as delirium. The differential diagnosis for her altered mental status includes hypoxemia, infection, medication effects, uremia, subclinical seizure activity, and benzodiazepine withdrawal. Her leukocyte count has risen to 20,000, indicating a possible nosocomial infection. She has been empirically anticoagulated for a possible pulmonary embolism (PE) due to a known upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and an A-a gradient. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple factors, including potential infections, respiratory issues, renal failure, and cardiovascular problems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial infection: The patient's elevated leukocyte count suggests a new infection acquired during her hospitalization. Further investigations are needed to identify the source and appropriate treatment.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has an upper extremity DVT and an A-a gradient, which increases the suspicion for PE. Empirical anticoagulation has been initiated, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest is planned.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 22-year-old female with Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
- The patient presented with altered mental status (AMS), which is suspected to be delirium.
- The patient has leukocytosis and is being treated with antibiotics.
- There is concern for hypoxia/hypercarbia due to COPD and potential pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
- The patient is currently on continuous hemodialysis (HD).
- The patient's code status is full code.
- The patient is in the ICU and receiving various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AMS/Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could progress to severe confusion, agitation, or even coma if not properly managed.
2. Infection: With leukocytosis and ongoing antibiotic treatment, there is a risk of infection spreading or developing further complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's impaired gas exchange and hypoxemia may lead to respiratory failure if not adequately supported with BiPAP or mechanical ventilation.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: Given the patient's hypoxia and hypercarbia, there is a concern for a possible PE, which can be life-threatening if not promptly diagnosed and"

   22 year old female with CIVD, ESRD, COPD (from CIVD) who returns to the

   Reviewed Head CT with radiologist to help discern the etiology of white

   Plan:
   1)       Given concerning CT scan results, will get MRI of the head
   yesterday respiratory status was too tenuous to consider without
   intubation but given improvement, I believe it is worth attempting
   without intubation first.  Will also need to do without Gad at first
   given the ESRD.  Can consider gad if we need too if study without is
   not definitive
   2)       Continue Broad-spectrum antibiotics incuding flagyl for
   potential anaerobes
   3)       Check CT scan of the chest to R/O PE
 if negative, will
   discontinue heparin
   4)       Follow respiratory status closely
   Time: 30 minutes

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU due to acute mental status changes and worsening respiratory status. Overnight, there was marginal improvement in mental status and significant improvement in respiratory status. The patient is currently on baseline 3 liters of oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mental status changes: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to delirium or a brain abscess, as suggested by the white matter hypodensities seen on the head CT scan.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxemia, which may be related to her underlying COPD or possibly a pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. CVID: The patient has CVID, which makes her more susceptible to infections.
4. ESRD: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis (HD).
5. COPD: The patient has COPD, which may contribute to her respiratory difficulties.
6. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC): There is a possibility of SVC due to the presence of multiple IV lines.
7. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has OSA, which can worsen her respiratory status.
8. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage"

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, obstructive lung disease, and sleep apnea. She was transferred back to the ICU with altered mental status. The differential diagnosis for her delirium includes hypoxemia, infection, medication effects, uremia, subclinical seizure activity, and benzodiazepine withdrawal. She has leukocytosis and a hypodense area on MRI brain, which could be an abscess or an old infarct. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, acyclovir, and continuous EEG monitoring. Neurology and Psych consults have been ordered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has baseline hypoxia and hypercarbia due to obstructive lung disease, as well as severe obstructive sleep apnea. This can lead to further respiratory distress.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count suggests a nosocomial infection, possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) given the left lower lobe consolidation on CT chest.
3. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis due to secondary IgA nephropathy and multiple episodes of pyelonephritis. There may be concerns about fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT):"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including altered mental status, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, colitis, respiratory failure, psychiatric disease, superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), renal failure, asthma, abdominal pain, and a history of hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on various medications such as vancomycin, meropenem, acyclovir, and metronidazole. Imaging studies show no large central pulmonary embolism (PE) but reveal new left lower lobe consolidation, improved but persistent right middle lobe infectious airspace opacities, and improvement in infectious appearing fat stranding around the cecum/proximal colon. An MRI of the head is pending. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he is still delirious and has impaired respiratory function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the CT angiogram (CTA) did not reveal any large central PE, there is still a possibility of smaller emboli that may not have been detected. If left untreated, PE can lead to respiratory failure and even death.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of new left lower lobe consolidation on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of CVID, ESRD on HD, obstructive lung disease, and sleep apnea. She was transferred back to the ICU with altered mental status, and her condition has been worsening despite the initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 100/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently receiving BiPAP support and has been empirically anticoagulated for a possible pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and waxing and waning course suggest delirium. The differential diagnosis includes hypoxemia, infection, medication effects, uremia, subclinical seizure activity, and benzodiazepine withdrawal.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has risen to 20,000 cells/µL, indicating a possible nosocomial infection. The previous resolution of abdominal pain and colitis suggests that the current leukocytosis may be due to a new infection.
3. Hypoxia: The patient has baseline hypoxia and hypercarbia secondary to obstructive lung disease. Given the known upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and A-a gradient,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, obstructive lung disease, and sleep apnea. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and has since developed leukocytosis, hypodense area on MRI brain, and new left lower lobe consolidation. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, antivirals, and receiving IVIG. She has multiple medical complications including hypoxia, leukocytosis, ESRD, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypotension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), asthma, and mental illness. The patient is also on prophylactic medications for DVT and stress ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has baseline hypoxia and hypercarbia due to obstructive lung disease and severe OSA. Continuous BiPAP support is recommended, and further evaluation of HAP is necessary.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count rose to 20K, suggesting a nosocomial infection. C.diff toxin is negative, but a repeat test should be done. The LLL infiltrate on CT chest indicates possible HAP. Empiric coverage for c. diff should be continued, and cultures should be followed up.
3. ESRD:"

","Based on the provided information, the patient has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to delirium. The cause of the delirium is unclear, and further evaluation is needed.

2. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient has impaired respiration and gas exchange, indicating chronic respiratory failure. This could be related to underlying conditions such as COPD with LLL PNA.

3. Colitis, Other (Not C. Diff): The patient has an altered bowel movement pattern, which suggests colitis. However, it is not caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

4. Psychiatric Disease, Other (Including Schizophrenia, Personality Disorders): The patient has a history of psychiatric disease, but the specific diagnoses are unclear. It is also unclear if any psychiatric medications should be reintroduced.

5. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC): The patient may have SVC syndrome, which is characterized by symptoms such as shortness of breath, facial swelling, and upper extremity swelling.

6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, suggesting the possibility of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU due to acute mental status changes and worsening respiratory status. The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.5°C, pulse rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

The patient's mental status has shown marginal improvement overnight, but she remains confused. Her respiratory status has also improved significantly, currently requiring only 3 liters of supplemental oxygen. The physical examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally, with no evidence of central pulmonary embolism or pelvic deep vein thrombosis. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination shows no focal neurologic findings, and lumbar puncture results are negative.

The patient has several medical complications, including delirium, respiratory failure, colitis (not Clostridium difficile), superior vena cava syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, renal failure, asthma, and abdominal pain. 

Plan:
1. The psychiatrist will evaluate whether to continue psychiatric medications.
2. Continue using bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of common variable immune deficiency (CVID), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), obstructive lung disease, and sleep apnea. She was transferred back to the ICU with altered mental status, presenting with delirium. The differential diagnosis includes hypoxemia, infection, medication effects, uremia, subclinical seizure activity, and benzodiazepine withdrawal. The patient also has leukocytosis, a hypodense area on MRI brain (possibly abscess or old infarct), and a baseline hypoxia and hypercarbia due to obstructive lung disease. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and meropenem, continuous EEG monitoring, and awaiting results of HSV PCR. The patient's other medical conditions include severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), asthma, CVID, ESRD, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests a nosocomial infection, particularly given the resolution of initial symptoms and the presence of an LLL infiltrate on CT chest, which may indicate hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) Colitis: Although the patient's C. diff toxin test is negative, the possibility of C. diff should still"

","The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), obstructive lung disease, and sleep apnea. She was transferred back to the ICU with altered mental status, characterized by delirium with a waxing and waning course. The differential diagnosis includes hypoxemia, infection, medication effects, uremia, subclinical seizure activity, and benzodiazepine withdrawal.

The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 20,000 cells/mm3, which is elevated from her baseline of 6-9,000 cells/mm3. This suggests a nosocomial infection, especially considering her previous symptoms of abdominal pain and colitis have resolved. However, C. difficile toxin testing has been negative twice since the development of leukocytosis. A lung infiltrate on CT chest indicates Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP), for which she is receiving appropriate antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and meropenem.

Other notable findings include hypoxia due to obstructive lung disease and severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), ESRD secondary to IgA nephropathy and pyelonephritis, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with partial superior vena cava (SVC) occlusion, hypotension requiring fludrocortisone and mid"

   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow and agree with the
   assessment and plan as outlined 22 year old female with CIVD, ESRD,
   COPD (from CIVD) who returns to the ICU because of acute mental status
   changes and worsening respiratory status.
   Overnight, marginal improvement in mental status and much improvement
   in respiratory status (currently on baseline 3 liters of oxygen).
   On exam, T 36.7   P 66   BP 105/33  RR 20  Sat 95%
   Gen: Awake, alert and conversant
   Chest: CTA bilaterally
   Heart: S1 S2 reg
   Abd: Soft NT ND
   Neuro: alert and oriented.  No focal neuro findings
   MRI had showed what appears to be old cortical infarctions but no acute
   findings.  LP negative.
   A:
   1)       Mental Status Changes
 resolved at this time
   2)       Hypoxia
 improved to baseline
   3)       CVID
   4)       ESRD
   Plan:
   1)       Psych attending to see to determine what psych meds to
   re-start
 saw patient and wants to hold off any meds for now
 will
   re-evaluate again tomorrow
   2)       Continue bipap at night as per her standard regimen
   3)       Continue to follow all of her cultures
   4)       At this point it is unclear what caused the significantly
   altered mental status but she is much improved and appears at baseline
 will be able to send to the floor today.
