   subsequent day.  Pt

   would have low threshold for placing a central line, however overall
   seems to be clinically improving

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of recently diagnosed inoperable pancreatic cancer metastatic to the liver. She presented with fevers, increased WBC, RUQ pain, and jaundice. A CT scan of the abdomen showed significant enlargement of the CBD and intrahepatic biliary tree. 

The patient has been diagnosed with cholangitis, as indicated by Charcot's triad of increased WBC, fever, and RUQ pain. Her lactate level was normal, and she was never hypotensive in the ED. The patient has also been diagnosed with anemia, decreased significantly overnight but at baseline from most recent admission. 

She is currently receiving vancomycin and Zosyn for sepsis, ursodiol for pancreatic cancer, ranitidine and omeprazole for GERD, and nicotine patches for nicotine abuse. The patient's pain is being controlled with a fentanyl patch and IV dilaudid as needed. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/57 mmHg to 91/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of the patient's condition due to ongoing sepsis, development of additional infections such"

   2)Cholangitis-Concerning for possible obstruction from pancreatic head
   mass although stent did appear to be in place and patent on the CT
   scan.  Combination of pain, jaundice, fever is however quite consistent
   with biliary source of acute sepsis.  Has had improved AP,
   Transaminases overnight as well.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of recently diagnosed inoperable pancreatic cancer metastatic to the liver. She presented with fevers, increased white blood cell count, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and was found to have significant enlargement of the common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary tree on CT of the abdomen. She was diagnosed with cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure, where an old 80 metal stent had migrated and was impacted against the wall of the duodenum. The stent was replaced with a new one, and purulent material was drained out. The patient started on clear liquids and is currently being monitored in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient's presentation of fevers, increased WBC, RUQ pain, and jaundice along with the CT findings suggest cholangitis. This condition can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not promptly treated.
2. Pancreatic cancer with metastatic liver disease: The patient has a history of inoperable pancreatic cancer with metastasis to the liver. This can lead to complications such as liver dysfunction, biliary obstruction, and pain.
3. Septic shock: The patient had a previous episode of septic shock due to enterococcal cholangitis. There is a risk of recurrence if the infection is not effectively controlled.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of recently diagnosed inoperable pancreatic cancer metastatic to the liver. She presented with fevers, increased white blood cell count, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice, along with a CT scan showing significant enlargement of the common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary tree.

The patient has been diagnosed with cholangitis, as indicated by Charcot's triad of increased white blood cell count, fever, and right upper quadrant pain. She also has liver metastases from pancreatic cancer.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient underwent an ERCP procedure where an old stent had migrated and was impacted against the wall of the duodenum. A new stent was placed, and pus was drained out. The patient was on peripheral neo during the ERCP but was taken off before returning to the ICU.

The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 80s and responded to fluid administration. She started on clear liquids and refused to have lab draws done. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/66 mmHg to 150/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

   metastatic to the liver s/p recent ERCP and placement of metal [**Year (4 digits) 80**]
   for enterococcal cholangitis complicated by septic shock who presents
   with fevers, increased WBC, RUQ pain, and jaundice along with a CT of
   the abdomen showing significant enlargement of CBD and intrahepatic
   biliary tree.
   .
   # Cholangitis: Pt + for charcot's triad increased WBC, fever, and RUQ
   pain on admission. Her lactate was normal and she was never hypotensive
   in the ED.  In ED there is concern for possible cholangitis.  On exam

","The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of recently diagnosed inoperable pancreatic cancer metastatic to the liver. She presented with fevers, increased white blood cell count, RUQ pain, and jaundice. Her CT scan showed significant enlargement of the common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary tree. She had an ERCP done and an old stent migrated and was impacted against the wall of the duodenum. A new stent was placed, and pus was drained out. She is currently on clear liquids and refusing blood draws. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 124/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She has mild edema in both hands and ankles. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 23.5, normal hemoglobin and platelet count, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The patient's assessment includes cholangitis, pancreatic cancer, GERD, nicotine abuse, anemia, and edema. The plan includes continuing vancomycin and Zosyn, following bilirubin levels, monitoring heart rate and blood pressure, and providing pain control with fentanyl patch and IV dilaudid as needed. She also has a PICC line in place, and her code status is full code."
