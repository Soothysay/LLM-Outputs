","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of ovarian cancer, who underwent surgery to correct small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to ovarian metastasis. During the procedure, she experienced hypoxemia and hypotension and received blood products. Post-operatively, she developed refractory hypoxemia and was intubated, paralyzed, and placed in the prone position. She requires invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen central venous line. The patient is receiving multiple pressors, antibiotics, bicarbonate, albumin, and IV fluids. She has a code status of DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's refractory hypoxemia and need for invasive ventilation indicate the possibility of respiratory failure. This could be due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), noninfectious causes, aspiration, or vascular leak from tumor manipulation.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of AKI, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension and hypoxemia. Further evaluation with renal ultrasound to rule out any obstruction as a complication of surgery is recommended.
3. Infection: Despite receiving antibiotics, the patient's condition may be complicated by an infection. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are necessary to prevent and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of ovarian cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for surgery to correct small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to ovarian metastasis. The patient underwent an emergent procedure and received blood products intraoperatively due to hypoxemia and hypotension. Post-operatively, the patient remains hypoxemic and requires invasive ventilation. The patient also requires multiple pressors, bicarb, albumin, and IV fluids. 

24-hour events include invasive ventilation started at 10:00 PM, EKG at 10:31 PM, multi-lumen started at 10:42 PM, arterial line started at 10:43 PM, and trans-thoracic echo at 11:31 PM. Overnight, the patient received antibiotics, pressors, bicarb, albumin, and IV fluids. 

Physical examination reveals an intubated, sedated, and prone patient. Lab results show low hemoglobin levels, elevated WBC count, decreased platelet count, high creatinine levels, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. Chest X-ray shows new bilateral widespread infiltrates compared to pre-op film, suggesting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, shock, and new infiltrates compatible with ARDS, suspecting noninfectious causes. The patient's ICU care involves nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. Various diagnostic tests and procedures were performed, including EKG, arterial line insertion, trans-thoracic echo, and multiple lab tests. The patient has a history of allergies to latex, cefazolin, red dye, cephalosporins, and nickel. They received multiple doses of antibiotics including vancomycin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem. The patient is currently receiving several infusions for pain management and sedation. Hemodynamic monitoring and fluid balance data indicate the patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a slight variation in blood pressure. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.29, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 36 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 91 mmHg. The patient's labs reveal leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.3 g/dL, elevated troponin T levels, elevated liver enzymes,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of ovarian cancer, who underwent surgery to correct small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to ovarian metastases. During the operation, she experienced hypoxemia and hypotension and received blood products. Post-operatively, she developed refractory hypoxemia and required invasive ventilation and prone positioning.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (HR: 123 bpm), hypotension (BP: 92/68 mmHg), and an increased respiratory rate (RR: 30 breaths/min). Her oxygen saturation is 96% on 100% FiO2. She is on multiple pressors and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis (pH: 7.29) with elevated carbon dioxide levels (PaCO2: 36 mmHg) and decreased oxygen levels (PaO2: 92 mmHg). Her white blood cell count is elevated at 497 K/uL.

Radiology images show new bilateral widespread infiltrates on chest X-ray compared to pre-operative film, suggesting the possibility of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's cardiac status is unable to be examined due to intubation.

Laboratory results reveal anemia (Hct: 40.9%), thrombocytopenia (Plt: 497 K/uL), elevated creatinine (Cr: 1.2 mg/dL), and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 97/187). Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for low potassium (K+: 3.5 mEq/L). Other lab values, including lactate, albumin, and cardiac markers, are also provided.

The patient's condition is complicated by refractory hypoxemia, shock, and new pulmonary infiltrates consistent with ARDS. Noninfectious causes such as aspiration and vascular leak from tumor manipulation are suspected. The patient will continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, remain in the prone position, and have her blood pressure and pH monitored closely.

Furthermore, the patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension and hypoxemia. Renal ultrasound may be considered to rule out any obstruction as a complication of surgery.

The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she will continue to receive ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers."

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, post-operative ileostomy, and bowel perfusion surgery. She has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, shock, and refractory hypoxemia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/67 to 115/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been intubated and sedated, with clear lungs and good air movement. However, her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for improved urine output and somewhat improved oxygen needs. Allergies include latex, cefazolin, red dye, cephalosporins, nickel, and a rash. The patient has received multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and metronidazole.

Infusions include fentanyl, vasopressin, phenylephrine, midazolam, cisatracurium, norepinephrine, and famotidine. The patient also received heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications are unchanged from admission.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, slightly elevated platelet count of 407,"

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, post-operative ileostomy, and bowel perfusion surgery. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, shock, refractory hypoxemia, and acute kidney injury (ARF) due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension/hypoxemia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, receiving high-flow oxygen and vasopressors.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (HR: 113 bpm), hypotension (BP: 104/67 mmHg), increased respiratory rate (RR: 30 breaths/min), and fever (Tmax: 39.1°C). The patient's weight has increased from 63 kg at admission to 76 kg currently.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and metronidazole. She is also receiving IV fluids and various medications such as fentanyl, vasopressin, phenylephrine, midazolam, cisatracurium, and famotidine.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC: 11.5 K/uL), elevated troponin T level (<0.01 ng/mL), elevated lactate level (4.5 mm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, post-op ileostomy, and bowel perf surgery. She is currently intubated, sedated, and in the prone position in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing refractory hypoxemia and is suspected to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possibly due to aspiration or vascular leak from tumor manipulation. She is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute kidney injury (ARF) and various medications to manage her condition, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and corticosteroids. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with persistent fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's symptoms, such as refractory hypoxemia and new infiltrates on imaging, suggest the development of ARDS. This condition can progress to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Sepsis: Given the presence of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count, the patient may be at risk for sepsis. The source of infection could be related to the ileostomy or a hospital-acquired infection.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine and urea levels indicate possible AKI, which can be attributed to hypoperfusion or direct injury to the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic ovarian cancer, post-operative ileostomy, bowel perfusion surgery, and gynecological involvement. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, shock, refractory hypoxemia, and suspected noninfectious causes such as ARDS due to aspiration and vascular leak from tumor manipulation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.4°F (39.1°C), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/67 to 115/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, FiO2 of 80%, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O.

The patient has been on several medications, including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Meropenem, Metronidazole), sedatives (Fentanyl, Vasopressin, Phenylephrine, Midazolam), muscle relaxants (Cisatracurium), and other ICU medications (Famotidine, Heparin Sodium). She also has a history of allergies to latex, cefazolin, red dye, cephalosporins, nickel, and rashes associated with these allergens."

The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, obtaining a prone bed, continuing three pressors (levo, neo, vaso), targeting pH in high 7.2 and PaO2 > 70.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count has increased from 11.5 to 31.3, which could represent inflammation from cytokine release (tumor lysis syndrome or new infection). Pan cultures of stool, urine, blood, and sputum are planned.

3. Metastatic ovarian cancer, post-operative ileostomy, bowel perfusion: Follow-up surgery recommendations, follow-up gynecology recommendations, and a family meeting with the patient's husband, cousin, and gynecologic oncology team are planned.

4. Acute renal insufficiency: The patient likely has ATN in the setting of hypotension/hypoxemia during surgery. Renal U/S shows no evidence of ureteral obstruction or surgical complication. UOP has"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo F w/ metastatic ovarian CA s/p surgical resection who presents to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] w/ respiratory failure, shock, refractory hypoxemia w/ new
   infiltrates compatible ARDS likely due to noninfectious etiogies such
   as vascular leak/ cytokine release from tumour manipulation.
   1. ARDS- intubated on ARDS NET protocol. CXR much improved from
   yesterday. But stil w/ B/L fluffy infiltrates as compared to relatively
   clear pre-op CXR. ABGs improving in terms of oxygenation with
   paralysis.
   -- continue broad spectrum abx
   -- decrease solumedrol at 125mg q6h
 80mg q6h
   -- keep supine
   --  continue 3 pressors (levo, neo, vaso) target pH in high 7.3
s and
   PaO2 > 70
   -- attempt to wean pressors as tolerated
   -- continue paralysis w/ nimbex
   2. Leukocytosis- WBC bump to 31.3 from 11.5 which could represent
   inflammation from cytokine release ([**Last Name (LF) 11698**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]-1, IL-6) from tumour lysis
   or could represent new area of infection
   -- pan culture stool, urine, blood, sputum

s husband [**Name (NI) 653**], cousin, gyn onc team
 family seems
   to be moving t/w CMO ?
   -- t/b w/ palliative care?
   4. Acute Renal Insufficient
 likely due to ATN in setting of
   hypotension/hypoxemia during surgery, so fluids unlikely to alleviate.
   Renal U/S shows no evidence of ureteral obstruction or surgical
   complication. UOP has been excellent.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer who underwent surgical resection. She presented to the ICU with respiratory failure, shock, and refractory hypoxemia with new infiltrates compatible with ARDS likely due to noninfectious etiologies such as vascular leak/cytokine release from tumor manipulation.

The patient is currently intubated on an ARDS NET protocol, and her chest X-ray has improved compared to yesterday, although she still has bilateral fluffy infiltrates. Her ABGs are improving in terms of oxygenation with paralysis.

The assessment and plan include:
1. ARDS: Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics, decrease solumedrol dosage, keep the patient supine, continue three pressors (levo, neo, vaso) targeting pH in high 7.3 range and PaO2 > 70, attempt to wean pressors as tolerated, continue paralysis with nimbex.
2. Leukocytosis: WBC count increased from 11.5 to 31.3, which could represent inflammation from cytokine release or a new area of infection. Pan culture stool, urine, blood, and sputum should be done to investigate further.
3. Metastatic ovarian cancer, post-op ileostomy, bowel perfusion: Follow-up surgery recommendations, family meeting with the patient's husband, cousin, gynecologic oncology team, and consider transferring to comfort"
