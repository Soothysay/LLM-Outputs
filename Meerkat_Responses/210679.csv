","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of seizures from Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), who was previously intubated in the NICU due to aspiration pneumonia and NSTEMI. The patient has been extubated and transferred to the floor. He continues to experience mild respiratory distress and tachypnea. The patient has several medical conditions, including pneumonia, heart failure with decreased ejection fraction (HFrEF), and a history of NSTEMI. There are also concerns about potential tuberculosis exposure. The patient is currently receiving treatment for aspiration pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, diuretics for volume overload, and nebulizers for respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing mild respiratory distress and tachypnea. This could be due to multilobar pneumonia, heart failure-related fluid overload, or a combination of both. Monitoring and managing the patient's respiratory status, providing supplemental oxygen as needed, and continuing diuretics to manage fluid balance are essential.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which may progress to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). It is crucial to complete the full course of antibiotics and maintain appropriate respiratory hygiene to prevent further complications.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has HFrEF with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. Managing"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o M hx seizures from EEE encephalitis p/w status c/b
   aspiration PNA, intubated in NICU, and NSTEMI and extubated on [**2-21**].
   Transferred to floor on [**2-24**] and continues to have some mild
   respiratory distress, tachypneia. At this point, he has improved and
   appears more comfortable after diuresis.
   .
   # Resp distress: Suspect CHF given low EF after MI and possible
   component of residual PNA. Based on RN reports and clinical hx, I am
   less concerned for new pulm infection as no fever, white count. He had
   improved markedly with diuresis and nebs. He does not appear to have
   underlying pulm disease (non-smoking). other differntial includes other
   infection (he is being ruled out for TB but very questionable exposure
   hx - dgtr reported that her boyfriend had TB), PE (he has no pleuritic
   pain, not tachy; however, had not been on DVT ppx for past 4 days)
   - continue diuresis with goal 2L today
   - continue nebs
   - check BNP
   - no need for steroids at this point, as I suspect his wheezes are
   cardiogenic
   - if continued hypoxia, consider CTA to eval for PE, although less
   clinical suspicion
   - continue to treat aspiration PNA and complete 10 day course
   Vanc/Zosyn
   - consider trial non-invasive ventilation if contiues to tire
   - would strongly consider taking off TB precuations as highly unlikely
   for this to be the cause of his resp distress

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of seizures due to Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) who was admitted to the ICU for aspiration pneumonia, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and subsequent extubation. The patient presented with mild respiratory distress, tachypnea, and improved after diuresis. The patient's current condition is stable, but there are concerns regarding possible congestive heart failure (CHF) due to low ejection fraction (EF) after the NSTEMI, as well as residual pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient continues to have some mild respiratory distress and tachypnea. The differential diagnosis includes CHF, residual pneumonia, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE). Further evaluation with diuresis, nebulizers, and a chest CT angiography (CTA) may be necessary.
2. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures related to EEE encephalitis. Seizure precautions are in place, and monitoring with tele is recommended. Daily phenytoin (Dilantin) level checks are advised.
3. NSTEMI/CHF: The patient had an NSTEMI with elevated troponin levels, but they are now trending downward. There is debate regarding the low EF due to ischemia or stress. Re-evaluation with a repeat echoc"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o M hx seizures from EEE encephalitis p/w status c/b
   aspiration PNA, intubated in NICU, and NSTEMI and extubated on [**2-21**].
   Transferred to floor on [**2-24**] and continues to have some mild
   respiratory distress, tachypnea.
   .
   # Resp distress:   Most likely multifactorial from CHF given globally
   decreased EF, evidence of volume overload, elevated BNP, improvement
   following lasix and multilobar pneumonia.  Pneumonia either VAP, HAP or
   most likely aspiration in etiology.  Question of TB exposure, however
   least likely to contribute to picture
   - continue diuresis with goal 2L today, will likely need 40mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue nebs prn
   - continue to treat aspiration PNA and complete 10 day course
   Vanc/Zosyn, day 1 [**2173-2-20**]
   - 3 induced sputums to rule out TB, then can discontinue negative
   pressure room
   .
   # Seizures:  Secondary to EEE.
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - monitor on tele
   - check PHT levels daily
   - continue current doses of keppra, & klonopin
   - sz precautions and ativan PRN for sz > 3 min
   - Hold dilantin as level elevated
   .
   # NSTEMI/CHF: Had NSTEMI in setting of status on [**2-19**] and s/p 4 days of
   hep gtt stopped on [**2-20**]. Trops still elevated but trending downward. ?
   of troponin leak as demand ischemia. [**2-20**] TTE shows global hypokinesis
   (EF=20-25%); however, there has been some debate regarding low EF due
   to ischemia vs stress
   - continue ASA 325
   - continue metoprolol
   - started ACEI yesterday
   - repeat Echo today?
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # HTN:
   - cont metoprolol and ACEI as above
   .
   # Dyslipidemia:
   - continue statin
   .
   # FEN/GI:
   - appreciate S&S eval recs
   - stop IVF and diuresis as above
   - recheck lytes this afternoon given aggressive diuresis
   .
   # PPX:
   - protonix
   - needs SQ heparin
   - fall, aspiration, DTs and seizure precautions
   - IVF as above, thiamine and folate

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of seizures from Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), who presented with aspiration pneumonia (PNA), intubated in the NICU, and had an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was later extubated on [**2-21**]. The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2-24**] and continues to experience some mild respiratory distress and tachypnea.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory Distress: Most likely multifactorial from congestive heart failure (CHF) due to globally decreased ejection fraction (EF), evidence of volume overload, elevated Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), and improvement following lasix administration. The patient also has multilobar pneumonia, which could be either ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or aspiration pneumonia. The question of tuberculosis exposure is mentioned, but it is considered unlikely to contribute to the current picture.

Plan:
- Continue diuresis with a goal of 2 liters today, and may need 40mg IV lasix.
- Continue nebulizers as needed.
- Continue treatment for aspiration PNA and complete a 10-day course of Vanc/Zosyn, starting from [**2173-2-20**].
- Perform three induced sputum cultures to rule out"
