","The patient presents with malaise and weakness. The EKG on 05/10/2168 at 12:30 PM showed ST depression in leads V5 and V6, similar to a previous tracing. The patient then experienced chest pain 3 minutes after starting to eat, and the EKG at 04:32 PM revealed ST anterolateral depressions. Nitro gtt and dilauded 0.5 were administered, resulting in improvement of chest pain to 4/20. Lasix 40mg IV was started due to concern for worsening pulmonary edema causing demand ischemia. When nitro gtt was weaned, chest pain returned, and IV metoprolol was given along with a GI cocktail, which resolved the symptoms.

The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, causing nausea/vomiting; Vasotec (enalapril maleate), resulting in cough and rash; Cortisporin (otic), causing rash; Ciloxan (ophthalmic), with unknown reaction; and atenolol, with unknown reaction.

The patient is currently on several medications, including lorazepam (Ativan) and metoprolol. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for chest pain as noted above.

 CHEST PAIN
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)
 BRADYCARDIA
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Elderly patient presenting again, as previously, with acute on chronic
   renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia.
   .
   # Chest pain: Probably GI related given brisk improvement with GI
   cocktail and ativan. Demand ischemia also possible in the setting of
   acute on chronic heart failure given lateral ST depressions, however
   has had these depressions before. Responded to lasix gtt and GI
   cocktail. Enzymes have been negative x 2, would expect enzyme bump with
   3 hours of CP. Unstable angina via plaque rupture in the ddx but less
   likely in setting of volume overload.
   - Finish rule out
   - DC heparin gtt if 3^rd set negative
   - Consider more lasix
   # Altered mental status: Delerium, possibly secondary to infection, vs
   medications, vs ICU delirium. Consider uremia.
   - Monitor
   - Monitor creatinine
   - Frequent reorientation
   - Culture if spikes
   # Renal Failure
   Although fluid overloaded, creatinine has risen from 2.0 on [**5-4**] to 3.7
   now. Medications may have been given in error, in so far as the
   [**Hospital3 59**] list that the patient brought, OMR and DC summary list
   have some disparities. One notable new medication is Bactrim. Renal
   faiure has led to hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia,
   uremia. Uremia likely explains symptoms and hyperkalemia EKG changes.
   Urine eosinophils, microscopy, lytes will likely help.
   - Hold lisinopril for life
   - Hold hydralazine
   - Diurese gently (careful because of renal injury, but will help lower
   K) give 20 mg Lasix IV
   - Renal will see in a.m.
   - Follow BUN/Cr closely while diuresing
   .
   # Bradycardia
   Classic EKG findings of hyperkalemia, with probable junctional rhythm -
   P waves difficult to appreciate on EKG. AF with small atrial potentials
   and junctional rhythm are also possible. We will treat underlying
   hyperkalemia.
   - Correct hyperkalemia
   - Would restart coreg.
   - Hold hydralazine (if becomes hypotensive, will not be able to
   accomodate with rate).
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   Established disease with enzyme leaks in context of 'strain' recently.
   Troponin is actually near lowest level at this creatinine - but CK-MB
   elevated.
   - Continue ASA, plavix
   - Give statin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia
   Secondary to renal failure.
   - Give second dose of Kayexalate 30 mL
   - D50 1 amp and 10 units regular insulin
   .
   # Chronic congetive systolic heart failure
   LVEF 40% on [**2168-3-7**]. Taking somewhere between 40 and 80 daily. Also
   on lisinopril (either 10 or 40).
   - Hold lisinopril
   - Give small dose of Lasix for now
   - Foley and monitor I&Os
   - Hold BB (Coreg) given bradycardia
   .
   # Diabetes
   - ISS and fixed dose as per OMR 46 of glargine QHS
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine 0.2 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold hydralazine and add back as necessary (was on 75 mg TID)
   - Hold lisinopril (10 or 40 ?) given kidney injury
   - Continue amlodipine 10 QD
   .

","The patient is an elderly individual with a history of chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. The patient presented with malaise and weakness and experienced chest pain while eating, which was accompanied by ST segment depression on EKG. The patient received nitroglycerin, metoprolol, and a gastrointestinal cocktail, resulting in symptom resolution. 

The patient has a high potassium level (hyperkalemia), which is likely secondary to acute-on-chronic renal failure. The patient's creatinine level has risen from 2.0 on [**5-4**] to 3.7 now, indicating worsening renal function. The elevated creatinine, along with hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia, suggests acute renal failure. 

The patient's EKG changes are consistent with hyperkalemia, and there is evidence of Junctional rhythm or possibly atrial fibrillation with small atrial potentials. The patient's bradycardia is likely related to hyperkalemia. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and previous enzyme leaks indicating myocardial injury. 

The patient's congestive heart failure is chronic with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% and ongoing medication use, including lisinopril. However, due to the patient's renal failure, lisinopril needs to be held.

   Assessment and Plan
 CHEST PAIN
 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)
 BRADYCARDIA
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Elderly patient presenting again, as previously, with acute on chronic
   renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia.
   .
   # Chest pain: Probably demand ischemia also possible in the setting of
   acute on chronic heart failure given lateral ST depressions. Probably
   an anxiety component as well as this responded to ativan better than
   nitro gtt. Third set of enzymes were positive confirming NSTEMI via
   demand etiology. Unstable angina via plaque rupture in the ddx but less
   likely in setting of volume overload.
   - Continue heparin gtt for 48 hours from last episode of chest pain
   ([**2168-5-10**] at 4:30pm)
   - Goal negative 500-1000cc negative via lasix prn
   # Renal Failure
   Although fluid overloaded, creatinine has risen from 2.0 on [**5-4**] to 3.7
   on admission. Medications may have been given in error, in so far as
   the [**Hospital3 59**] list that the patient brought, OMR and DC summary
   list have some disparities. Particularly, lisinopril may have been
   given in excess by accident. One notable new medication is Bactrim.
   Renal faiure has led to hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia,
   hyperphosphatemia, uremia. Uremia likely explains symptoms and
   hyperkalemia EKG changes.
   - Hold lisinopril for now
   - Hold hydralazine
   - Diurese gently per above
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - Follow BUN/Cr closely while diuresing
   .
   # Bradycardia:
   Classic EKG findings of hyperkalemia, with probable junctional rhythm -
   P waves difficult to appreciate on EKG. AF with small atrial potentials
   and junctional rhythm are also possible. We will treat underlying
   hyperkalemia. Still with occasional moments of bradycardia and
   occasional dropped beat.
   - Continue to correct hyperkalemia
   - Consider restarting coreg today
   - Hold hydralazine (if becomes hypotensive, will not be able to
   accomodate with rate).
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   NSTEMI via demand per above.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, heparin gtt
   - Continue statin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolving. Secondary to renal failure.
   - Monitor
   .
   # Chronic congetive systolic heart failure
   LVEF 40% on [**2168-3-7**]. Taking somewhere between 40 and 80 daily. Also
   on lisinopril (either 10 or 40).
   - Hold lisinopril
   - Foley and monitor I&Os
   - Hold BB (Coreg) given bradycardia
   .
   # Diabetes
   - ISS and fixed dose as per OMR 46 of glargine QHS
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine 0.2 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold hydralazine and add back as necessary (was on 75 mg TID)
   - Hold lisinopril (10 or 40 ?) given kidney injury
   - Continue amlodipine 10 QD

","The patient is an elderly woman with a history of chronic renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, and hyperphosphatemia. She presents with symptoms of malaise and weakness, as well as chest pain. The EKG revealed ST depression in leads V5 and V6, which was similar to previous tracings. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 131/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The physical examination showed an overweight woman who appeared stated age, oriented x3, with no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. There was jugular venous distention (JVD) noted, along with a regular II/VI systolic murmur, normal S2, no regurgitant sounds (r/g), no thrills or lifts, and no S3 or S4 heart sounds. Crackles were heard at the lung bases, and there was edema from the upper shin, knees, and thighs 1+. No ulcers or scars were observed on the skin. 

The laboratory results indicated a white blood cell count of 5.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 30.5%, platelet count of 181 K/uL, creatinine of 3.7 mg"

   Assessment and Plan
   Elderly patient presenting again, as previously, with acute on chronic
   renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia.
   .
   # Diabetes/hypoglycemia: pt continues to have episodes of hypoglycemia
   despite decreasing doses of NPH.  [**Month (only) 11**] be from poor renal clearance of
   insulin.  Risks of insulin outweigh benefits at this point given her
   recurrent hypoglycemic events
   - D/C NPH for now
   - plan to contact [**Name (NI) 294**] for long term plan regarding insulin
   - continue scaled down sliding scale with humalog
   .
   # Renal Failure
   Improving.  The patient originally presented fluid overloaded, and
   creatinine rose from 2.0 on [**5-4**] to 3.7 on admission.  Lisinopril may
   have been given in excess by accident at [**Hospital3 59**] center. One
   notable new medication is also Bactrim. Renal faiure led to
   hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia, uremia. Uremia likely
   explains symptoms and hyperkalemia causing EKG changes.
   - Hold lisinopril for now
   - Hold hydralazine but will consider restarting
   - Diurese gently per above
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - Follow BUN/Cr closely while diuresing
   .
   # Bradycardia:
   Classic EKG findings of hyperkalemia, with probable junctional rhythm -
   P waves difficult to appreciate on EKG. AF with small atrial potentials
   and junctional rhythm are also possible. We treated underlying
   hyperkalemia. Still with occasional moments of bradycardia and
   occasional dropped beat.
   - Continue to follow potassium
   - Since recently started amlodipine for hypertension will hold on
   restarting coreg today, but will consider in future
   - Hold hydralazine (if becomes hypotensive, will not be able to
   accomodate with rate).
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   NSTEMI via demand per above.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, heparin gtt
   - Continue statin
   .
   # Chest pain: Resolved. Was likely GI related or anxiety as improved
   with GI cocktail and ativan.
   - stop hep gtt
   .
   # Troponin leak: Probably was demand ischemia in the setting of acute
   on chronic heart failure given lateral ST depressions. Third set of
   enzymes were positive confirming NSTEMI via demand etiology.
   - Stop hep gtt
   - continue to trend trop until peak
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolving. Secondary to renal failure.
   - Monitor
   .
   # Chronic congetive systolic heart failure
   LVEF 40% on [**2168-3-7**]. Taking somewhere between 40 and 80 daily. Also
   on lisinopril (either 10 or 40).
   - Hold lisinopril
   - Foley and monitor I&Os
   - Hold BB (Coreg) given recently started amlodipine, but will consider
   restarting tomorrow
   .
   # Hypertension

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from her conditions include:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced episodes of hypoglycemia despite decreasing doses of NPH insulin. This could be due to poor renal clearance of insulin. If insulin therapy is continued, the risk of recurrent hypoglycemic events needs to be closely monitored.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia secondary to renal failure. Close monitoring of potassium levels is necessary to prevent life-threatening complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, indicated by increasing creatinine levels. This can lead to further electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremia. Gentle diuresis and careful monitoring of renal function are essential.

4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which presented as NSTEMI. Ongoing management includes antiplatelet therapy, statins, and continued cardiac monitoring.

5. Bradycardia: The patient exhibits bradycardia with occasional moments of hypotension. This may be related to hyperkalemia and junctional rhythm. Monitoring of heart rate and EKG changes is necessary.

6. Chronic congestive systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Careful monitoring of fluid"

   Assessment and Plan
   Elderly patient presenting again, as previously, with acute on chronic
   renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia.
   .
   # Chest pain: Probably demand ischemia also possible in the setting of
   acute on chronic heart failure given lateral ST depressions. Probably
   an anxiety component as well as this responded to ativan better than
   nitro gtt. Third set of enzymes were positive confirming NSTEMI via
   demand etiology. Unstable angina via plaque rupture in the ddx but less
   likely in setting of volume overload.
   - Continue heparin gtt for 48 hours from last episode of chest pain
   ([**2168-5-10**] at 4:30pm)
   - Goal negative 500-1000cc negative via lasix prn
   # Renal Failure
   Although fluid overloaded, creatinine has risen from 2.0 on [**5-4**] to 3.7
   on admission. Medications may have been given in error, in so far as
   the [**Hospital3 59**] list that the patient brought, OMR and DC summary
   list have some disparities. Particularly, lisinopril may have been
   given in excess by accident. One notable new medication is Bactrim.
   Renal faiure has led to hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia,
   hyperphosphatemia, uremia. Uremia likely explains symptoms and
   hyperkalemia EKG changes.
   - Hold lisinopril for now
   - Hold hydralazine
   - Diurese gently per above
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - Follow BUN/Cr closely while diuresing
   .
   # Bradycardia:
   Classic EKG findings of hyperkalemia, with probable junctional rhythm -
   P waves difficult to appreciate on EKG. AF with small atrial potentials
   and junctional rhythm are also possible. We will treat underlying
   hyperkalemia. Still with occasional moments of bradycardia and
   occasional dropped beat.
   - Continue to correct hyperkalemia
   - Consider restarting coreg today
   - Hold hydralazine (if becomes hypotensive, will not be able to
   accomodate with rate).
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   NSTEMI via demand per above.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, heparin gtt
   - Continue statin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolving. Secondary to renal failure.
   - Monitor
   .
   # Chronic congetive systolic heart failure
   LVEF 40% on [**2168-3-7**]. Taking somewhere between 40 and 80 daily. Also
   on lisinopril (either 10 or 40).
   - Hold lisinopril
   - Foley and monitor I&Os
   - Hold BB (Coreg) given bradycardia
   .
   # Diabetes
   - ISS and fixed dose as per OMR 46 of glargine QHS
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine 0.2 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold hydralazine and add back as necessary (was on 75 mg TID)
   - Hold lisinopril (10 or 40 ?) given kidney injury
   - Continue amlodipine 10 QD

- The patient experienced an episode of CP (likely meaning cardiopulmonary) that resolved.
- She also had hypoglycemia with a blood glucose level of 38 mg/dL, which was corrected promptly.
- Insulin was reduced, and the patient will need to reduce insulin again due to poor oral intake.
- The patient expressed emotional distress regarding repeated hospitalizations and an email was sent to her primary care physician and cardiologist to discuss the appropriateness of palliative care.
- Medications were adjusted as follows: amlodipine was restarted, and lisinopril and valsartan were placed on the allergy list due to hyperkalemia.
- The patient has multiple drug allergies.
- The last dose of antibiotics was not specified.
- The patient is receiving infusions of heparin sodium and dextrose.

   Assessment and Plan
   Elderly patient presenting again, as previously, with acute on chronic
   renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia.
   .
   # Diabetes/hypoglycemia: pt continues to have episodes of hypoglycemia
   despite decreasing doses of NPH.  [**Month (only) 11**] be from poor renal clearance of
   insulin.  Risks of insulin outweigh benefits at this point given her
   recurrent hypoglycemic events
   - D/C NPH for now
   - plan to contact [**Name (NI) 294**] for long term plan regarding insulin
   - continue scaled down sliding scale with humalog
   .
   # Renal Failure
   Improving.  The patient originally presented fluid overloaded, and
   creatinine rose from 2.0 on [**5-4**] to 3.7 on admission.  Lisinopril may
   have been given in excess by accident at [**Hospital3 59**] center. One
   notable new medication is also Bactrim. Renal faiure led to
   hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia, uremia. Uremia likely
   explains symptoms and hyperkalemia causing EKG changes.
   - Hold lisinopril for now
   - Hold hydralazine but will consider restarting
   - Diurese gently per above
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - Follow BUN/Cr closely while diuresing
   .
   # Bradycardia:
   Classic EKG findings of hyperkalemia, with probable junctional rhythm -
   P waves difficult to appreciate on EKG. AF with small atrial potentials
   and junctional rhythm are also possible. We treated underlying
   hyperkalemia. Still with occasional moments of bradycardia and
   occasional dropped beat.
   - Continue to follow potassium
   - Since recently started amlodipine for hypertension will hold on
   restarting coreg today, but will consider in future
   - Hold hydralazine (if becomes hypotensive, will not be able to
   accomodate with rate).
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   NSTEMI via demand per above.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, heparin gtt
   - Continue statin
   .
   # Chest pain: Resolved. Was likely GI related or anxiety as improved
   with GI cocktail and ativan.
   - stop hep gtt
   .
   # Troponin leak: Probably was demand ischemia in the setting of acute
   on chronic heart failure given lateral ST depressions. Third set of
   enzymes were positive confirming NSTEMI via demand etiology.
   - Stop hep gtt
   - continue to trend trop until peak
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolving. Secondary to renal failure.
   - Monitor
   .
   # Chronic congetive systolic heart failure
   LVEF 40% on [**2168-3-7**]. Taking somewhere between 40 and 80 daily. Also
   on lisinopril (either 10 or 40).
   - Hold lisinopril
   - Foley and monitor I&Os
   - Hold BB (Coreg) given recently started amlodipine, but will consider
   restarting tomorrow
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine 0.2 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold hydralazine and add back as necessary (was on 75 mg TID)
   - Hold lisinopril (10 or 40 ?) given kidney injury
   - Continue amlodipine 10 QD
   - consider restarting coreg tomorrow?

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   No chest pain on medical therapy.  Struggling with hypoglycermia and we
   are making adjustments to her insulin dosage.
   Medical Decision Making
   Continue maximal medical therapy and social support.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient continues to experience episodes of hypoglycemia despite decreasing doses of NPH insulin. Poor renal clearance of insulin may contribute to these episodes.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia secondary to renal failure. This condition can lead to EKG changes and potential cardiac arrhythmias.

3. Bradycardia: The patient is experiencing bradycardia with occasional moments of bradycardia and occasional dropped beats. This could be due to hyperkalemia and junctional rhythm.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which is indicated by rising creatinine levels. This condition can lead to further electrolyte imbalances and complications.

5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and experienced an NSTEMI event. She is currently on multiple medications including ASA, Plavix, heparin, and a statin.

6. Chest pain: The patient initially presented with chest pain, which was likely GI-related or anxiety-induced. It has since resolved.

7. Troponin leak: The patient had positive troponin levels indicating myocardial injury, possibly due to demand ischemia in the setting of acute on chronic heart failure.

8. Chronic congestive systolic"

","The patient is an elderly woman with a history of acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and anxiety. She presented with episodes of hypoglycemia despite decreasing doses of NPH, which was attributed to poor renal clearance of insulin. The patient's renal failure led to hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, and uremia. Her EKG showed classic findings of hyperkalemia with a probable junctional rhythm. 

The patient also experienced bradycardia, which was treated by addressing the underlying hyperkalemia. She had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) due to demand ischemia in the setting of acute on chronic heart failure. 

The patient's chest pain resolved, likely due to a GI-related cause or anxiety. However, she had a troponin leak, which was confirmed as NSTEMI via demand etiology. 

The patient's hyperkalemia is resolving secondary to renal failure. 

In terms of medical complications, the patient's diabetes/hypoglycemia, renal failure, bradycardia, coronary artery disease, chest pain, troponin leak, and hyperkalemia are all potential complications that can arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   Elderly patient presenting again, as previously, with acute on chronic
   renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia.
   .
   # Diabetes/hypoglycemia: pt had multiple episodes of hypoglycemia
   despite decreasing doses of NPH.  [**Month (only) 11**] be from poor renal clearance of
   insulin.  Risks of insulin outweigh benefits at this point given her
   recurrent hypoglycemic events.  Consulted [**Last Name (un) 294**] (appreciate recs)
   - 16 Units NPH Q am
   - scale down sliding scale
   .
   # Renal Failure
   Improving.  The patient originally presented fluid overloaded, and
   creatinine rose from 2.0 on [**5-4**] to 3.7 on admission.  Lisinopril may
   have been given in excess by accident at [**Hospital3 59**] center. One
   notable new medication was also Bactrim. Renal faiure led to
   hyperkalemia, hypermagnasemia, hyperphosphatemia, uremia. Uremia likely
   explains symptoms and hyperkalemia causing EKG changes.  Renal failure
   improving after held lisinopril, hydralazine, and lasix.  Potassium
   still high despite improving creatinine, may have impaired potassium
   excretion.
   - continue to hold lisinopril for now
   - Continue to hold hydralazine but will consider restarting
   - hold on further diuresis as pt is producing good urine output
   - obtain urine potassium to calculate fractional excretion of potassium
   - Renal recs, appreciate their input
   - Follow BUN/Cr
   .
   # Bradycardia:
   Was likely initially from hyperkalemia.  Patient has had intermittent
   bradycardia despite correction of potassium.
   - Continue to follow potassium
   - will restart coreg (see below) but at low dose
   .
   # Coronary Artery Disease
   NSTEMI via demand per above.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, heparin gtt
   - Continue statin
   .
   # Chest pain: Resolved. Was likely GI related or anxiety as improved
   with GI cocktail and ativan.
   - stop hep gtt
   .
   # Troponin leak: Probably was demand ischemia in the setting of acute
   on chronic heart failure given lateral ST depressions. Third set of
   enzymes were positive confirming NSTEMI via demand etiology.
   - Stop hep gtt
   - continue to trend trop until peak
   # Hyperkalemia: Resolving. Secondary to renal failure.
   - Monitor
   .
   # Chronic congetive systolic heart failure
   LVEF 40% on [**2168-3-7**].
   - Hold lisinopril
   - Foley and monitor I&Os
   - restart coreg but at decreased dose given history of bradycardia
   .
   # Hypertension
   - Continue clonidine 0.2 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hold hydralazine and add back as necessary (was on 75 mg TID)
   - Hold lisinopril (10 or 40 ?) given kidney injury
   - Continue amlodipine 10 QD
   - restart coreg (but at smaller dose) and monitor HR

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic congestive systolic heart failure, and hypertension. She presented to the ICU with acute on chronic renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia. She also had episodes of hypoglycemia despite decreasing doses of NPH. The patient's conditions include presumed full code, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, balance, gait, knowledge, and transfers. She is anxious and has a history of chest pain, bradycardia, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient had multiple episodes of hypoglycemia despite decreasing doses of NPH. This indicates that the current insulin therapy may need to be adjusted or discontinued due to poor renal clearance of insulin in the context of acute renal failure.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other complications. Monitoring and managing potassium levels will be crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Bradycardia: The patient has intermittent bradycardia despite correction of potassium levels. This may be due to her underlying coronary artery disease or medications such as lisinopril. Close monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of medication doses will be necessary.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating further, leading to accumulation"
