   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   A 68 year old gentleman was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] (scheduled for floor
   admission) from [**Hospital 11374**] Community Hospital at the request of his
   family for ongoing pneumonia not improving with Abx.  There was also
   being treated for afib, ?CHF  and possible UE DVT. Head CT normal
   there.  Echo there with ? TV vegetation, normal EF.  During the Medivac
   (per flow sheet): patient ambulatory prior to flight.  During the
   flight he was in Afib, satting 96-100% on 3L NC.  Never hypotensive or
   tachycardic. BS varied from 81-441 (pre/post dextrose administration).
   Patient became confused ~16:15. His rate increased to 110-130  ~ 17:00,
   labelled as ? for which he received 100mg Lidocaine, presumably IV just
   prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 1**].  After deplaning from a medivac flight, the
   patient became unresponsive and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1**] emergency
   room.
   In the ED, vital signs were initially: 96.9 69 180/84 12 100% NRB.
   Patient was intubated for airway protection given unresponsiveness
   (Etomidate & Succ for intubation; Propofol for sedation).  He was given
   Vanc/Zosyn for HAP vs. abdominal process. BS in the 70s, given D50
   without change in mental status.  Transferred to the MICU: 96.4 120/59
   14 100% 500/14/10/1.0.
   On arrival to the floor, the patient is not responsive to voice or
   sternal rub.  His family is present and confirm the hospital course.
   Per all reports, he was independent at home and still working but
   ""slowing down"" recently with weight loss, several recent
   hospitalizations for pneumonia.  His rapid change in status today was
   unexpected and not at all resembling his recent hospital course.

   #. Altered Mental Status: The patient has underlying dementia as
   evidenced by family &  recent notes. His acute decline midflight
   appears to correspond roughly to a rapid ventricular rate and lidocaine
   administration.  Seizure vs. anoxic brain injury at altitude/arrythmia,
   clot or septic emboli showering from ? vegitation.  Currently
   improving, making anoxic injury less likely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman who was admitted to the ICU for ongoing pneumonia not improving with antibiotics, atrial fibrillation, possible upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and unclear heart failure. The patient was previously hospitalized for pneumonia and is currently unresponsive. He was found to have vegetation on the tricuspid valve, which could be indicative of infective endocarditis. The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and a possible abdominal mass. He has been treated with various antibiotics, and his current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, famotidine, dextrose, levothyroxine, folate, vitamin D, and creon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's acute change in mental status during/after the flight may be due to various factors such as seizure, anoxic brain injury at altitude/arhythmia, or clot/septic emboli showering from vegetation. Currently, the patient is improving, making anoxic injury less likely.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia over the past two weeks. It is possible that the chest X-ray findings represent old pneumonia not yet cleared.
3. Hypothermia: The patient was concerned for sepsis vs. hypothyroidism vs. impaired shivering given mental status. Now improved, the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of pneumonia and recent hospitalizations. He was transferred to the ICU due to an acute change in mental status during and after a medivac flight. The patient is unresponsive and intubated for airway protection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has underlying dementia and an acute decline in mental status. Daily wake-up calls will be conducted to assess mental status, an EEG will be done in the morning, and an echo will be performed to evaluate for vegetation or clot.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for presumed aspiration PNA over the past two weeks. It is possible that the chest X-ray findings represent old PNA not yet cleared. Continuing Vanc/Zosyn, respiratory support, blood cultures, sputum cultures, and following up with outside microbiology results are recommended.

3. Hypothermia: The patient may have sepsis, hypothyroidism, or impaired shivering due to mental status. Warming blanket and cultures should be initiated.

4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient recently diuresed for ""heart failure"" based on CXR findings. Fluid resuscitation, permissive hypercapnia, and monitoring urine output should be considered.

5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has highly variable blood sugars. Adjusting home lantus"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   A 68 year old gentleman was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] (scheduled for floor
   admission) from [**Hospital 11374**] Community Hospital at the request of his
   family for ongoing pneumonia not improving with Abx.  There was also
   being treated for afib, ?CHF  and possible UE DVT. Head CT normal
   there.  Echo there with ? TV vegetation, normal EF.  During the Medivac
   (per flow sheet): patient ambulatory prior to flight.  During the
   flight he was in Afib, satting 96-100% on 3L NC.  Never hypotensive or
   tachycardic. BS varied from 81-441 (pre/post dextrose administration).
   Patient became confused ~16:15. His rate increased to 110-130  ~ 17:00,
   labelled as ? for which he received 100mg Lidocaine, presumably IV just
   prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 1**].  After deplaning from a medivac flight, the
   patient became unresponsive and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1**] emergency
   room.
   In the ED, vital signs were initially: 96.9 69 180/84 12 100% NRB.
   Patient was intubated for airway protection given unresponsiveness
   (Etomidate & Succ for intubation; Propofol for sedation).  He was given
   Vanc/Zosyn for HAP vs. abdominal process. BS in the 70s, given D50
   without change in mental status.  Transferred to the MICU: 96.4 120/59
   14 100% 500/14/10/1.0.
   On arrival to the floor, the patient is not responsive to voice or
   sternal rub.  His family is present and confirm the hospital course.
   Per all reports, he was independent at home and still working but
   ""slowing down"" recently with weight loss, several recent
   hospitalizations for pneumonia.  His rapid change in status today was
   unexpected and not at all resembling his recent hospital course.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, possible congestive heart failure, and a suspected upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. He was admitted to the ICU after becoming unresponsive during a medivac flight. The patient's vital signs upon arrival were stable, but he was intubated for airway protection due to unresponsiveness. He has been receiving antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia, but no fever or leukocytosis was observed. The patient also has a history of hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, chronic pancreatitis, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's acute decline in mental status during the flight and subsequent unresponsiveness may indicate a possible seizure or anoxic brain injury. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
2. Pneumonia: Despite receiving various antibiotics, the patient's pneumonia has not improved. It is important to continue the current antibiotic regimen and obtain sputum and blood cultures to identify the causative organism.
3. Hypothermia: The patient was initially concerned for sepsis, hypothyroidism, or impaired shivering. Now that his temperature has improved, warming measures are no longer necessary.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient may have metabolic alkalosis due to recent diuresis for suspected heart failure. Fluid resuscitation and monitoring urine output are recommended.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels have been highly variable, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Adjustments in insulin dosage and tube feeds are necessary.
6. Right Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is currently anticoagulated, but further evaluation of the right upper extremity is required, including obtaining outside records and repeating ultrasonography.
7. Sick Sinus Syndrome: The patient's cardiac rhythm is currently paced and rate-controlled without medications. Lidocaine administration during transit should be evaluated.
8. Cardiac Valve Vegetation: The patient has evidence of cardiac valve vegetation seen on CT scan. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned to assess the extent of involvement, and if needed, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be considered.
9. Cerebral Ventricular Dilation: The patient may have normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) as a possible cause of cerebral ventricular dilation. Further symptom history from the family is needed.
10. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient may require a gastrostomy tube placement for suspected esophagitis. Nutritional recommendations and clarification of the degree of esophagitis are necessary.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details may be required for a more comprehensive analysis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, possible congestive heart failure, and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. He was transferred to the ICU from another hospital due to ongoing pneumonia not responding to antibiotics, confusion, increased heart rate, and unresponsiveness. The patient has underlying dementia and an acute change in mental status during/after transportation. He is currently unresponsive and intubated for airway protection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's acute decline midflight appears to correspond roughly to a rapid ventricular rate and lidocaine administration. Possible causes include seizure, anoxic brain injury at altitude/arrhythmia, clot, or septic emboli showering from vegetation. Daily wake-up to assess mental status, EEG, echo to evaluate vegetation/clot, LP if no improvement, obtain OSH CSF results, TSH, and check ammonia are recommended.
2. Pneumonia (Presumed Aspiration): The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for a presumed aspiration pneumonia over the past two weeks. Not febrile, no leukocytosis, possible that CXR findings represent old PNA not yet cleared. Continue Vanc/Zosyn now, respiratory support as above until mental status clears, blood CX, sputum CX, F/U OSH Micro, and add on legionella urinary antigen are advised.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   A 68 year old gentleman was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] (scheduled for floor
   admission) from [**Hospital 11374**] Community Hospital at the request of his
   family for ongoing pneumonia not improving with Abx.  There was also
   being treated for afib, ?CHF  and possible UE DVT. Head CT normal
   there.  Echo there with ? TV vegetation, normal EF.  During the Medivac
   (per flow sheet): patient ambulatory prior to flight.  During the
   flight he was in Afib, satting 96-100% on 3L NC.  Never hypotensive or
   tachycardic. BS varied from 81-441 (pre/post dextrose administration).
   Patient became confused ~16:15. His rate increased to 110-130  ~ 17:00,
   labelled as ? for which he received 100mg Lidocaine, presumably IV just
   prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 1**].  After deplaning from a medivac flight, the
   patient became unresponsive and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1**] emergency
   room.
   In the ED, vital signs were initially: 96.9 69 180/84 12 100% NRB.
   Patient was intubated for airway protection given unresponsiveness
   (Etomidate & Succ for intubation; Propofol for sedation).  He was given
   Vanc/Zosyn for HAP vs. abdominal process. BS in the 70s, given D50
   without change in mental status.  Transferred to the MICU: 96.4 120/59
   14 100% 500/14/10/1.0.
   On arrival to the floor, the patient is not responsive to voice or
   sternal rub.  His family is present and confirm the hospital course.
   Per all reports, he was independent at home and still working but
   ""slowing down"" recently with weight loss, several recent
   hospitalizations for pneumonia.  His rapid change in status today was
   unexpected and not at all resembling his recent hospital course.

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, possible congestive heart failure, and a possible upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing an acute change in mental status during a medivac flight. The patient is unresponsive and has been intubated for airway protection. He has been treated with various antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show hypothermia, metabolic alkalosis, and variable blood sugars. He also has anemia, a liver lesion, and possible cardiac valve vegetation. The patient is currently being treated with vanc/Zosyn, propofol, famotidine, dextrose, and levothyroxine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's acute decline in mental status could be due to various factors such as seizure, anoxic brain injury, or clot/septic emboli showering from vegetation on the tricuspid valve.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for ongoing pneumonia.
- He was transferred from another hospital and became confused during the flight, with his heart rate increasing to 110-170 beats per minute.
- Upon arrival at the new hospital, he became unresponsive and was intubated for airway protection.
- He received antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and his blood sugar levels were stabilized without improvement in mental status.
- The patient's condition has remained unresponsive with fluctuating vital signs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's rapid change in status, confusion, and increased heart rate could be indicative of sepsis, especially considering the presence of pneumonia and hospital-acquired infections.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's ongoing pneumonia may worsen due to his unresponsive state and inability to clear secretions.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of blood clots, which can lead to DVT and potentially life-threatening PE.
5. Medication errors: Due to the patient's unresponsive state, there is a risk of medication administration errors.
6. Barotrauma: High airway pressures during mechanical ventilation can lead to"

   A 68 yo gentleman with progressive decline transferred from [**Location (un) 11374**]
   after PNA/AMS with an acute change in mental status during/after
   [**Location (un) 1045**].
   #. Altered Mental Status: The patient has underlying dementia as
   evidenced by family &  recent notes. His acute decline midflight
   appears to correspond roughly to a rapid ventricular rate and lidocaine
   administration.  Seizure vs. anoxic brain injury at altitude/arrythmia,
   clot or septic emboli showering from ? vegitation.  Currently
   unresponsive and intubated for airway protection.
   - Daily wake up to assess mental status
   - EEG in AM
   - Echo to eval vegitation/clot
   - LP if no improvement
   - Obtain OSH CSF results
   - TSH
   - Check Ammonia
   #. PNA: The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for a
   presumed aspiration PNA over the past 2 weeks. Not febrile, no
   leukocytosis, possible that CXR findings represent old PNA not yet
   cleared.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn now
   - Respiratory support as above until mental status clears
   - Blood Cx, Sputum Cx
   - F/U OSH Micro
   - Add on legionella urinary antigen
   #. Hypothermia: Concern for sepsis vs. hypothyroidism vs. impaired
   shivering given mental status.
   - Warming blanket
   - Cultures
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis: Patient recently diuresed for ""heart failure""
   based on CXR findings, although it is unclear he has heart failure.  No
   exposure to steroids, unable to compensate because of mechanical
   ventilation.
   - Permissive hypercapnia
   - Fluid rescusitation
   - Monitor UOP
   #. Diabetes Mellitus: Highly variable blood sugars
   - Reduce home lantus to 8, Humalog SS + dextrose PRN
   - Tube feeds
   #. ? RUE DVT: Currently therpeutic INR, U/S results not in records
   - Obtain outside records
   - Repeat RUE U/S
   - Transition to heparin drip if INR <2
   #. Sick Sinus: Paced, currently anticoagulated and rate controlled
   without medications, received Lidocaine in transit.
   - Hold metoprolol/diltiazem while rate controlled
   - Cardiac Enzymes
   #. Ventricular Dilitation: Possible NPH as cause, will obtain further
   symptom history from family.
   #. G-tube placement for ? esophagitis:  Will contact team in [**Name (NI) 490**]
   re: need for G-tube, in patient vs. outpatient GI to address esophageal
   issues, speech and swallow once awake.
   - start Tube feeds, nutrition recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of progressive decline, transferred from another location after pneumonia and altered mental status. He is currently intubated and unresponsive, with a history of underlying dementia. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia, but is not febrile or leukocytotic. Imaging shows evidence of a 13 mm soft tissue density nodule on the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, concerning for infective endocarditis. There are also findings of left upper and lower lobe pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, left hepatic lobe atrophy, central biliary ductal dilatation, intermediate density right renal lesions, and marked atherosclerotic disease. Microbiology results are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The presence of a vegetation on the tricuspid valve raises concern for infective endocarditis. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram is recommended.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of left upper and lower lobe pneumonia, which may require aggressive treatment with antibiotics.
3. Pleural Effusions: The bilateral pleural effusions should be evaluated further to determine the cause and guide management.
4. Hepatic Lobe Atrophy: The left hepatic lobe atrophy and central biliary ductal dilatation may indicate underlying liver disease or biliary obstruction. Further assessment with an MRI"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, chronic pancreatitis, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a history of congestive heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and pneumonia. The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration events and is currently intubated. He has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infective Endocarditis: The patient has a 13 mm nodule on the tricuspid valve, which is concerning for infective endocarditis. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram is recommended.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has left upper and lower lobe pneumonia, as well as bilateral pleural effusions. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and pleural fluid should be sent for cytology.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has a high bicarbonate level, which may be due to contraction alkalosis or other causes. Further evaluation with an ABG is necessary.
4. Right Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the initial ultrasound did not show any evidence of DVT, the patient's risk factors (immobility, ICU stay) make it important to monitor for this complication and repeat the ultrasound if indicated.
5. Liver Lesions: The patient has heterogeneous enhancement of"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman who was transferred from OSH with progressive pneumonia and tricuspid valve vegetation. He arrived in the ICU with atrial flutter, respiratory distress, and hypoxemia. The patient was intubated upon arrival and received IV lidocaine. Overnight, his condition improved, and he was weaned down on ventilator settings.

The patient has a history of malignancy and complicated paracentesis, which may contribute to his current respiratory failure. He has been empirically treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia. Blood cultures have been negative to date.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/50 to 138/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 79%. His temperature is within normal range. The patient has been sedated and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated platelet count. The patient's creatinine level is within normal range, and troponin T levels are negative. Imaging reveals a large right pleural effusion with scattered ground-glass opacities, and microbiology results are pending.

He has been treated empirically with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and his cultures are pending. The patient also has a history of malignancy and complicated paraneoplastic disease. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/50-138/61 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 15-20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 79% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume set at 0-450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 36 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O, respiratory system compliance of 32.1 cmH2O/mL, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.32, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, and PaO2 of 32 mmHg.

On physical examination, the patient appears to be well-nourished but thin. His eyes and conjunctiva are normal, and he has an endotracheal tube in place. Cardiovascular examination reveals a loud second heart sound (S2) and an"

The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including endocarditis, hypoglycemia, altered mental status, pneumonia, aspiration, and chronic kidney disease. The patient was transferred to the ICU from another hospital due to progressive decline in mental status during and after treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). 

The patient has been treated for nosocomial pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood cultures and sputum cultures have been negative for Legionella and hospital-acquired pneumonia. An echocardiogram was performed to evaluate the tricuspid valve vegetation, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is pending. Thoracentesis was also performed to remove 800 cc of transudative fluid from the right pleural effusion. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/82 mmHg to 163/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and on invasive ventilation mode PSV/SBT with a tidal volume of 250 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of altered mental status, suspected endocarditis, pneumonia due to aspiration, and hypoglycemia. The patient underwent various diagnostic procedures including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), thoracentesis, and an ultrasound of the left upper quadrant (LUE U/S). An invasive ventilation device was placed due to failure of the video swallow study and concerns for aspiration. The patient's cardiologist is awaiting updates as they had planned on obtaining a TEE for further characterization of the tricuspid valve vegetation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/82 mmHg to 163/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics, famotidine, and dextrose. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's history of erosive esophagitis and previous radiation, there is an increased risk of aspiration, leading to pneumonia.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's tricuspid valve vegetation requires further evaluation and management. If left untreated, it can lead to complications such as heart failure, embolization, or systemic infection.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a progressive decline in health.
- He was transferred from a previous location due to pneumonia and altered mental status.
- The patient has multiple medical conditions, including endocarditis, hypoglycemia, altered mental status, pneumonia, and aspiration.
- He has undergone various procedures such as a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), thoracentesis, and placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
- His lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and altered electrolyte levels.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are highly variable.
- He has multiple pending investigations, including an electroencephalogram (EEG), TSH level, ammonia level, blood cultures, sputum cultures, and imaging studies.
- The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics for pneumonia, anticoagulation for suspected right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), rate control for sick sinus syndrome, and management of various other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and now has nosocomial pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are crucial to prevent worsening of the infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of progressive pneumonia and acute respiratory failure. He was transferred from another hospital and is currently in the ICU. The patient was extubated yesterday and had a thoracentesis procedure, where 860cc of straw-colored fluid was removed. He experienced some confusion overnight and had low blood glucose levels this morning. The patient denies shortness of breath or pain.

The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, and hypertension. His social history includes smoking. The patient's family history is significant for lung cancer in a first-degree relative.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for wheezing overnight. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.5°C (95.9°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 140/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support with a pressure-controlled mode (PC) set at 5 cmH2O, with spontaneous breathing allowed.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds on the right side, but rhonchi and decreased breath sounds on the left side. His cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, and his peripheral pulses are present. His abdomen is soft and non-t"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/49 to 125/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST, set tidal volume of 430 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 32 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is between 54-63%. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, and dextrose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic: The patient's low blood pressure and need for vasopressor support indicate possible hypovolemia or hemorrhagic shock.
2. Endocarditis, other: The presence of fever and positive blood cultures suggests the possibility of an infection, such as endocarditis.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood glucose levels indicate a risk of hypoglycemia.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presented with altered mental status, fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, and was found to have a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. After resuscitation, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. 

Upon admission to the ICU, the patient was on low-dose levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, intermittent IVNS boluses, and weaned off levophed in the evening. A continuous EEG monitoring was ordered, showing a flat electroencephalogram (CE flat). An echocardiogram revealed mild global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45% (from >55% pre-arrest), with no major valvular abnormalities. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 79 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 108/49 to 125/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube ventilation. The patient's weight is 63.1 kg.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of progressive decline, including pneumonia, altered mental status, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient is currently intubated and in the ICU. 

Medical Complications:
1. Shock, Hypovolemic or Hemorrhagic: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis as well as sedating medications. Levophed is being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. 
2. Endocarditis, Other: A tricuspid valve mass was noted on imaging, but it is not an acute issue.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient had a low blood glucose level, and measures are in place to prevent further episodes.
4. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient's mental status is altered, and continuous EEG monitoring has been initiated. Sedation will be weaned off to assess neurologic status.
5. Pneumonia, Aspiration: The patient has recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Tube feeds are being held, and the patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is being monitored.
6. Cardiac Arrhythmia: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). Rate control is ongoing, and anticoagulation is being provided due to the presence"

   A 68 yo gentleman with progressive decline transferred from [**Location (un) 11374**]
   after PNA/AMS with an acute change in mental status during/after
   [**Location (un) 1045**].
   # PEA Arrest: given tube feeds in suctioning and high aspiration risk,
   aspiration event leading to code was the likely inciting event.  No
   events on tele, and PEA was a tachycardia (afib with RVR).
   -hold tube feeds
   -obtain CXR and repeat ABG
   -send cardiac enzymes, ROMI
   -lactate elevated to 5.0, give 1 L NS and monitor UOP, trend lactate
   -monitor tele.
   # Altered MS: the patient has had some anoxic injury however still had
   purposeful movments following intubation, pulling at ET tube, but
   currently is sedated on propofol.
   -attempt to wean propofol, daily wake ups and monitor neurologic status
   -subacute course of urinary incontinence, gait difficulty (shuffling
   without other signs of parkinsons) and memory / attention deficits in
   addition to CT imaging of head would imply possible NPH which should be
   worked up in the future.
   # Aspiration event: Had PNA prior to his transfer to the [**Hospital1 1**].  Today
   [**3-6**] is day 14 of Zosyn, also on vancomycin.
   -continue broad spectrum abx for now given new aspiration event
   -f/u CXR
   # Afib with RVR: PPM, dual chamber, new afib.
   -contninue heparin goal PTT 50-70
   -continue metoprolol at increased dose of 37.5mg po tid
   # Tricuspid valve mass:   CT [**Doctor First Name **] consulted.  Not acute issue.  F/u CT
   [**Doctor First Name **] recs.
   # Hepatic lesions: f/u final read of multiphasic CT scan of the liver.
   # Diarrhea: check C diff.
   # Hematuria: Likely foley trauma in setting of heparin gtt.
   - continue to monitor, flush prn, when extubated can remove foley
   # Diabetes Mellitus: hold tube feeds, decrease lantus to 4 units qhs
   and sliding scale.
   # Anemia: Iron studies c/w ACD.
   - cont. to monitor
   #CAD:
   - cont. metoprolol and ASA, heparin drip for afib
   # Chronic pancreatitis:
   - cont. Creon with meals/tube feeds.
   # Erosive esophagitis: Seen on EGD at OSH.
   - change famotidine to PPI.
   FEN: no IVFs, monitor/replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   PPx: PPI, heparin gtt, bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of progressive decline, pneumonia, altered mental status, and recent cardiac arrest. He was transferred from another location after experiencing a change in mental status during/after a procedure. The patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which he was resuscitated and intubated. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated lactate levels suggest possible shock. Further evaluation and management are necessary.
2. Endocarditis, other: The presence of a tricuspid valve mass on CT scan may indicate endocarditis. Further investigation and follow-up are required.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level of 46 mg/dL indicates hypoglycemia. This needs to be addressed and monitored closely.
4. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's altered mental status is a concern and may be due to anoxic injury or another underlying cause. Daily wake-ups and monitoring of neurological status are recommended.
5. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient has had multiple episodes of aspiration leading to pneumonia. Continued broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage is necessary, and follow-up chest X-ray is advised.
6. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient"

   antibiotic.  CXR also with evidence of pulmonary edema , so can try to
   diurese.
   Aspiration:  will ask IR to convert G to J tube.
   Shock:  still on low dose neo, may be due to sedation.  Hold further
   IVF.
   Also had family meeting with patient
s daughters and wife.  Discussed
   that his long term prognosis is unclear at this point, but likely he
   will need a prolonged rehab stay to recover from this episode.  They
   note that he had a subacute decline, and mainly was able to function
   with a lot of support from his wife.   Currently because if he worsened
   and had an arrest prognosis would be much poorer, he has been made
   DNR/DNI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and remote mantle radiation therapy (XRT) who has been readmitted to the MICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, obtundation, recurrent aspiration, hematuria, tricuspid valve mass, hepatic lesions, diarrhea, and hypoglycemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PEA arrest - likely due to hypoxemic respiratory failure from aspiration.
2. Septic shock - presumed septic shock given the patient's aspiration history and the presence of GNRs in sputum.
3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure - probable aspiration with evidence of GNRs in sputum.
4. Recurrent aspiration - failed bedside swallow yesterday; continued aspiration of tube feeds.
5. Obtundation - despite sedation hold; will assess off sedation today.
6. Tricuspid valve mass - CT consulted; not an acute issue.
7. Hepatic lesions - final read of multiphasic CT scan of the liver.
8. Diarrhea - check C. difficile.
9. Hypoglycemia - cut Lantus dose in half.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and remote mantle radiation therapy who subsequently developed an esophageal stricture. The patient underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on [**2171-2-26**]. He was readmitted to the MICU on [**2171-3-6**] after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PEA arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, which is a type of cardiac arrest where there is no effective blood flow due to abnormal heart rhythms. The most likely cause in this case seems to be hypoxemia from plugging/aspiration. Immediate treatment for respiratory failure is required.
2. Shock: The patient is presumed to be in septic shock given his history of aspiration and no evidence of cardiogenic shock at this point. Fluid resuscitation, weaning of norepinephrine, and monitoring of ScvO2 should be done.
3. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has hypoxemic respiratory failure due to probable aspiration. Gram-negative rods (GNRs) were found in sputum from [**3-3**]. Continuing vancomycin and Zosyn for now, with follow-up cultures, is advised.
4. Obtundation: The patient remains obtunded despite a"

The patient is currently receiving furosemide 40 mg IV and pantoprazole (Protonix) via infusion. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/60 mmHg to 146/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a history of recent hospitalization and multiple comorbidities. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,933 mL with an output of 955 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,978 mL. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 430 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 29 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's intubation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of progressive decline, who was transferred from another location due to pneumonia and altered mental status. He experienced an acute change in mental status with recurrent aspiration pneumonia and subsequently had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including shock, endocarditis, hypoglycemia, altered mental status, pneumonia due to aspiration, and chronic pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has developed recurrent aspiration pneumonia, which increases the risk of respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis.
2. Endocarditis: The presence of a tricuspid valve mass suggests the possibility of infective endocarditis. If left untreated, it can lead to serious complications like heart failure, embolic events, or even systemic infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability. If not managed appropriately, it can result in organ dysfunction or failure.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status, along with a history of diabetes mellitus, increases the risk of further neurological complications like delirium or cerebral edema.
5. Hematuria: The presence of hematuria may be indicative of urinary tract trauma or infection. If left untreated, it can lead to renal complications such as acute kidney injury.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old gentleman who was admitted with progressive decline and transferred from another location after experiencing pneumonia and altered mental status. He had an acute change in mental status with recurrent aspiration pneumonia, leading to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest but regained pulse and is currently intubated.

The patient's current medical conditions include shock (hypovolemic or hemorrhagic), endocarditis, hypoglycemia, altered mental status (not delirium), and pneumonia due to aspiration.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory support. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening respiratory distress.

2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has hypotension, which is being managed with levophed. There is a risk of further cardiovascular compromise or septic shock.

3. Neurological status: The patient has altered mental status and is undergoing continuous EEG monitoring. There is a risk of worsening neurological condition or development of seizures.

4. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing additional infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or urinary tract infection due to indwelling lines and catheters.

5. Hepatic lesions: The patient has hepatic lesions, which may require further investigation and management.

6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has"

   Patient is critically Ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old man with respiratory failure and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest due to aspiration pneumonia. He has shown improvement overnight, including being afebrile and diuresed. The plan is to get him a G to J tube today and wean him off the pressors.

His allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin at 8:00 AM and piperacillin-tazobactam at 6:23 AM.

He is currently on several medications, including midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, pantoprazole (Protonix), furosemide (Lasix), and others such as colace, folate, vitamin D, synthroid, ASA, and SSI.

There are no changes to his medical and family history, review of systems, or review of systems except as noted above and below.

The flow sheet data as of 9:20 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/58 mmHg to 146/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

His weight is 63.1 kg, and he has received a total of 2,933 mL of fluids, with an output of 2,828 mL. He has received blood products totaling 955 mL and has had a urine output of 955 mL. The NG tube output was -165 mL.

The respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 430 mL, spontaneous Vt of 469 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 29 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is deferred due to PEEP > 10. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 290 mmHg, and oxygen consumption (VE) of 8.1 L/min.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal cardiovascular function, bilateral crackles in the chest, right lower extremity edema, and cool skin. Neurologic examination shows the patient responding to verbal stimuli and following simple commands.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 12.5 to 20.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 28.6 to 29.2 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 578 to 540 K/uL"

","The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of progressive decline, including pneumonia, altered mental status, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest but regained pulse and is currently intubated.

The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation (AFIB), hypotension, endocarditis, hypoglycemia, altered mental status, pneumonia due to aspiration, and anemia. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and the family prefers comfort care.

Medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's aspiration pneumonia and being on mechanical ventilation increase the risk of further respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Pneumonia and endocarditis increase the risk of systemic infections.
3. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension during the PEA arrest and shock increases the risk of recurrent hypotension.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: AFIB and the presence of an irregular rhythm indicate a risk for other cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of diabetes and hypoglycemia raises the possibility of DKA, especially if not properly managed.
6. Hepatic complications: The presence of hepatic lesions and altered liver function tests suggest potential hepatic complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of progressive decline, including atrial fibrillation (AFIB), shock, endocarditis, hypoglycemia, altered mental status, pneumonia, and aspiration. The patient was transferred from another location after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, from which he regained his pulse. He is currently intubated.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has a history of AFIB, which is currently well-controlled with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. Lopressor has been held due to hypotension. Heparin will be restarted in the morning if the patient remains stable overnight. Warfarin will be started in the morning as well.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, likely related to sepsis and sedating medications. Levophed will continue to be used to maintain blood pressure. Sedation will be weaned off as tolerated.

3. Aspiration Pneumonia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. His PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 200, and he will continue on current ventilator settings. Post-pyloric tube placement has been held pending further evaluation. 

4. PEA Arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, which is still pending further assessment of neuro"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of progressive decline, including an acute change in mental status and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He was transferred from another location and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, but regained pulse and is now intubated. The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation (AF), hypotension, endocarditis, hypoglycemia, altered mental status (not delirium), and pneumonia due to aspiration.

Based on the assessment and plan, the patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient's heart rhythm is currently well-controlled with a rate of 80 beats per minute, but further monitoring and management are required.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits at present, but there is a concern for potential hypotension due to underlying conditions such as shock or hemorrhage.

3. Endocarditis: The presence of a tricuspid valve mass suggests possible endocarditis. Further evaluation and treatment are needed.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is low, indicating a need for careful monitoring and management of blood sugar levels.

5. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to various factors including hypoglycemia, sepsis, or other underlying conditions. Close"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of smoking. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. He has been experiencing agitation, discomfort, and difficulty breathing. Despite being on sedation and analgesia, the patient remains agitated and uncomfortable. There is a plan to await medical readiness to extubate, but no re-intubation. The patient's family would like to speak with social work and palliative care regarding planning for after extubation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9 C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 122/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen. The patient has been receiving various medications including propofol, furosemide, haloperidol, midazolam, and fentanyl. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with an elevated PaCO2. The patient's chest x-ray reveals bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. The patient's current care includes nutrition through a feeding tube, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for"

   extubated, but if no clinical improvement, will likely lean toward CMO.
   - continue to update family
   - palliative care

   # Aspiration PNA / respiratory failure: on PSV, requiring intermittent
   sedation. Barrier of extubation is mostly mental status now.
   -attempt to wean ventilatory support if possible; will keep intubated
   today because other arrangements (palliative care, pain control, family

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of progressive decline, including pneumonia, altered mental status, and recurrent aspiration leading to cardiac arrest. The patient's condition has not improved despite medical interventions, and the family has changed their wishes to do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI). The goal of care is to provide comfort and support the patient's wishes. The patient requires ongoing respiratory support and sedation due to mental status barriers to extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recurrent aspiration puts him at risk for further episodes of aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current reliance on mechanical ventilation indicates respiratory failure. Continued inability to wean off ventilatory support may indicate a chronic respiratory failure.
3. Delirium or Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status poses a barrier to extubation and increases the risk of delirium or further cognitive decline.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes and is at risk for hypoglycemia, especially during periods of fasting or inadequate insulin management.
5. Hematuria: The presence of hematuria suggests possible bladder trauma or infection. This could lead to complications such as urinary tract infection or further bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a declining condition due to pneumonia and altered mental status. He experienced recurrent aspiration leading to a cardiac arrest and was reintubated. The family has changed the patient's code status to DNR/DNI, opting for comfort care instead.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's difficulty with weaning off ventilatory support suggests a high risk of respiratory failure upon extubation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, which increases the risk of developing further respiratory infections.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood glucose levels indicate a risk for hypoglycemia, particularly if the tube feeds are held or discontinued.

4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's history of shock, hypovolemia, or hemorrhagic events may lead to ongoing hemodynamic instability.

5. Endocarditis: The presence of tricuspid valve mass warrants further evaluation for potential endocarditis.

6. Hepatic lesions: The outpatient follow-up for hepatic lesions suggests an underlying liver condition that may contribute to the patient's overall decline.

7. Foley trauma: The hematuria could be due to foley catheter trauma, especially considering the use of heparin during the patient's hospitalization.

8. Anemia: The patient's anemia requires ongoing monitoring, and iron studies suggest a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a progressive decline in health.
- He was transferred from another location due to pneumonia and altered mental status, leading to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
- The patient was resuscitated and reintubated.
- The family has changed the patient's code status to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) and wishes for comfort care.
- The patient has several medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation (AF), possible endocarditis, hypoglycemia, altered mental status (not delirium), pneumonia caused by aspiration, and chronic kidney disease.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires intermittent sedation and is on pressure support ventilation (PSV).
- The main barrier to extubation is the patient's mental status.
- There are multiple pending issues, such as the role of continuing antibiotics, evaluation of hepatic lesions, management of hematuria, and consideration for a pacemaker with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) function.
- The patient has several chronic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, anemia, chronic pancreatitis, erosive esophagitis, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration, which has led to pneumonia. This condition can worsen if proper precautions are not taken"

   # Goal of care: family recently changed code to DNR/DNI, wishing for

   extubated, but if no clinical improvement, will likely lean toward CMO.
   - continue to update family
   - palliative care
   - pain control

   # Aspiration PNA / respiratory failure: on PSV, requiring intermittent
   sedation. Barrier of extubation is mostly mental status now.
   -attempt to wean ventilatory support if possible; will keep intubated
   today because other arrangements (palliative care, pain control, family
   wishes) need to be sorted out before extubation
   - diuresed for goal -500 cc I/O today
   -continue vanc/pip-tazo (day 1 = [**3-6**]) x 8 days
   # Afib: currently well rate controlled HR 80s, in sinus
   -continue metoprolol
   -hold anticoagulation given hematuria
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: likely multifactorial, secondary to hypotension during arrest,
   contrast load, etc.
   # Elevated INR: No warfarin. Most likely from nutritional deficiency,
   antibiotics.
   - vitamin K
   # Tricuspid valve mass:   CT [**Doctor First Name **] consulted.  Not acute issue.  F/u CT
   [**Doctor First Name **] recs.
   # Hepatic lesions: outpatient follow up, pending goal of care.
   # Hematuria: Likely foley trauma in setting of heparin gtt.
   - continue to monitor, flush prn, when extubated can remove foley
   # Diabetes Mellitus: hold tube feeds, decrease lantus to 2  units qhs
   and sliding scale.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a progressive decline due to pneumonia and altered mental status, leading to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He was reintubated and is currently in the ICU.
- The family recently changed the patient's code status to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) and wishes for comfort care. The goal is to keep the patient comfortable and provide palliative care.
- The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and requires intermittent sedation. The barrier to extubation is mainly the patient's mental status.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently well-controlled with a heart rate in the 80s. Metoprolol is being continued, and anticoagulation is held due to hematuria.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, chronic pancreatitis, erosive esophagitis, and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, increased creatinine levels, low potassium, and altered liver function tests.
- Potential medical complications that can arise include hypoglycemia, pneumonia due to aspiration, shock (hypovolemic or hemorrhagic), endocarditis, and delirium.

   Plan:
   Had a discussion with the family who had already determined with the
   team over the weekend that the patient would not want to continue
   mechanical ventilation if he were in this condition.  I explained that
   there is a possibility that we could diurese the patient and ultimately
   extubate but they point out that the patient has had a steady decline
   and this is just another event along a pathway that the patient would
   not want to be on.  Thus, patient was extubated and he died shortly
   after extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia. He underwent extubation and was transferred to the floor, but subsequently re-admitted on [**2171-3-3**] with a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was thought to be caused by recurrent aspiration.

The patient's medical history includes mantle and periaortic radiation therapy for NHL, as well as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. His current condition includes agitation, possible respiratory muscle weakness, and fluid overload from post-arrest resuscitation. He also has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled and anticoagulation is being held due to elevated INR. There are concerns about tricuspid valve dysfunction, but no immediate interventions are planned. The patient's goals of care, as per the family, are extubation and comfort care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary barrier to extubation appears to be agitation and possibly respiratory muscle weakness. Additionally, there is fluid overload from post-arrest resuscitation.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled, and anticoagulation is being held due to elevated INR.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who underwent mantle and periaortic radiation therapy, as well as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was initially admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure caused by aspiration pneumonia. He was extubated and transferred to the floor but had a subsequent readmission on [**2171-3-3**] with a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was thought to be hypoxemia from recurrent aspiration.

The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, sedatives, and respiratory support. His vital signs and lab results are provided in the note, showing some abnormalities such as low blood pressure, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal kidney function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary barrier to extubation appears to be agitation and possibly respiratory muscle weakness. Additionally, there is fluid overload from post-arrest resuscitation. Supportive management and possible change in goals of care should be considered.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is currently paced atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled. Anticoagulation is being held due to an elevated INR. Deferring anticoagulation should be considered along with a discussion about goals of care.
