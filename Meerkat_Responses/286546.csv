   Assessment and Plan
   1)Neuro/ID- altered mental status, likely hepatic encephalopathy plus
   ARF. Completing infectious workup, no s/o SBP. does have +UA, will
   follow up on that. Treating with Ctx for now, will hold Levo while he
   is on that. Continue lactulose/rifaximin.
   Has not had head CT- no focal deficit, so will hold off.
   2)Renal- prerenal vs. HRS, but improving with albumin and IVFs. holding
   diuretics.
   3)Liver- cirrhosis of unclear etiology, followed here by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. As
   above, cont Nadolol.
   4)Heme- anemia, thought due to known portal gastropathy. Received PRBC
   2Units overnight. Will follow labs for response. No clear active
   bleeding but will follow closely.
   5)Pulm- h/o IPF, not active currently.
   6)ICU- Full code, SQH, PPI

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, nausea, vomiting, elevated creatinine from baseline, and possible pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has been started on lactulose and a nasogastric tube (NGT) has been placed. Paracentesis was performed to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and cultures were obtained. Albumin has been initiated for possible hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient has received a blood transfusion for low hematocrit. Mental status has improved after removing the NGT and an arterial blood gas (ABG) shows respiratory alkalosis. The patient has been started on antibiotics for a positive urine analysis. The patient's allergies include adhesive-related issues such as skin tears. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Levofloxacin at 03:38 PM on [**2175-2-10**] and Ceftriaxone at 03:59 AM on [**2175-2-11**]. The patient is currently receiving prophylactic heparin sodium, albumin, rifaximin, lactulose, Carafate, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and nadolol. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and jaundice. The patient's flow sheet data shows vital signs within normal ranges,"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with PMH of cirrhosis and AMS, worsening renal failure, and
   anemia.
   .
   # AMS: Given history and complaints, most likely etiology is hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Other sources of delirium should be ruled out such as
   medications (none new) and infections.  Certainly, infection is a risk
   factor for worsening hepatic encephalopathy.  Peritoneal fluid is
   negative for SBP by WBCs.  GIB is also a risk factor and he has
   esophageal varices by history, though there is no history of BRBPR,
   melena, or hematemesis.  No other localizing source of infection.
   Blood loss suggests GI source especially given known portal
   gastropathy.  Slow improvement while in ICU.
   - NGT placed, lactulose 60 TID, titrate for BMs
   - Rifaximin
   - monitor ABG for worsening respiratory status

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis who was admitted for altered mental status (AMS). The patient underwent a paracentesis, which was negative for infection. He received albumin and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and his condition improved overnight. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 117/66 to 147/130 mmHg, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities. The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, worsening renal failure (possibly hepatorenal syndrome), cirrhosis, anemia, and iron overload.

The patient's treatment plan includes lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, rifaximin, volume resuscitation, albumin administration, and monitoring for worsening respiratory status. The patient also requires ongoing management for renal failure, anemia, portal gastropathy, and iron overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hepatic encephalopathy, development of hepatorenal syndrome, gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices or portal gastropathy, infections"

   encephalopathy.  Other sources of delirium should be ruled out such as
   medications (none new) and infections.  Certainly, infection is a risk
   factor for worsening hepatic encephalopathy.  Peritoneal fluid is
   negative for SBP by WBCs.  GIB is also a risk factor and he has
   esophageal varices by history, though there is no history of BRBPR,
   melena, or hematemesis.  No other localizing source of infection.
   Blood loss suggests GI source especially given known portal

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis, acute mental status changes (AMS), worsening renal failure, and anemia. He is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient's 24-hour events include unsuccessful nasogastric tube (NGT) placement, placement of a Dobhoff tube, growth of Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in blood culture, and initiation of vancomycin. The patient also has a sodium level of 147, for which intravenous (IV) dextrose water (D5W) is ordered.

The patient has allergies to adhesive and skin tears. His last doses of antibiotics were levofloxacin on 02/10/2175 at 03:38 PM, ceftriaxone on 02/11/2175 at 03:59 AM, and vancomycin on 02/11/2175 at 01:50 PM.

Infusions include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), and carafate (sucralfate). Other medications include changes to medical and family history, review of systems unchanged from admission except as noted below, and flowsheet data as of 02/12/2175 at 07:47 AM.

Vital signs include temperature (Tmax: 36.7°C, Tcurrent: 36.4°C), heart rate (HR: 90 bpm), blood pressure (BP: 115/49 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR: 16 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (SpO2: 99%). Hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid intake of 2,679 mL, total fluid output of 2,085 mL, and urine output of 2,085 mL. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery, with an ABG result of /20/.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment (right radial pulse: not assessed), left radial pulse: not assessed), right distal pulse (RDP pulse: not assessed), and left distal pulse (LDP pulse: not assessed). Skin, neurologic, and other systems assessments were also not performed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 196 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 8.2 g/dL, sodium (Na+) level of 154 mg/dL, potassium (K+) level of 1.4 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.5 mg/dL, total bilirubin (TBili) level of 24.2%, and other lab values listed.

Assessment and plan include AMS likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, worsening renal failure with concern for hepatorenal syndrome, cirrhosis with unknown etiology, anemia likely secondary to portal gastropathy, and other conditions"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis, who is currently experiencing altered mental status (AMS) and worsening renal failure. He also has anemia and is positive for coag-negative Staphylococcus in blood cultures, which could precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has esophageal varices by history, but there is no current evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells due to anemia and has shown slight improvement. 

Assessment and Plan:

   bacteremia.
   Has not had head CT- no focal deficit and overall improving, so will
   hold off.
   2)Renal- prerenal- but improved with albumin and IVFs. holding
   diuretics.
   3)Liver- cirrhosis of unclear etiology, followed here by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 416**]. As
   above, cont Nadolol.
   4)Heme- anemia, thought due to known portal gastropathy. Received PRBC
   2Units on admission, Hct now stable. Will follow labs for response. No
   clear active bleeding but will follow closely.
   5)Pulm- h/o IPF, not active currently.
   6)FEN- hypercalcemia, check PTH, ?underlying malignancy. will give IVFs
   and follow. check SPEP/UPEP.
   7)ID-GPC in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] follow up ID/sensi. Cont Vanc. check TTE.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is in the ICU with an altered mental status.
- The patient has a history of cirrhosis of unclear etiology and is being followed by Dr. [Last Name (Title)].
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and abnormal kidney function.
- The patient has anemia due to portal gastropathy and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on admission.
- The patient has a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is currently not active.
- The patient has hypercalcemia and may have an underlying malignancy.
- The patient is being treated for GPC infection with vancomycin and will follow up with ID/sensitivity.
- The patient's code status is full code.
- The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's abnormal kidney function may indicate an AKI, which can be caused by various factors such as dehydration or medication toxicity.
3. Infection: The patient's bacteremia and GPC infection suggest the possibility of a systemic infection, which can lead to seps"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with PMH of cirrhosis and AMS, worsening renal failure, and
   anemia.
   # AMS: Given history and complaints, most likely etiology is hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Also has coag neg staph in 2 BCx which could
   precipitate hepatic encephalopathy.  BCx since have been negative.  Had
   a positive UA, but UCx negative.  Now with ? pna on CXR, on vanc
   zosyn.  Paracentesis fluid NGTD and did not meet criteria for SBP by
   WBC.  GIB is also a risk factor and he has esophageal varices by
   history, though there is no history of BRBPR, melena, or hematemesis.
   He is anemic, required 2U pRBCs shortly after [**Year (4 digits) 4298**].  Continued
   improvement in MS [**First Name (Titles) 4059**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4298**] with Lactulose.  Now taking PO and ok
   for diet with thickened liquids per s/s.
   - lactulose 60 TID PO, titrate for BMs
   - Rifaximin
   - infectious workup and continue antbiotics for bacteremia and ? pna,
   though could be pulm edema as he has been afebrile and his WBC is
   trending down.  Cont to cover with vanc/zosyn for now.  Will need to
   restart levo home prophylactic dose when zosyn is stopped.
   - follow anemia as below
   .
   # bacteremia: GPCs in blood. Antibiotics as above.
   - cont vanc
   - ECHO for vegetations
   .
   # Renal failure: initially concerning for hepatorenal syndrome.  Fena
   0.4 suggesting prerenal component.  Has responded to albumin and fluid,
   so not likely hepatorenal.  Near baseline but worsened yesterday to
   today.  Decreased UOP this AM.
   - albumin 50g today and prn
   - careful with volume resuscitation given possibility for volume
   overload
   - avoid diuretics if possible
   - follow
   .
   # cirrhosis: unknown etiology though autoimmune thought likely with
   iron overload.  Liver following.
   - tx of hepatic encephalopathy and possible hepatorenal syndrome as
   above
   - cont nadolol
   .
   # Hypernatremia:
   - careful d5W repletion
   .
   # Anemia: known portal gastropathy.  HCT trending down here.  Guaiac
   positive, though no gross blood/melena.  No suggestion of large
   variceal bleed. Received 2U pRBCs upon [**Last Name (Titles) 4298**].  Roughly stable.
   - maintain type and screen
   - maintain IV access
   - transfuse pRBCs for HCT < 21
   - PM HCT
   - if significant drop, must consider variceal bleed as possible cause.
    .
   # Hypercalcemia: unclear cause.  Has known liver lesion, ? mets.  Also,
   with anemia, renal failure, and hypercalcemia, multiple myeloma is a
   consideration

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis, presenting with acute mental status changes (AMS), worsening renal failure, and anemia. The patient's current condition includes hepatic encephalopathy, coag-negative staph bacteremia, possible pneumonia, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) risk due to esophageal varices. The patient has received lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and is showing improvement. Antibiotics have been administered for bacteremia and potential pneumonia coverage. The patient's renal failure initially raised concerns for hepatorenal syndrome but has responded well to albumin and fluid resuscitation, suggesting a prerenal cause. Further evaluation is needed for the underlying cause of the cirrhosis, which is of unknown etiology but may be autoimmune-related. The patient's hypernatremia should be carefully managed with d5W repletion. Anemia is present, and the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and maintaining IV access are necessary. If there is a significant drop in hemoglobin, consideration should be given to a variceal bleed. The patient's hypercalcemia requires further investigation, and multiple myeloma is a consideration given the patient's age, renal failure, anemia, and liver lesion. Additional tests such as SPEP/UPEP, PTH, and electrolyte monitoring are recommended. The patient's idi"

   68 yo male with PMH of cirrhosis and AMS, worsening renal failure, and
   anemia.
   # AMS: Given history and complaints, most likely etiology is hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Also has coag neg staph in 2 BCx which could

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of cirrhosis, acute mental status changes (AMS), worsening renal failure, and anemia. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's AMS may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver cirrhosis. The presence of coag-negative staph in his blood cultures could also contribute to this condition.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive urine antigen test for LLL PNA, indicating a possible infection. He is already on vancomycin and Zosyn, broad-spectrum antibiotics, to cover for bacteremia and potential pneumonia.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's renal function has worsened, initially concerning for hepatorenal syndrome. However, he has responded to albumin and fluid administration, suggesting it may not be hepatorenal in origin.
4. Esophageal varices: As the patient has a history of esophageal varices, there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), which could lead to significant bleeding and hemodynamic instability.
5. Anemia: The patient is anemic and received 2 units of packed red blood cells. Monitoring his hemoglobin levels and transfusing as needed is important to prevent further complications.
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient has"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and acute mental status changes (AMS). The patient has worsening renal failure, anemia, hypercalcemia, and possible multiple myeloma. There are also concerns about potential medical complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), infective endocarditis (IE), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and portal gastropathy.

The patient has been started on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, rifaximin, and prophylactic antibiotics. They have also been given albumin and Lasix for hypercalcemia. The plan includes following up on anemia, renal failure, cirrhosis, hypercalcemia, and potential multiple myeloma.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a decline in brain function that occurs as a result of severe liver disease. It can cause AMS and other neurological symptoms.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of esophageal varices and portal gastropathy, which are risk factors for GIB. Symptoms may include melena (black, tarry stools), hematemesis (vomiting blood), and hypotension.
3. Infective endocarditis (IE): The patient has bacteremia with gram-positive cocci, which raises the suspicion for IE."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis admitted for a change in mental status. He has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and pneumonia. The patient's condition appears to be improving overall but remains ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition is caused by liver dysfunction and can lead to confusion, disorientation, and altered mental status. It is associated with high levels of ammonia in the blood.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has new bibasilar infiltrates on the chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory symptoms such as cough, fever, and shortness of breath.

3. Bacteremia: The patient had coag-negative staph bacteremia, which means bacteria from this species were present in the blood. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection or sepsis.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has ecchymoses (bruises) and jaundice, suggesting impaired skin integrity. This could be related to liver disease or other underlying conditions.

5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function has improved with albumin administration. Monitoring kidney function and maintaining adequate hydration is crucial.

6. Hypercalcemia: The patient has an elevated calcium level. Further investigation and management are required to address this electrolyte imbalance.
