","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of laminectomy, diabetes mellitus type II, Sjogren's syndrome, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, and vasculitis. She presented to the hospital with sepsis and was found to have purulent drainage from her spinal wound. She was started on dexamethasone, cefepime, and flagyl. The patient's lactate level was elevated, and she required intubation. She was transferred to the ICU, where she was weaned off levophed. 

24-hour events include the removal of antibiotics (metronidazole), pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient received vancomycin and Tylenol as well. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of fatigue. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 105/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.20. 

Physical examination findings include a warm back with a 7-inch midline incision that is open in some spots, draining. The patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person. Her extremities are 1+ bilaterally, and she is unable to stand. 

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.0 g/dL, hemoglobin of 6.4 g/dL, platelet count of 216 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 20 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, sodium of 132 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, and glucose of 204 mg/dL. Other labs indicate an elevated PT/INR and low magnesium level. 

Assessment and plan include septicemia likely originating from the wound, wound infection, acute renal failure likely prerenal, a syncopal episode, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, anemia, and pain control. The patient is also on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient's wound is draining purulent material, indicating a possible infection. This could lead to further systemic infection and complications if not properly managed.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline, indicating possible renal dysfunction. This could be due to prerenal causes such as hypoperfusion secondary to sepsis or intrinsic renal damage. Monitoring fluid balance and kidney function closely is essential.
3. Septicemia: The patient's elevated lactate level and presence of sepsis suggest a systemic infection. If not treated promptly, it could lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is on prophylaxis, the use of central venous catheters and immobilization due to her condition increase her risk of developing DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and surveillance for signs of DVT are necessary.
5. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's shortness of breath and hypoxia could be due to a PE. If persistent, further evaluation, including imaging studies, may be required.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level may indicate anemia. Further investigation into the cause and appropriate management is needed."

","Summary:
The patient is a somnolent, obese female with a history of multiple medical conditions including constipation, pain control, obesity, hardware infection, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, electrolyte and fluid disorder, diabetes mellitus type II, fever, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and DVT prophylaxis. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU, including antibiotics, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there are concerns regarding the presence of a wound infection at the site of a lower spinal incision, characterized by erythema, induration, fluctuance, and purulent discharge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient's symptoms of erythema, induration, fluctuance, and purulent discharge suggest a possible wound infection at the site of the lower spinal incision. This could lead to further complications such as abscess formation, systemic infection, and potentially require surgical intervention.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of a wound infection indicate a potential risk for sepsis. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential to prevent progression to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization in the ICU may increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, and autoimmune vasculitis. She was admitted to the ICU from the emergency department after experiencing a fall with fever and hypotension. The patient underwent laminectomy and foraminotomy surgery, but developed septic shock likely due to an infection at the surgical wound site. She also has a possible bacteremia. Her initial assessment revealed somnolence, poor dentition, tachycardia, and diffuse abdominal tenderness with voluntary guarding, particularly in the right lower quadrant. A 7 cm incisional wound on her back showed erythema, induration, and fluctuance with purulent discharge. The patient's neurological examination was limited due to her inability to cooperate fully. She is currently on mechanical ventilation via a nasal cannula with oxygen saturation at 97%. Her laboratory results indicate acute renal failure, hyponatremia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lactate levels. An MRI of the spine is planned to rule out a deeper wound infection. The patient's fever and hypotension have improved with ongoing antibiotic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Surgical wound abscess: The presence of erythema, induration, and fluctuance around the incision site suggests a superficial wound infection. However, given the patient's recent lamin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, and autoimmune vasculitis. She was admitted to the ICU from the emergency department after falling and presenting with fever and hypotension. The likely source of infection is an abscess at her spine wound, with possible seeding of the blood causing bacteremia. Initial chest CT was unremarkable, and urine analysis was negative. She is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole. Blood and urine cultures are pending. An MRI of the lumbar spine is planned to rule out a deeper wound infection. The patient may have experienced a syncopal episode during her fall, but other causes such as myocardial infarction, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, or cerebrovascular accident cannot be ruled out. She is also experiencing abdominal pain without obvious acute pathology on CT abdomen/pelvis. She has a surgical wound abscess being followed by the neurosurgery/spine service, and an MRI of the spine will be done to rule out deeper infection. Her mental status is likely secondary to underlying infection and compounded by electrolyte abnormalities including acute renal failure and hyponatremia. She has anemia with a decreased hemoglobin level, unknown baseline. There is no obvious source of bleeding. Her diabetes is being managed with a sliding scale of Humalog insulin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of a draining back wound. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and unknown allergies. They have received various antibiotics, including metronidazole, vancomycin, and cefipime. The patient is on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other medications as well. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below. 

Vital signs show a maximum temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 61-91 bpm, blood pressure between 93/43 mmHg and 138/76 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,891 mL, including 242 mL of intravenous fluids. Output includes 900 mL of urine, 1,540 mL of blood products, and 195 mL of other outputs. 

Respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula with oxygen delivery and an ABG reading of ///23/. 

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and others. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (248 K/uL), hemoglobin (8.5 g/dL), glucose (174 mg/dL), creatinine (1.1 mg/dL), and potassium (4.4 mEq/L). Other lab values are within normal range. 

Assessment and plan include constipation, pain control, obesity, hardware infection, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, electrolyte & fluid disorder, diabetes mellitus type II, fever, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and others. 

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications may include:
1. Infection: The patient has a draining back wound and is at risk for infection. There is also a mention of hardware infection related to a VP shunt.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. Proper management is crucial to prevent the progression to septic shock.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which may indicate hypotension. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's lab results show abnormal levels of potassium, sodium, and chloride. Close monitoring and correction of these imbalances are necessary.
5. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's glucose level is elevated, indicating a potential diabetes-related complication.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity,"

   and hypotension.
   # Fever/Hypotension:
   On initial presentation to OSH consistent with septic shock. Likely
   source is infection at surgical wound with possible seeding of the
   blood to cause bacteremia. Chest CT at OSH was unremarkable. UA neg.
   Has since had blood cultures with two out of two bottles positive for
   gram positive cocci in clusters.

   aureus.
   - Follow-up blood culture speciation and sensitivities
   # ?Syncope:
   Clarified with patient and her husband and found that there was not a
   syncopal episode after all. Regardless, head CT from here was read as
   no acute intracranial pathology.
   # Abdominal pain:
   Denies abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. She was notably tender on
   exam at admission, mostly at RLQ. CT abd/pelvis at admission showed no
   intra-abdominal pathology. Is less tender today. [**Month (only) 11**] have been related
   to constipation.
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   # Surgical wound abscess:
   Being followed by neurosurgery/spine service. MRI with artifact
   obscuring the imaging of the spinal canal at L3 to S1 level by MRI. No
   spinal abscess or abnormal enhancement from T12 to L2.  As patient has
   markedly improved with antibiotics in last 24 hours, they may not take
   her to the OR for washout of the wound.
   - Await neurosurgery eval in the afternoon to determine if surgery is
   necessary
   - Continue Vancomycin and Cefepime
   # Delirium:

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, and autoimmune vasculitis. She was admitted to the ICU after falling and experiencing fever and hypotension. She underwent laminectomy and foraminotomy, and subsequently developed a draining back wound. The patient presented to the emergency department with fever and hypotension, which were consistent with septic shock. The likely source of infection was identified as the surgical wound, with possible seeding of the blood causing bacteremia. Blood cultures showed two out of two bottles positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters.

The patient's condition has improved with antibiotics, but she still exhibits some complications. These include abdominal pain, surgical wound abscess, delirium, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune vasculitis, fibromyalgia/chronic pain, and fibromyalgia/chronic pain.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/43-138/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on 2 liters nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. The patient is alert and oriented, with no signs of distress or discomfort."
