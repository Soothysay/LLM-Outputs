   Assessment and Plan
   #altered mental status
 pt became adamant about wanting to leave AMA
   overnight.  Ambulance was called but refused to transport patient
   home.  Psych was consulted but pt refused capacity evaluation and was
   thus determined to not have capacity. Per wife, pt with h/o
   schizophrenia and psychotic disorder, with frequent episodes of leaving
   hospital AMA.
   - psych recommends serum and urine tox screens
   - psych also recommending 5mg haldol, 2mg ativan, 1mg cogentin IV for
   agitation
   - psych consult/liaison attending will see patient later this morning
   - continue ziprasidone and trazodone
   # dyspnea
 pt still very wheezy on exam.  Pt subjectively says that
   his dyspnea is improving.  No longer on BiPAP (used it very briefly
   during the night).  Had an episode of sats dropping to 70
s during the
   night when he took off BiPAP and stoof up to use the restroom.
   - will continue albuterol/atrovent nebs PRN (increased to q4hr PRN
   yesterday) and advair [**Hospital1 **]
   - pt has not gotten any lasix since yesterday, but pt
s I/O
s are -3.5L
   over 24 hrs
   - hold off on antibiotics as no leukocytosis, no significant sputum
   production per RT, and no fever presently.
   - pt still on methylprednisolone IV
 transition to PO steroids today
   - continue 1.2L fluid restriction and low salt diet.
   .
   # hyponatremia - likely [**2-15**] volume overload.  improved slightly with
   diuresis (114->117->119 ->121->121).  no obvious intracranial process
   based on neuro exam.  no obvious intrathoracic malignancy, though has
   extensive smoking history.  at present alert, answers questions, and
   follows commands.
   - sodium had increased to 121 by yesterday afternoon
   - this morning
s sodium still pending.  Will f/u
   .
   # DM - continue SSI here.  on novolin 90U QAM at home per wife, per
   pharmacy closest analog would be 70/30, so will split dose [**Hospital1 **] for now
   and add humalog SSI.
   - trend FSBS on steriods.
   - diabetic diet.
   .
   # CHF - s/p AVR in [**2134**] (metal valve, st. [**Male First Name (un) **], @ [**Hospital1 12**] x2).  currently
   volume up.  most likely [**2-15**] dietary and fluid restriction
   non-compliance.  current weight is 142 kg (314 lb), and dry weight is
   ~270 lbs.
   - pt
s I/O
s down 3.5L from yesterday.  Pt only received on dose of
   Lasix yesterday.
   - hold off on further lasix for now and see if pt continues to diurese
   - daily weights, strict i/o's, low salt diet.
   - fluid restrict to 1.2L.
   - CE x 1
 Tn was negative and CPK was below 100
   - obtain OSH records from cardiologist at [**Hospital3 **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7275**].
   - dig level still pending
   - coumadin level has been adjusted [**2-15**] to azithromycin
   .
   # COPD - per wife, on 2L NC at home, but has been using 5L NC for past
   week [**2-15**] dyspnea.  unclear why he is not on standing inhaled steroid.
   although his clinical history is more consistent with CHF exacerbation,
   his modest BNP argues against this, and he remains fairly roncherous on
   exam, so will treat for both COPD and CHF as follows:
   - continue albuterol PRN and adavir [**Hospital1 **]
   - currently on azithromycin and ceftriaxone
 coumadin level has been
   adjusted [**2-15**] azithromycin
    .
   # lower extremity skin changes
   - wound care [**Name8 (MD) 77**] rn.
   - continue Lidex to legs [**Hospital1 **]
   - keep LE elevated.
   . .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete lytes prn, cardiac, diabetic diet.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of heart failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), schizophrenia, and previous aortic valve replacement. He was admitted to the ICU due to dyspnea and altered mental status. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure of 146/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, but has been adamant about leaving against medical advice (AMA) multiple times. He was given 120mg of Lasix this morning and his fluid restriction has been increased to 1.2 liters. The patient's recent lab results show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 119 mEq/L, elevated blood glucose levels, and mildly elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient's transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function, right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis, and normal functioning aortic valve prosthesis. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 30%. The patient's current medications include warfarin, furosemide, aspirin, lisinopril, diltiazem, trazodone, and geodon. The patient's family history is significant for schizophrenia and psychotic disorder.

Potential medical complications:
1. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and fluid overload suggest a possible exacerbation of heart failure. His elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level also supports this possibility.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and current wheezing on examination raise the possibility of a COPD exacerbation. His use of BiPAP and need for increased albuterol/atrovent nebs indicate respiratory distress.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium level requires careful management to prevent complications such as seizures or cerebral edema.
4. Diabetic complications: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
5. Infection: The patient's chronic venous stasis changes and skin breakdown put him at risk for developing pressure ulcers or cellulitis.
6. Psychiatric complications: The patient's history of schizophrenia and previous episodes of leaving the hospital AMA suggest the possibility of psychiatric complications, including agitation or non-compliance with treatment.
7. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization and history of heart failure increase his risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, hyponatremia, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient has been on BiPAP and tolerating oxygen via nasal cannula. His diet has been advanced to a soft mechanical/low sodium diet. He received 120mg of Lasix this morning and his warfarin dosage was reduced to 5mg daily due to an interaction with azithromycin. The patient was initially adamant about leaving against medical advice (AMA) but eventually agreed to stay and revisit in the morning. His wife was present and also wanted him to leave AMA. On-call psych was contacted and evaluated the patient for capacity. The patient refused the evaluation and was deemed not to have capacity. Psych recommended administering haloperidol IV, lorazepam IV, and cogentin IV PRN for agitation. The attending physician will round on the patient in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and current respiratory support indicate an increased risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) for an infection, which increases the risk of developing further infections.

   # dyspnea
No longer on BiPAP (used it very briefly during the night).
   Had an episode of sats dropping to 70
s during the night when he took
   off BiPAP and stoof up to use the restroom.  Dyspnea is likely
   multifactorial, with a COPD exacerbation component and a CHF
   component.  Each will be addressed individually.
   # COPD
 pt will having dyspnea and wheezing on exam.
   - will continue albuterol/atrovent nebs PRN (increased to q4hr PRN
   yesterday) and advair [**Hospital1 **]

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and schizophrenia, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient's medical history includes an AVR in 2013 (metal valve) and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The patient is on various medications including BiPAP, albuterol/atrovent nebs, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, methylprednisolone, Lasix, warfarin, and psychotropic medications.

24-hour events include an episode of sats dropping to 70s when the patient removed BiPAP to use the restroom. The patient's wife was at the bedside and expressed concern about the patient's capacity. Psych was consulted, but the patient refused evaluation. The patient's Coumadin level has been adjusted due to azithromycin interaction.

   Assessment and Plan
   # dyspnea - etiology unclear, but by clinical history, sounds most
   consistent with CHF exacerbation (progressive increasing dyspnea, with
   weight gain from ~270->314 lb, dietary and fluid non-compliance).
   however, his JVP is difficult to discern on exam [**2-15**] habitus, his BNP
   is relatively low, and his lung exam is notable for bilateral wheezing,
   but also considerable ronchi suggestive of a component of COPD.
   although PE remains on the differential, his lack of significant
   hypoxia, and alternative explanation on CXR make this less likely.
   will proceed as follows:
   - continue albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - transition to oral steroids in morning.
   - start advair given has known COPD on home O2, unclear why not on
   medication list.
   - check BNP.
   - diurese with lasix 120mg iv prn UOP < 100cc/hr.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes during diuresis.
   - hold off on antibiotics as no leukocytosis, no significant sputum
   production per RT, and no fever presently.
   - check DFA, although afebrile now, and symptoms appear to have started
   2 weeks ago, but pt is poor historian.
   - continue BiPaP overnight, with plan for wean in AM.
   - GOAL O2 90-92%, wean FiO2 to keep O2 <92%.
   - cycle cardiac enzymes.
   - TTE in AM.
   - 1.2L fluid restriction.
   - low salt diet.
   .
   # hyponatremia - likely [**2-15**] volume overload.  improved slightly with
   diuresis (114->117->119).  no obvious intracranial process based on
   neuro exam.  no obvious intrathoracic malignancy, though has extensive
   smoking history.  at present alert, answers questions, and follows
   commands.
   - hold off on hypertonic saline for now.
   - check urine lytes, osm, serum osm to evaluate for SIADH.
   - diurese as above and trend sodium.
   - check TSH.
   .
   # DM - continue SSI here.  on novolin 90U QAM at home per wife, per
   pharmacy closest analog would be 70/30, so will split dose [**Hospital1 **] for now
   and add humalog SSI.
   - trend FSBS on steriods.
   - diabetic diet.
   .
   # CHF - s/p AVR in [**2134**] (metal valve, st. [**Male First Name (un) **], @ [**Hospital1 12**] x2).  currently
   volume up.  most likely [**2-15**] dietary and fluid restriction
   non-compliance.  current weight is 142 kg (314 lb), and dry weight is
   ~270 lbs.
   - diurese as above.
   - daily weights, strict i/o's, low salt diet.
   - fluid restrict to 1.2L.
   - TTE in AM.
   - cycle CE, and treat with aspirin until rules out.
   - continue lisinopril.
   - unclear why he is not on a beta-blocker, but will continue diltiazem
   in divided doses so it can be titrated up for goal HR 60s.
   - obtain OSH records from cardiologist at [**Hospital3 **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7275**] in AM.
   - hold coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, goal 2.5-3.5 for mechanical
   aortic valve (confirm with cardiologist in AM).
   - check digoxin level.
   .
   # COPD - per wife, on 2L NC at home, but has been using 5L NC for past
   week [**2-15**] dyspnea.  unclear why he is not on standing inhaled steroid.
   although his clinical history is more consistent with CHF exacerbation,
   his modest BNP argues against this, and he remains fairly roncherous on
   exam, so will treat for both COPD and CHF as follows:
   - start advair [**Hospital1 **].
   - continue albuterol/atrovent nebs/mdi per RT.
   - check sputum culture.
   - check urine legionella.
   - transition to oral prednisone 60mg in AM.
   - hold off on abx given lack of leukocytosis, fever, would consider
   levo or azithro for anti-inflammatory but levoquin interferes with INR,
   and azithromycin can exacerbate hyponatremia.
   .
   # lower extremity skin changes - no erythema, but +warmth.  more
   consisent with chronic venous changes presently, though does have some
   areas of skin breakdown which are at risk for infection.
   - wound care [**Name8 (MD) 77**] rn.
   - diurese as above.
   - hold off on antibiotics for now, and discuss in AM.
   - teds stockings.
   - keep LE elevated.
   .
   # psych - per wife, pt with h/o schizophrenia and psychotic disorder,
   with frequent episodes of leaving hospital AMA.
   - continue home regimen of trazadone 600mg po qhs, geodone 80mg [**Hospital1 **].

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, CHF, COPD, DM, and AVR. He presented to the ICU with dyspnea, weight gain, and a possible exacerbation of CHF or COPD. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has hyponatremia, which is likely due to volume overload. His BNP is relatively low, suggesting that the dyspnea may not be solely attributed to CHF. The patient has a history of non-compliance with dietary and fluid restrictions, which could have contributed to his current condition. He also has lower extremity skin changes consistent with chronic venous insufficiency and some areas of skin breakdown at risk for infection. The patient's psych history includes frequent episodes of leaving the hospital against medical advice. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Exacerbation of CHF: The patient's symptoms, such as dyspnea and weight gain, could indicate a worsening of his congestive heart failure. Close monitoring of his fluid status and diuresis will be necessary.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and the presence of bilateral wheezing and ronchi on lung examination suggest a possible exacerbation of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Treatment with bronchodilators and steroids may be required.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need to be corrected carefully to avoid complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   #altered mental status
 pt became adamant about wanting to leave AMA
   overnight.  Ambulance was called but refused to transport patient
   home.  Psych was consulted but pt refused capacity evaluation and was
   thus determined to not have capacity.
   - psych recommends serum and urine tox screens
   - psych also recommending 5mg haldol, 2mg ativan, 1mg cogentin IV for
   agitation
   - psych consult/liaison attending will see patient later this morning
   # dyspnea
 improving, with pt not longer on BiPAP
   - will continue albuterol/atrovent nebs PRN (increased to q4hr PRN
   yesterday) and advair [**Hospital1 **]
   - transition to oral steroids in morning.
   - check BNP.
   - diurese with lasix 120mg iv prn UOP < 100cc/hr.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes during diuresis.
   - hold off on antibiotics as no leukocytosis, no significant sputum
   production per RT, and no fever presently.
   - check DFA, although afebrile now, and symptoms appear to have started
   2 weeks ago, but pt is poor historian.
   - continue BiPaP overnight, with plan for wean in AM.
   - GOAL O2 90-92%, wean FiO2 to keep O2 <92%.
   - cycle cardiac enzymes.
   - TTE in AM.
   - 1.2L fluid restriction.
   - low salt diet.
   .
   # hyponatremia - likely [**2-15**] volume overload.  improved slightly with
   diuresis (114->117->119).  no obvious intracranial process based on
   neuro exam.  no obvious intrathoracic malignancy, though has extensive
   smoking history.  at present alert, answers questions, and follows
   commands.
   - hold off on hypertonic saline for now.
   - check urine lytes, osm, serum osm to evaluate for SIADH.
   - diurese as above and trend sodium.
   - check TSH.
   .
   # DM - continue SSI here.  on novolin 90U QAM at home per wife, per
   pharmacy closest analog would be 70/30, so will split dose [**Hospital1 **] for now
   and add humalog SSI.
   - trend FSBS on steriods.
   - diabetic diet.
   .
   # CHF - s/p AVR in [**2134**] (metal valve, st. [**Male First Name (un) **], @ [**Hospital1 12**] x2).  currently
   volume up.  most likely [**2-15**] dietary and fluid restriction
   non-compliance.  current weight is 142 kg (314 lb), and dry weight is
   ~270 lbs.
   - diurese as above.
   - daily weights, strict i/o's, low salt diet.
   - fluid restrict to 1.2L.
   - TTE in AM.
   - cycle CE, and treat with aspirin until rules out.
   - continue lisinopril.
   - unclear why he is not on a beta-blocker, but will continue diltiazem
   in divided doses so it can be titrated up for goal HR 60s.
   - obtain OSH records from cardiologist at [**Hospital3 **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7275**] in AM.
   - hold coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, goal 2.5-3.5 for mechanical
   aortic valve (confirm with cardiologist in AM).
   - check digoxin level.
   .
   # COPD - per wife, on 2L NC at home, but has been using 5L NC for past
   week [**2-15**] dyspnea.  unclear why he is not on standing inhaled steroid.
   although his clinical history is more consistent with CHF exacerbation,
   his modest BNP argues against this, and he remains fairly roncherous on
   exam, so will treat for both COPD and CHF as follows:
   - start advair [**Hospital1 **].
   - continue albuterol/atrovent nebs/mdi per RT.
   - check sputum culture.
   - check urine legionella.
   - transition to oral prednisone 60mg in AM.
   - hold off on abx given lack of leukocytosis, fever, would consider
   levo or azithro for anti-inflammatory but levoquin interferes with INR,
   and azithromycin can exacerbate hyponatremia.
   .
   # lower extremity skin changes - no erythema, but +warmth.  more
   consisent with chronic venous changes presently, though does have some
   areas of skin breakdown which are at risk for infection.
   - wound care [**Name8 (MD) 77**] rn.
   - diurese as above.
   - hold off on antibiotics for now, and discuss in AM.
   - teds stockings.
   - keep LE elevated.
   .
   # psych - per wife, pt with h/o schizophrenia and psychotic disorder,
   with frequent episodes of leaving hospital AMA.
   - continue home regimen of trazadone 600mg po qhs, geodone 80mg [**Hospital1 **].

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of CHF, COPD, diabetes, and psychiatric disorders, who was admitted to the ICU due to acute decompensated heart failure and respiratory distress. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 146/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently on BiPAP for sleep, and their activity has been advanced to out-of-bed chair activities.

The patient's laboratory results show normal WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for hyponatremia. The cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and the echocardiogram reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic function, right ventricular cavity enlargement, and normal functioning aortic valve prosthesis.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's main issues include altered mental status, dyspnea, hyponatremia, diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The plan includes continuing BiPAP, weaning FiO2 to keep O2 <92%, advancing to CPAP/PSV mode, and cycling cardiac"

He will continue 1.2L fluid restriction and low salt diet. Continue to monitor daily"

   Assessment and Plan
   # dyspnea - etiology unclear, but by clinical history, sounds most
   consistent with CHF exacerbation (progressive increasing dyspnea, with
   weight gain from ~270->314 lb, dietary and fluid non-compliance).
   however, his JVP is difficult to discern on exam [**2-15**] habitus, his BNP
   is relatively low, and his lung exam is notable for bilateral wheezing,
   but also considerable ronchi suggestive of a component of COPD.
   although PE remains on the differential, his lack of significant
   hypoxia, and alternative explanation on CXR make this less likely.
   will proceed as follows:
   - continue albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - transition to oral steroids in morning.
   - start advair given has known COPD on home O2, unclear why not on
   medication list.
   - check BNP.
   - diurese with lasix 120mg iv prn UOP < 100cc/hr.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes during diuresis.
   - hold off on antibiotics as no leukocytosis, no significant sputum
   production per RT, and no fever presently.
   - check DFA, although afebrile now, and symptoms appear to have started
   2 weeks ago, but pt is poor historian.
   - continue BiPaP overnight, with plan for wean in AM.
   - GOAL O2 90-92%, wean FiO2 to keep O2 <92%.
   - cycle cardiac enzymes.
   - TTE in AM.
   - 1.2L fluid restriction.
   - low salt diet.
   .
   # hyponatremia - likely [**2-15**] volume overload.  improved slightly with
   diuresis (114->117->119).  no obvious intracranial process based on
   neuro exam.  no obvious intrathoracic malignancy, though has extensive
   smoking history.  at present alert, answers questions, and follows
   commands.
   - hold off on hypertonic saline for now.
   - check urine lytes, osm, serum osm to evaluate for SIADH.
   - diurese as above and trend sodium.
   - check TSH.
   .
   # DM - continue SSI here.  on novolin 90U QAM at home per wife, per
   pharmacy closest analog would be 70/30, so will split dose [**Hospital1 **] for now
   and add humalog SSI.
   - trend FSBS on steriods.
   - diabetic diet.
   .
   # CHF - s/p AVR in [**2134**] (metal valve, st. [**Male First Name (un) **], @ [**Hospital1 12**] x2).  currently
   volume up.  most likely [**2-15**] dietary and fluid restriction
   non-compliance.  current weight is 142 kg (314 lb), and dry weight is
   ~270 lbs.
   - diurese as above.
   - daily weights, strict i/o's, low salt diet.
   - fluid restrict to 1.2L.
   - TTE in AM.
   - cycle CE, and treat with aspirin until rules out.
   - continue lisinopril.
   - unclear why he is not on a beta-blocker, but will continue diltiazem
   in divided doses so it can be titrated up for goal HR 60s.
   - obtain OSH records from cardiologist at [**Hospital3 **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7275**] in AM.
   - hold coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, goal 2.5-3.5 for mechanical
   aortic valve (confirm with cardiologist in AM).
   - check digoxin level.
   .
   # COPD - per wife, on 2L NC at home, but has been using 5L NC for past
   week [**2-15**] dyspnea.  unclear why he is not on standing inhaled steroid.
   although his clinical history is more consistent with CHF exacerbation,
   his modest BNP argues against this, and he remains fairly roncherous on
   exam, so will treat for both COPD and CHF as follows:
   - start advair [**Hospital1 **].
   - continue albuterol/atrovent nebs/mdi per RT.
   - check sputum culture.
   - check urine legionella.
   - transition to oral prednisone 60mg in AM.
   - hold off on abx given lack of leukocytosis, fever, would consider
   levo or azithro for anti-inflammatory but levoquin interferes with INR,
   and azithromycin can exacerbate hyponatremia.
   .
   # lower extremity skin changes - no erythema, but +warmth.  more
   consisent with chronic venous changes presently, though does have some
   areas of skin breakdown which are at risk for infection.
   - wound care [**Name8 (MD) 77**] rn.
   - diurese as above.
   - hold off on antibiotics for now, and discuss in AM.
   - teds stockings.
   - keep LE elevated.
   .
   # psych - per wife, pt with h/o schizophrenia and psychotic disorder,
   with frequent episodes of leaving hospital AMA.
   - continue home regimen of trazadone 600mg po qhs, geodone 80mg [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete lytes prn, cardiac, diabetic diet.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and subsequent deterioration in his mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains on supplemental oxygen and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).

The patient has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to dietary and fluid non-compliance. His weight has increased from 270 lbs to 314 lbs, and his B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is relatively low. He also has hyponatremia, which is likely secondary to volume overload. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and is currently on insulin therapy.

The patient's lower extremity skin changes are consistent with chronic venous insufficiency, but there are areas of skin breakdown at risk for infection. His mental status has fluctuated, and he has been agitated and refusing to cooperate with evaluations. He has a history of leaving the hospital against medical advice (AMA).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress: The patient presented with acute respiratory distress, which may be due to an exacerbation of CHF or COPD. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.

2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can lead to"

   although his clinical history is more consistent with CHF exacerbation,
   his modest BNP argues against this, and he remains fairly roncherous on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), and skin changes in the lower extremities. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute exacerbation of COPD with respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, acute decompensated heart failure, and hyperglycemia.

24-hour events include:
- EKG and Transthoracic Echo performed.
- The patient was taken off BiPAP and tolerating oxygen via nasal cannula.
- Advanced diet to soft mechanical/low sodium (2g) Heart Healthy/ Diabetic diet.
- Administered 120mg of Lasix in the morning.
- Warfarin dosage reduced to 5mg daily due to azithromycin interaction.
- Activity advanced to out-of-bed chair position.
- BiPAP used for sleep.
- Patient's wife contacted ambulance service, but they refused transport.
- Patient eventually agreed to stay and revisit in the morning.
- Psychiatric consultation was requested due to the patient's adamant wish to leave against medical advice (AMA).
- Psychiatric evaluation was performed, and the patient was deemed not to have the capacity to make medical decisions.
- Medications administered include Lasix, warfarin, haldol, ativan, cogentin, methylprednisolone IV, PO steroids,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

24-hour events include an EKG and a trans-thoracic echo, which revealed a large hypokinetic right ventricular free wall, moderate mitral regurgitation, and relatively normal left ventricular ejection fraction. The patient experienced agitation overnight and asked to leave against medical advice (AMA), but was redirected. Psychiatric consultation was requested.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 99 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 131/65 mmHg to 181/84 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Flowsheet data shows a weight of 141.7 kg, fluid intake of 1,349 mL including 552 mL of intravenous fluids, and fluid output of 4,810 mL with a negative balance of 3,461 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 320 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 40 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 29.4 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) of -3.9 mEq/L.

Physical examination findings include general somnolence but arousable, dry oropharynx with lacrimation near the left ear, clear lungs with bilateral expiratory wheezes, obesity with non-tender abdomen, severe chronic venous stasis changes with a stable 1 cm ulcer in the right leg, and neurologic status of somnolence but able to wake up.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 3.5-3.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 31.9-29.4%, platelet (Plt) count of 100-108 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7-0.9 mg/dL, troponin-T level of <0.01 ng/mL, blood glucose levels ranging from 103-241 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (CHF), hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and schizophrenia. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress, likely a combination of COPD exacerbation and CHF. The patient has been experiencing dyspnea, wheezing, and agitation. His vital signs are stable, but he has leukopenia, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and hyponatremia. He is currently receiving various medications and treatments for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's respiratory distress and symptoms such as dyspnea and wheezing indicate an ongoing exacerbation of his COPD. If not properly managed, this could lead to further respiratory failure and potential complications like pneumonia or respiratory arrest.
2. CHF: The patient's symptoms and history suggest a component of CHF exacerbation. If not addressed appropriately, it may lead to worsening fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and cardiac dysfunction.
3. Agitation and Psychiatric Issues: The patient's agitation and history of schizophrenia and psychotic disorder pose a risk of self-harm or harm to others. Proper management and close monitoring are essential to prevent any adverse events.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels need careful management to avoid complications like seizures, neurological dysfunction, or cardiac arrhythmias"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 144/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and other medications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's history of COPD with acute exacerbation puts him at risk for respiratory infections, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and obesity increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias.
3. Infectious Complications: The patient's immunocompromised state due to diabetes and altered mental status may increase the risk of infections, including urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and sepsis.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status could progress to delirium or coma, which may be caused by infections, metabolic imbalances, or hypoxia.
5. Metabolic Complications: The patient's poorly controlled blood glucose levels indicate a risk of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyper"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and a history of schizophrenia and psychotic disorder. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, likely due to a combination of COPD exacerbation and congestive heart failure (CHF).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. COPD exacerbation: The patient is experiencing dyspnea and wheezing, which are symptoms of a COPD exacerbation. This can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. CHF: The patient's symptoms, such as dyspnea and fluid overload, suggest the possibility of CHF. If left untreated, it can progress to cardiogenic shock.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his blood pressure is currently elevated. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to further cardiovascular complications.

4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's blood glucose levels are running high, indicating poor glycemic control. This increases the risk of diabetic complications, such as infection and poor wound healing.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which can result in neurological symptoms. If not corrected, it may lead to seizures or other serious complications.

6. Lower extremity skin changes: The patient has chronic venous stasis changes and multiple areas of drainage. These skin changes increase the risk"

","The patient is an obese male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus. He presented to the ICU with respiratory distress, and his vital signs upon admission included a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 156/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on nasal cannula. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics (azithromycin and ceftriaxone), steroids (medrol and prednisone), and nebulizers.

Based on the progress note, the patient's condition has been fluctuating. There are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing acute exacerbation. The mixed picture of right heart failure, some left heart failure, and COPD exacerbation may require further interventions such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support.

2. HypoNa (Hyponatremia): The patient has low sodium levels, which could be due to total body volume overload but low effective circulatory volume. The rising trend with diuresis should be closely monitored.

3. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes, and it needs to be managed with appropriate medication and glycemic control.

4. Anticoagulation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient's allergies include a last dose of antibiotics (Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone) on 07-08-2145. The patient has been receiving various infusions and medications in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxemia. The patient has been experiencing fluid overload with a total input of 1,120 mL and output of 3,385 mL since 12 AM. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 88%. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, hypertension, hyponatremia, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be attributed to mixed respiratory failure due to right heart failure, left heart failure, and acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient's severe right ventricular dysfunction and overload seen on the echo further support this complication.

2. HypoNa (Hyponatremia): The patient's low sodium levels could be a result of total body volume overload but with low effective circulatory volume. The rising sodium levels with diuresis indicate that the hyponatremia"

   48M with h/o COPD, CHF s/p AVR, admitted with progressive dyspnea, tx
   with steroids/diuresis, transferred back to MICU for increased dyspnea,
   tachypnea, and bleeding.
   .
   # dyspnea/tachypnea - pt was being treated for copd flare, and chf
   exacerbation prior to call-out to medical floor.  now returns, after
   increased agitation on the floor, followed by O2 desaturation, with
   progression of bilateral infiltrates c/w edema on CXR, though
   concerning for superimposed alveolar hemmorhage given PTT>150, and
   copious blood secretions, although secretions may be entirely from
   oropharyngeal trauma during intubation.  he received lasix iv 120mg x1
   and morphine iv 2mg x1 on floor, and continues to produce vigorous
   urine output.  Patient with continued bloody secretions from ETT.
   - broadened abx empirically to vanco/zosyn.
   - continue steroids taper
 60mg solumedrol IV x 1 today, then switch
   to prednisone tomorrow
   - sputum cx.
   - d/w anesthesia stability of ET tube as there is ongoing question of
   valve leakage, which may necessitate replacing tube.  Cuff leak this
   AM.  Will revisit exchanging ETT today during the day, but in light of
   rising INR would hold off if possible due to risk of bleeding.
   # hypotension - most likely [**2-15**] repeated sedation boluses (propofol,
   fentanyl, versed), and this has now resolved, with patient requiring
   transient dosing of levophed based on sedation needs. Continued blood
   loss also contributing but Pt has been transfused 3 units over 24hrs
   and 4^th unit has been ordered.  ddx also includes sepsis, and
   cardiogenic shock.   Surgery evaluated Pt and does not believe surgical
   pathology present.
   - broaden abx with vanc/zosyn.
   - Continue monitoring HCT
   - Maintain MAP>60, for goal CVP >8.
   - maintain T&C.
   - quad-lumen, and 2 PIVs in place.
   - wean propfol, favor fent/versed.
   .
   # bleeding - profuse bleeding during intubation, likely oropharyngeal
   trauma.  Also with dark maroon aspirated from OGT, which has
   subsequently cleared to bile.  Most likely [**2-15**] trauma in the setting of
   superimposed supratherapeutic PTT.  DDx also includes DIC.
   - DIC labs were negative as panel however low haptoglobin
 likely
   associated with mechanical heart valve
   - Monitor HCT.
   - if continues to have profuse oral secretions consider ENT consult.
   - hold off on reversing anticoagulation with FFP/cryo for now given his
   mechanical aortic valve, and keep up with blood loss by transfusing
   pRBC PRN.  If blood loss becomes acutely worse reverse with FFP and
   avoid using Vit K if possible.
   - Will continue to transfuse to keep up with blood loss
   # DM - continue SSI.  on novolin 90U QAM at home per wife, per pharmacy
   closest analog would be 70/30, so will split dose [**Hospital1 **] for now and add
   humalog SSI.
   - trend FSBS on steriods.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and a mechanical aortic valve. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea, treated for COPD flare and CHF exacerbation, and then transferred back to the MICU due to increased dyspnea, tachypnea, and bleeding.
- The patient received Lasix IV and morphine on the floor, and continues to produce vigorous urine output. He has continued bloody secretions from the ETT.
- Broadened abx empirically to vanco/zosyn.
- Sputum cx unable to be processed. Will not collect another at this time due to [**2-15**] bleeding.
- Spoke with Anesthesia Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4731**] [**Numeric Identifier 7364**] regarding pilot balloon. Given that the ETT cuff is not leaking, they recommend leaving the tube in place and if it becomes problematic, they will come and swap out the tube.
- PT/INR rising. The patient received a total of 10mg of Warfarin on [**7-9**], continues to have blood from the ETT, and requires pressors. Ordered for third unit of pRBC.
- Will need to recheck Ca after next unit and replete if necessary. Corrected Ca was 8.7 prior to the third unit.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and a mechanical aortic valve who presented with progressive dyspnea and was admitted to the MICU. The patient was treated for a COPD flare-up and CHF exacerbation but returned with increased dyspnea, tachypnea, and bleeding. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition is critical, and the medical team has broadened antibiotic coverage to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient has received three units of packed red blood cells and a fourth unit has been ordered due to ongoing blood loss. The patient's INR is rising, and there is ongoing concern for bleeding, which may be due to oropharyngeal trauma during intubation or superimposed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90's/50' to 115/59mmHg, respiratory rate at 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.4 degrees Celsius.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral rales, minimal wheezing, regular heart rhythm, and distended abdomen with a firm region in the epigastrium. There are also signs of venous stasis changes and radials bilaterally.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits, and cardiac markers are negative.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Dyspnea/Tachypnea: The patient's bilateral infiltrates suggest fluid overload, possibly due to CHF exacerbation. The patient has received Lasix and morphine on the floor, but continues to produce vigorous urine output. Broadened antibiotic coverage has been initiated.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension likely due to repeated sedation boluses, blood loss, sepsis, or cardiogenic shock. Levophed has been used transiently, and the patient has been transfused with three units of packed red blood cells with a fourth unit ordered.
3. Bleeding: The patient had profuse bleeding during intubation, which is likely oropharyngeal trauma. There is also dark maroon aspirated from the OGT, but this is likely oral secretions. The differential diagnosis includes trauma, superimposed supratherapeutic PTT, or DIC.
4. DM: The patient's diabetes management is ongoing, with insulin supplementation and splitting of the morning dose.
5. CHF: The patient's CHF exacerbation is being managed with diuretics, strict intake/output measurements, and dietary restrictions.

   with steroids/diuresis, transferred back to MICU for increased dyspnea,
   tachypnea, and bleeding.
   .
   # dyspnea/tachypnea - pt was being treated for copd flare, and chf
   exacerbation prior to call-out to medical floor.  now returns, after
   increased agitation on the floor, followed by O2 desaturation, with
   progression of bilateral infiltrates c/w edema on CXR, though
   concerning for superimposed alveolar hemmorhage given PTT>150, and
   copious blood secretions, although secretions may be entirely from
   oropharyngeal trauma during intubation.  he received lasix iv 120mg x1
   and morphine iv 2mg x1 on floor, and continues to produce vigorous
   urine output.  Patient with continued bloody secretions from ETT.
   - broadened abx empirically to vanco/zosyn.
   - continue steroids taper
 60mg solumedrol IV x 1 today, then switch
   to prednisone tomorrow
   - sputum cx.
   - d/w anesthesia stability of ET tube as there is ongoing question of
   valve leakage, which may necessitate replacing tube.  Cuff leak this
   AM.  Will revisit exchanging ETT today during the day.
   # hypotension - most likely [**2-15**] repeated sedation boluses (propofol,
   fentanyl, versed), and this has now resolved, with patient requiring
   transient dosing of levophed based on sedation needs. Continued blood
   loss also contributing but Pt has been transfused 3 units over 24hrs
   and 4^th unit has been ordered.  ddx also includes sepsis, and
   cardiogenic shock.   Surgery evaluated Pt and does not believe surgical
   pathology present.  Lactate trended back down to 1.7 from high of 3.4
   - broaden abx with vanc/zosyn.
   - Continue monitoring HCT
   - Maintain MAP>60, for goal CVP >8.
   - maintain T&C.
   - protonix gtt.
   - quad-lumen, and 2 PIVs in place.
   - wean propfol, favor fent/versed.
   .
   # bleeding - profuse bleeding during intubation, likely oropharyngeal
   trauma.  Also with dark maroon aspirated from OGT.  Feel this likely
   represents oral secretions, as HCT has been largely stable, and no
   frank melena.  Most likely [**2-15**] trauma in the setting of superimposed
   supratherapeutic PTT.  DDx also includes DIC.
   - DIC labs were negative as panel however low haptoglobin
 likely
   associated with mechanical heart valve
   - Monitor HCT.
   - continue PPI gtt for now.
   - if continues to have profuse oral secretions consider ENT consult.
   - hold off on reversing anticoagulation with FFP/cryo for now given his
   mechanical aortic valve, and keep up with blood loss by transfusing
   pRBC PRN.
   # DM - continue SSI.  on novolin 90U QAM at home per wife, per pharmacy
   closest analog would be 70/30, so will split dose [**Hospital1 **] for now and add
   humalog SSI.
   - trend FSBS on steriods.

   # CHF - s/p AVR in [**2134**] (metal valve, st. [**Male First Name (un) **], @ [**Hospital1 12**] x2).  currently
   volume up.
   - hold diuretics.
   - daily weights, strict i/o's, low salt diet.
   - fluid restrict to 1.2L.
   - hold lisinopril, diltiazem.
   - hold heparin gtt/coumadin for now.
   .
   # COPD - on 2L NC at home, roncherous and tight with wheezing on
   initial MICU exam, now less wheezy.
   - continue albuterol/atrovent nebs/mdi, hold spiriva.
   - continue solumedrol iv 125mg q8hr.
   - broaden abx as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and schizophrenia. He was admitted to the ICU for progressive dyspnea, treated with steroids and diuretics, and then transferred back to the MICU for increased dyspnea, tachypnea, and bleeding.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, bleeding, and CHF. He underwent an endoscopy on [**2145-7-10**] and is currently intubated with a pilot balloon issue. His Hct is low, and he has received three units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) with a fourth unit ordered. He continues to have bloody secretions from the endotracheal tube (ETT).

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate. His potassium and magnesium levels are low, and his calcium level is slightly low as well. His PT/INR is elevated, indicating a potential bleeding risk.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. His respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at "

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus. On admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/42 mmHg to 141/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a volume control mode, set at a tidal volume of 500 mL and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. FiO2 has been maintained at 50% and PEEP at 12 cmH2O. ABG results show pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 58 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 190.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with hemoglobin levels ranging from 26.5% to 29.0%, leukopenia with white blood cell count of 4.2 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with platelet count of 98 K/uL. Blood cultures have been drawn and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,899 mL and output of 1"

   Assessment and Plan
   48M with h/o COPD, CHF s/p AVR, admitted with progressive dyspnea, tx
   with steroids/diuresis, transferred back to MICU for increased dyspnea,
   tachypnea, and bleeding.
   # dyspnea/tachypnea - pt was being treated for copd flare, and chf
   exacerbation prior to call-out to medical floor.  now returns, after
   increased agitation on the floor, followed by O2 desaturation, with
   progression of bilateral infiltrates c/w edema on CXR, though
   concerning for superimposed alveolar hemmorhage given PTT>150, and
   copious blood secretions, although secretions may be entirely from
   oropharyngeal trauma during intubation.  he received lasix iv 120mg x1
   and morphine iv 2mg x1 on floor, and continues to produce vigorous
   urine output.  Patient with continued bloody secretions from ETT.
   - broadened abx empirically to vanco/zosyn.
   - continue steroids taper
 60mg solumedrol IV x 1 today, then switch
   to prednisone tomorrow
   - sputum cx.
   - d/w anesthesia stability of ET tube as there is ongoing question of
   valve leakage, which may necessitate replacing tube.  Cuff leak this
   AM.  Will revisit exchanging ETT today during the day, but in light of
   rising INR would hold off if possible due to risk of bleeding.
   # hypotension - most likely [**2-15**] repeated sedation boluses (propofol,
   fentanyl, versed), and this has now resolved, with patient requiring
   transient dosing of levophed based on sedation needs. Continued blood
   loss also contributing but Pt has been transfused 3 units over 24hrs
   and 4^th unit has been ordered.  ddx also includes sepsis, and
   cardiogenic shock.   Surgery evaluated Pt and does not believe surgical
   pathology present.
   - broaden abx with vanc/zosyn.
   - Continue monitoring HCT
   - Maintain MAP>60, for goal CVP >8.
   - maintain T&C.
   - quad-lumen, and 2 PIVs in place.
   - wean propfol, favor fent/versed.
   .
   # bleeding - profuse bleeding during intubation, likely oropharyngeal
   trauma.  Also with dark maroon aspirated from OGT, which has
   subsequently cleared to bile.  Most likely [**2-15**] trauma in the setting of
   superimposed supratherapeutic PTT.  DDx also includes DIC.
   - DIC labs were negative as panel however low haptoglobin
 likely
   associated with mechanical heart valve
   - Monitor HCT.
   - if continues to have profuse oral secretions consider ENT consult.
   - hold off on reversing anticoagulation with FFP/cryo for now given his
   mechanical aortic valve, and keep up with blood loss by transfusing
   pRBC PRN.  If blood loss becomes acutely worse reverse with FFP and
   avoid using Vit K if possible.
   - Will continue to transfuse to keep up with blood loss
   # DM - continue SSI.  on novolin 90U QAM at home per wife, per pharmacy
   closest analog would be 70/30, so will split dose [**Hospital1 **] for now and add
   humalog SSI.
   - trend FSBS on steriods.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD and CHF who was admitted for progressive dyspnea, treated with steroids and diuretics, and then transferred back to the MICU for increased dyspnea, tachypnea, and bleeding. He is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has several ongoing issues including hypotension, bleeding, and potential complications such as sepsis, cardiogenic shock, DIC, and chronic venous changes in the lower extremities. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his Hct is low, indicating anemia. His ABG results show a slightly alkalotic pH and elevated bicarbonate levels. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and normal liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, including fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, could be indicative of an infection.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of CHF and current presentation with hypotension and tachypnea, there is a possibility of cardiogenic shock.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The presence of bleeding, low platelet count, and prolonged PTT suggests the possibility of DIC.
4. Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI): The patient's lower extremity skin changes may be due to CV"

   Assessment and Plan
   48M with h/o COPD, CHF s/p AVR, admitted with progressive dyspnea, tx
   with steroids/diuresis, transferred back to MICU for increased dyspnea,
   tachypnea, and bleeding requiring intubation w/ upper airway bleeding
   in setting of anticoagulation for mechanical valve.
   # dyspnea/tachypnea/acute respiratory failure
 pt was being treated
   for copd flare, and chf exacerbation prior to call-out to medical
   floor.  now returns, after increased agitation on the floor, followed
   by O2 desaturation, with progression of bilateral infiltrates c/w edema
   on CXR, though concerning for superimposed alveolar hemmorhage given
   PTT>150, and copious blood secretions, although secretions may be
   entirely from oropharyngeal trauma during intubation.  he received
   lasix iv 120mg x1 and morphine iv 2mg x1 on floor, and continues to
   produce vigorous urine output.  Patient with continued bloody
   secretions from ETT.  DDX includes COPD flare vs aspiration of blood vs
   pulm edema vs pulm hemorrhage.
   - tolerating inc PEEP and reduction in FIO2
   - broadened abx empirically to vanco/zosyn.
   - continue steroids taper
 60mg solumedrol IV x 1 today, then switch
   to prednisone tomorrow
   - will defer bronch at this time
   - sputum cx.
   - d/w anesthesia stability of ET tube as there is ongoing question of
   valve leakage, which may necessitate replacing tube.  Cuff leak this
   AM.  Will revisit exchanging ETT today during the day, but in light of
   rising INR would hold off if possible due to risk of bleeding.
   # hypotension - most likely [**2-15**] repeated sedation boluses (propofol,
   fentanyl, versed), and this has now resolved, with patient requiring
   transient dosing of levophed based on sedation needs. Continued blood
   loss also contributing but Pt has been transfused 3 units over 24hrs
   and 4^th unit has been ordered.  ddx also includes sepsis, and
   cardiogenic shock.   Surgery evaluated Pt and does not believe surgical
   pathology present.
   - broaden abx with vanc/zosyn.
   - Continue monitoring HCT
   - Maintain MAP>60, for goal CVP >8.
   - maintain T&C.
   - quad-lumen, and 2 PIVs in place.
   - wean propfol, favor fent/versed.
   .
   # bleeding - profuse bleeding during intubation, likely oropharyngeal
   trauma.  Also with dark maroon aspirated from OGT, which has
   subsequently cleared to bile.  Most likely [**2-15**] trauma in the setting of
   superimposed supratherapeutic PTT.  DDx also includes DIC.
   - EGD with no bleeding source
   - has been transfused 4U pRBC in past 48 hrs
   - DIC labs were negative as panel however low haptoglobin
 likely
   associated with mechanical heart valve
   - Monitor HCT.
   - if continues to have profuse oral secretions consider ENT consult.
   - hold off on reversing anticoagulation with FFP/cryo for now given his
   mechanical aortic valve, and keep up with blood loss by transfusing
   pRBC PRN.  If blood loss becomes acutely worse reverse with FFP and
   avoid using Vit K if possible.
   - Will continue to transfuse to keep up with blood loss
   - INR rising, hold coumadin
   # DM - continue SSI.  on novolin 90U QAM at home per wife, per pharmacy
   closest analog would be 70/30, so will split dose [**Hospital1 **] for now and add
   humalog SSI.
   - trend FSBS on steriods.

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypotension. He has a history of COPD, hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and a recent episode of left ear trauma. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. His vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 98/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has been receiving multiple units of blood transfusion due to ongoing blood loss, and his hemoglobin concentration has improved from 24.9% to 29.0%. He is also receiving antibiotics (azithromycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin) and analgesics (fentanyl and midazolam). The patient's abdominal examination reveals a markedly distended abdomen with a firm region in the epigastrium, possibly indicating an intra-abdominal injury or bleeding. There are no signs of rebound tenderness or guarding. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 4.2 K/uL and elevated troponin-T levels, suggesting possible myocardial injury.

   with steroids/diuresis, transferred back to MICU for increased dyspnea,
   tachypnea, and bleeding requiring intubation w/ upper airway bleeding
   in setting of anticoagulation for mechanical valve.

 pt was being treated
   for copd flare, and chf exacerbation prior to call-out to medical
   floor.  now returns, after increased agitation on the floor, followed
   by O2 desaturation, with progression of bilateral infiltrates c/w edema
   on CXR, though concerning for superimposed alveolar hemmorhage given
   PTT>150, and copious blood secretions, although secretions may be
   entirely from oropharyngeal trauma during intubation.  he received
   lasix iv 120mg x1 and morphine iv 2mg x1 on floor, and continues to
   produce vigorous urine output.  Patient with continued bloody
   secretions from ETT.  DDX includes COPD flare vs aspiration of blood vs
   pulm edema vs pulm hemorrhage.
   - tolerating inc PEEP and reduction in FIO2
   - broadened abx empirically to vanco/zosyn.

   - d/w anesthesia stability of ET tube as there is ongoing question of
   valve leakage, which may necessitate replacing tube.  Cuff leak this
   AM.  Will revisit exchanging ETT today during the day, but in light of
   rising INR would hold off if possible due to risk of bleeding.
   # hypotension - most likely [**2-15**] repeated sedation boluses (propofol,
   fentanyl, versed), and this has now resolved, with patient requiring
   transient dosing of levophed based on sedation needs. Continued blood
   loss also contributing but Pt has been transfused 3 units over 24hrs
   and 4^th unit has been ordered.  ddx also includes sepsis, and
   cardiogenic shock.   Surgery evaluated Pt and does not believe surgical
   pathology present.
   - broaden abx with vanc/zosyn.
   - Continue monitoring HCT
   - Maintain MAP>60, for goal CVP >8.
   - maintain T&C.
   - quad-lumen, and 2 PIVs in place.
   - wean propfol, favor fent/versed.

   # bleeding - profuse bleeding during intubation, likely oropharyngeal
   trauma.  Also with dark maroon aspirated from OGT, which has
   subsequently cleared to bile.  Most likely [**2-15**] trauma in the setting of
   superimposed supratherapeutic PTT.  DDx also includes DIC.
   - EGD with no bleeding source
   - has been transfused 4U pRBC in past 48 hrs
   - DIC labs were negative as panel however low haptoglobin
 likely
   associated with mechanical heart valve
   - Monitor HCT.
   - if continues to have profuse oral secretions consider ENT consult.
   - hold off on reversing anticoagulation with FFP/cryo for now given his
   mechanical aortic valve, and keep up with blood loss by transfusing
   pRBC PRN.  If blood loss becomes acutely worse reverse with FFP and
   avoid using Vit K if possible.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and mechanical aortic valve, who was admitted with progressive dyspnea. The patient underwent intubation due to increased agitation and O2 desaturation. The patient continues to produce bloody secretions from the ETT, and there are concerns about aspiration of blood, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, or COPD flare. The patient's INR is rising, and they have received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells over the past 48 hours. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 98/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. The patient's lungs show bilateral rales with minimal wheezing. The abdomen is markedly distended with firmness in the epigastrium. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.2 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 29.0%, and low platelet count of 98 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for elevated potassium levels. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, bleeding, and potential complications such as sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or disseminated intr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus. He presented to the ICU with altered mental status, hypotension, and bloody secretions from an endotracheal tube (ETT). The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in his blood pressure and hemoglobin levels. However, he continues to have bloody secretions, and his arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a slightly elevated pH indicating alkalosis. The patient's white blood cell count is low, indicating leukopenia. His renal function tests are within normal limits, but his liver enzymes are slightly elevated. The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal, with low sodium and potassium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's condition may lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation, which can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Bleeding complications: The presence of bloody secretions from the ETT suggests ongoing bleeding. This can lead to further blood loss and potentially result in hypotension and shock.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating inadequate tissue perfusion. This can compromise organ function and increase the risk of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
4. Infection: The patient's leukopenia (low white blood cell count)"

   Assessment and Plan
   48M with h/o COPD, CHF s/p AVR, admitted with progressive dyspnea, tx
   with steroids/diuresis, transferred back to MICU for increased dyspnea,
   tachypnea, and bleeding requiring intubation w/ upper airway bleeding
   in setting of anticoagulation for mechanical valve.
   # dyspnea/tachypnea/acute respiratory failure
 pt was being treated
   for copd flare, and chf exacerbation prior to call-out to medical
   floor.  now returns, after increased agitation on the floor, followed
   by O2 desaturation, with progression of bilateral infiltrates c/w edema
   on CXR, though concerning for superimposed alveolar hemmorhage given
   PTT>150, and copious blood secretions, although secretions may be
   entirely from oropharyngeal trauma during intubation.  he received
   lasix iv 120mg x1 and morphine iv 2mg x1 on floor, and continues to
   produce vigorous urine output.  Patient with continued bloody
   secretions from ETT.  DDX includes COPD flare vs aspiration of blood vs
   pulm edema vs pulm hemorrhage.
   - tolerating inc PEEP and reduction in FIO2
   - will try PSV mode
   - broadened abx empirically to vanco/zosyn.  Will treat for total 7
   days.
   - continue steroids taper
 60mg solumedrol IV x 1 today, then switch
   to prednisone tomorrow.  Cont MDI.
   - sputum cx.
   - d/w anesthesia stability of ET tube as there is ongoing question of
   valve leakage, which may necessitate replacing tube.  Cuff leak this
   AM.  Will revisit exchanging ETT today during the day, but in light of
   rising INR would hold off if possible due to risk of bleeding.
   # hypotension - most likely [**2-15**] repeated sedation boluses (propofol,
   fentanyl, versed), and this has now resolved, with patient requiring
   transient dosing of levophed based on sedation needs. Continued blood
   loss also contributing but Pt has been transfused 3 units over 24hrs
   and 4^th unit has been ordered.  ddx also includes sepsis, and
   cardiogenic shock.   Surgery evaluated Pt and does not believe surgical
   pathology present.
   - broaden abx with vanc/zosyn.
   - Continue monitoring HCT
   - Maintain MAP>60, for goal CVP >8.
   - maintain T&C.
   - quad-lumen, and 2 PIVs in place.
   - wean propfol, favor fent/versed.
   .
   # bleeding - profuse bleeding during intubation, likely oropharyngeal
   trauma.  Also with dark maroon aspirated from OGT, which has
   subsequently cleared to bile.  Most likely [**2-15**] trauma in the setting of
   superimposed supratherapeutic PTT.
   - EGD with no bleeding source
   - has been transfused 4U pRBC in past 48 hrs
   - DIC labs were negative as panel however low haptoglobin
 likely
   associated with mechanical heart valve
   - Monitor HCT.
   - if continues to have profuse oral secretions consider ENT consult.
   - hold off on reversing anticoagulation with FFP/cryo for now given his
   mechanical aortic valve, and keep up with blood loss by transfusing
   pRBC PRN.  If blood loss becomes acutely worse reverse with FFP and
   avoid using Vit K if possible.
   - Will continue to transfuse to keep up with blood loss
   - INR 3.3, hold coumadin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and mechanical valve replacement. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and treated with steroids and diuretics. The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to intubation due to upper airway bleeding while on anticoagulation for the mechanical valve. 

Current vital signs show a blood pressure of 94/45 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and respiratory system compliance of 55. 

Physical examination reveals obesity, fair air movement, faint expiratory wheezing, and 3+ edema. Neurological examination shows the patient opens his eyes to voice but quickly falls asleep. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, slightly elevated creatinine level, and normal platelet count. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic severe COPD, Pickwickian syndrome, and CHF. He was switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) today. There is a concern about cuff leak, and if the patient appears to be doing well on PSV, a tube change may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and mechanical valve replacement. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and treated with steroids and diuretics. The patient developed increased dyspnea, tachypnea, and bleeding while on anticoagulation therapy for the mechanical valve. He required intubation due to upper airway bleeding.

Current vital signs show a blood pressure of 94/45 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode. His temperature is 37.2 C (98.9 F) and current temperature is 36.6 C (97.8 F). The patient has fair air movement with faint expiratory wheezing.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures are pending. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic severe COPD, Pickwickian syndrome, and CHF increase the risk for respiratory failure. The patient was switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) today. The healthcare team should monitor for cuff leak and consider changing the endotracheal tube if the patient appears to be doing"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a mechanical valve. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and treated with steroids and diuretics. The patient's condition worsened, leading to intubation due to upper airway bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation for the mechanical valve.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 15 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The spontaneous respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute with a Vt of 447-541 mL.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 74 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 94/45 mmHg to 129/63 mmHg, temperature (T) ranging from 36.6°C to 37.2°C, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 96%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 20 mmHg, and his fluid balance shows an input of 2,295 mL, output of 1,347 mL, and a net balance of 948 mL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill obese male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and anemia. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypotension, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, pulmonary edema, leukopenia, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, hypertension, hyponatremia, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/53 to 129/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and sedated but responds to voice commands. Physical examination findings include fair air movement with faint expiratory wheeze, 3+ edema, and opening of eyes to voice but quickly falling asleep.

Laboratory results show a low white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit levels, low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, normal glucose level, and altered electrolyte levels including hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia. Imaging studies such as X-rays are mentioned but not detailed in the provided information.

The patient's assessment and plan include several potential medical complications. These include respiratory failure due to severe COPD exacerbation,"

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic severe COPD and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. There is a plan to switch to pressure support ventilation (PSV) to facilitate weaning off mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to sepsis-induced hypotension. The plan is to wean off norepinephrine and monitor mean arterial pressure (MAP) to maintain between 60-65 mmHg.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels are dropping, indicating acute anemia. The possible sources of bleeding include pulmonary edema and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.

4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has hyponatremia (low sodium) and other electrolyte imbalances. Fluid balance is also a concern, with ongoing fluid administration and losses.

5. Pulmonary edema: The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema, which could be secondary to heart failure or fluid overload.

6. Leukopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or bone marrow suppression.

7. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, but it is not specified whether it is delirium or another form of cognitive impairment.

8. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to prolonged immobility or pressure ulcers.

9. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation: The patient has a known history of COPD, and there is an acute exacerbation of the disease.

10. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, although it is described as benign.

11. Obesity: The patient is obese, which may contribute to their overall medical complexity.

12. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information. It is important to closely monitor and manage these conditions to ensure the patient's well-being."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old obese male with multiple medical complications. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and anemia.

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, hypertension, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus. He is intubated and sedated, with fair air movement and faint expiratory wheeze in his chest. He also has 3+ edema in his extremities.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/53 to 129/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 22 mmHg, and his urine output is 764 mL in the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 5.2 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 100. Other lab values indicate electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia (potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L) and hyponatremia (sodium level of 120 mEq/L). Additionally, the patient has elevated levels of lactate acid and C-reactive protein.

The patient's assessment and plan include electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypotension, anemia secondary to blood loss, pulmonary edema, leukopenia, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation, further decline in kidney function, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization, infection from prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures, and complications related to the patient's diabetes mellitus.

The patient's critical illness requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory status, fluid balance, electrolyte disturbances, and ongoing evaluation of his blood counts. Prompt intervention is necessary to prevent further complications and improve the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and mechanical aortic valve. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and treated with steroids and diuretics. The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to intubation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition and treatment include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has Pickwickian physiology and severe COPD/CHF, which puts him at risk for respiratory failure. He has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) successfully, indicating improvement. However, there is a possibility of reintubation if he does not tolerate extubation or if his respiratory status worsens.

2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with sepsis-induced hypotension, but it seems to have resolved as he is now off vasopressor support. However, close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status should be maintained to ensure early detection of any hypotensive episodes.

3. Anemia: The patient had a drop in hemoglobin concentration, which may be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes. Although this issue has resolved, monitoring of hemoglobin levels should continue to detect any new developments.

4. Mechanical aortic valve: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve, and maintaining appropriate anticoagulation"

   48 y/o M with h/o COPD, CHF s/p AVR, admitted with progressive dyspnea,
   tx with steroids/diuresis, transferred back to MICU for increased
   dyspnea, tachypnea, requiring intubation.
   1.       Respiratory failure: pt with Pickwickian physiology, as well
   as chronic severe COPD/CHF.  Has been on PSV 5/5 SBT all night.
   Oxygenating and ventilating well.  Dropped his FIO2 to 40%.  Will
   attempt extubation this AM, now that he has passed his SBT and has been
   diuresing well (-1.5 L overnight) with lasix gtt overnight.  Complete
   course of Vanco/Zosyn for HAPx 7 days.  Continue steroid taper.  Cont
   MDI.
   2.       Hypotension: primary dx was SIRS.  Pt has been source negative
   (blood, urine, sputum).  Off levophed with good MAPs.  Good UOP.
   3.       Anemia: previous HCT drop with high PTT, with ? GIB, now
   resolved.  EGD without bleeding source.
   4.       Mechanical aortic valve: INR was below 2.5 and heparin bridge
   was started.  INR 1.7 and PTT subtherapeutic this AM. Heparin scale
   made slightly more aggressive this AM.
   5.       Lower extremity skin changes and ear/facial wound - no
   erythema to LE, but +warmth.  more consisent with chronic venous
   changes presently, though does have some areas of skin breakdown which
   are at risk for infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and mechanical aortic valve. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and treated with steroids and diuretics. The patient required intubation due to increased dyspnea and tachypnea. He has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with spontaneous breaths all night and is oxygenating and ventilating well. The patient's FIO2 was successfully reduced to 40%. He will attempt extubation this morning, as he has passed his spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and has been diuresing well with lasix overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition may worsen if there is a decrease in oxygenation or ventilation, leading to further deterioration in lung function.
2. Hypotension: Aggressive diuresis and potential hypovolemia due to fluid loss could contribute to low blood pressure, which may compromise tissue perfusion.
3. Anemia: Although the patient's HCT drop has resolved, ongoing blood loss or decreased production could lead to anemia, affecting oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue oxygenation.
4. Mechanical aortic valve: Inadequate anticoagulation or thrombus formation on the valve could result in mechanical complications such as valve thrombosis or embolism.
5. Lower extremity skin changes and ear/facial wound: Chronic ven"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD and CHF who was admitted for progressive dyspnea. He was treated with steroids and diuretics, but his condition worsened, and he required intubation. The patient has been on PSV mode and successfully weaned off supplemental oxygen. He passed a spontaneous breathing trial and is ready for extubation. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 129/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and a temperature of 36.6°C. The patient has mild edema in the extremities and fair air movement in the chest. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to COPD/CHF, hypotension, anemia, mechanical aortic valve, and lower extremity skin changes. He also has a history of schizophrenia and psychotic disorder. The plan is to continue steroid taper, complete the course of antibiotics, and provide ongoing monitoring and care in the ICU. Potential complications that can arise include respiratory distress, infection, bleeding, and further deterioration of the patient's cardiac function."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old obese male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/49-138/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 21 mmHg, total input of 2,576 mL, and total output of 3,900 mL. His fluid balance is negative by 1,324 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, lansoprazole, warfarin, and furosemide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD may lead to ongoing respiratory failure. The RSBI (rapid shallow breathing index) is currently 31, which is below the desired threshold of 100 for weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 107/49-138/64 mmHg. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill obese male with respiratory failure, likely secondary to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and pulmonary edema. The patient has been intubated and sedated but is responsive to voice. Vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated central venous pressure. The patient has a history of hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic COPD. Lab results indicate anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated inflammatory markers. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation and pulmonary edema put him at risk for ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and ongoing management with mechanical ventilation is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension may resolve, but there is still a need to closely monitor and manage blood pressure, particularly during the weaning of vasopressors and the titration of fluid administration.
3. Anemia: The drop in hematocrit (HCT) suggests acute blood loss, possibly from the pulmonary edema or gastrointestinal bleeding. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of bleeding.
4. Coagulopathy: The elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR) indicate coagulopathy. Close monitoring of co"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and a mechanical aortic valve. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and received treatment with steroids and diuretics. The patient required intubation due to increased dyspnea and tachypnea. He was extubated successfully without difficulty and is currently oxygenating well on 4L NC. The patient has completed a full course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He is on a steroid taper and continues nebulizer treatments. 

The patient's initial presentation included hypotension, which was initially diagnosed as sepsis-induced respiratory syndrome (SIRS). However, the patient was source-negative for infection. The hypotension has resolved, and the patient is now normotensive. The patient experienced anemia, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), but this has resolved. He also had episodes of hematuria and bleeding from an internal jugular (IJ) site, which have also resolved. Heparin therapy was restarted overnight, and the patient will start taking warfarin today with an INR goal of 2.5-3.5.

The patient has lower extremity skin changes and an ear/facial wound that requires wound care, lidocaine dressings, compression stockings, and elevation of"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M with h/o COPD, CHF s/p AVR, admitted with progressive dyspnea,
   tx with steroids/diuresis, transferred back to MICU on [**7-10**] for
   increased dyspnea, tachypnea, requiring intubation.
   1.       Respiratory failure: pt with Pickwickian physiology, as well
   as chronic severe COPD/CHF.  Brought back to MICU ([**7-10**]) for likely
   flash pulm edema after prior extubation attempt.  Was extubated without
   difficulty [**2145-7-14**], with a RSBI 45, and diuresed well.  Currently
   oxygenating well on 4L NC. Complete course of Vanco/Zosyn for HAP x 7
   days.  Continue steroid taper (20 mg today).  Cont nebs.
   2.       Hypotension: primary dx was SIRS.  Pt has been source negative
   (DFA neg, Legionella neg, blood NGTD [**7-10**], urine neg [**7-10**], sputum neg
   [**7-12**]).  Off levophed with good MAPs.  Good UOP.  Slightly lower BP
   yesterday AM likely [**2-15**] aggressive diuresis.  Normotensive today.
   3.       Anemia: Hct stable/trending down.  Previous HCT drop with high
   PTT, in setting of ?GIB, now resolved.  EGD without bleeding source.
   Had episode of hematuria and bleeding from ear/IJ site yesterday, which
   is now resolved.  Was restarted on heparin gtt.  Will follow.
   Considerations include endobronchial lesion (hemoptysis) vs. more
   systemic issue given his hematuria and bleeding from multiple sites.
   4.       Mechanical aortic valve: heparin gtt started overnight, as PTT
   subtherapeutic and bleeding resolved.  Will start 5 mg coumadin today.
   INR goal 2.5-3.5.
   5.       Lower extremity skin changes and ear/facial wound - no
   erythema to LE, but +warmth.  More consistent with chronic venous
   changes presently, though does have some areas of skin breakdown which
   are at risk for infection.
                  - wound care [**Name8 (MD) 77**] RN.
                  - lidex dressings with compression stockings.
                  - keep LE elevated.
                  -Ear/face wound care [**Name8 (MD) 77**] RN recs.
   6.       Psych
 h/o schizophrenia and psychotic disorder, with
   frequent episodes of leaving hospital AMA.  Per Psych when
                  extubated and alert restart Trasadone @ 100mg PO qhs and
   increase by 100mg each day until at admission dose
                  (600 mg po qhs).
           7.    DM type 2
 currently on insulin 70/30 50U in AM and 50U
   in PM with SSI backup.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF), who was admitted with progressive dyspnea. He was treated with steroids and diuretics, and later transferred to the MICU due to increased dyspnea and tachypnea requiring intubation. The patient underwent extubation without difficulty and was successfully weaned off oxygen. His blood pressure remains stable, and he is now on a low dose of heparin due to a mechanical aortic valve. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, but there is a slight increase in the lactate level. He has a history of schizophrenia and psychotic disorder, for which he is being restarted on Trasadone. The patient also has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is on IVF nutrition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and CHF puts him at risk for respiratory failure. Since he required intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure after extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's primary diagnosis was sepsis-induced hypotension. Although his blood pressure has been stable recently, there is still a risk of hypotension due to his underlying conditions and potential complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is stable but trending down"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o M with h/o COPD, CHF s/p AVR, admitted with progressive dyspnea,
   tx with steroids/diuresis, transferred back to MICU on [**7-10**] for
   increased dyspnea, tachypnea, requiring intubation.
   1.       Respiratory failure: pt with Pickwickian physiology, as well
   as chronic severe COPD/CHF.  Brought back to MICU ([**7-10**]) for likely
   flash pulm edema after prior extubation attempt.  Was extubated without
   difficulty [**2145-7-14**], with a RSBI 45, and diuresed well.  Currently
   oxygenating well on 4L NC. Complete course of Vanco/Zosyn for HAP x 7
   days (day 6 today, stop date tomorrow).  Will place PICC line.
   Continue steroid taper (20 mg today).  Cont nebs.  Will start on 80 mg
   IV lasix (with goal to get to 160 mg home dose qAM).  Goal I/O -1.5L
   today.
   2.       Hypotension: primary dx was SIRS.  Pt has been source negative
   (DFA neg, Legionella neg, blood NGTD [**7-10**], urine neg [**7-10**], sputum neg
   [**7-12**]).  Off levophed with good MAPs.  Good UOP.  Slightly lower BP
   yesterday AM likely [**2-15**] aggressive diuresis.  Normotensive today.
   3.       Anemia: Hct stable/trending down.  Previous HCT drop with high
   PTT, in setting of ?GIB, now resolved.  EGD without bleeding source.
   Had episode of hematuria and bleeding from ear/IJ site yesterday, which
   is now resolved.  Was restarted on heparin gtt.  Will follow.
   Considerations include endobronchial lesion (hemoptysis) vs. more
   systemic issue given his hematuria and bleeding from multiple sites.
   4.       Mechanical aortic valve: heparin gtt started overnight, as PTT
   subtherapeutic and bleeding resolved.  Will start 5 mg coumadin today.
   INR goal 2.5-3.5.  Of note, heparin will be off prior to PICC
   placement.
   5.       Lower extremity skin changes and ear/facial wound - no
   erythema to LE, but +warmth.  More consistent with chronic venous
   changes presently, though does have some areas of skin breakdown which
   are at risk for infection.
                  - wound care [**Name8 (MD) 77**] RN.
                  - lidex dressings with compression stockings.
                  - keep LE elevated.
                  -Ear/face wound care [**Name8 (MD) 77**] RN recs.
   6.       Psych
 h/o schizophrenia and psychotic disorder, with
   frequent episodes of leaving hospital AMA.  Per Psych when
                  extubated and alert restart Trasadone @ 100mg PO qhs and
   increase by 100mg each day until at admission dose
                  (600 mg po qhs).
           7.    DM type 2

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and mechanical aortic valve. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and treated with steroids and diuretics. The patient required intubation and was transferred back to the MICU due to increased dyspnea and tachypnea. He was extubated without difficulty on 7/14. The patient will complete a 7-day course of Vancomycin/Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) today and will discontinue vanc and zosyn afterward. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter will be placed on Monday, pending further evaluation. The patient's current Hct (27.4) is slightly lower than previous values, indicating anemia. Heparin gtt and Coumadin were stopped yesterday due to excessive bleeding and blood stool, but will be restarted today. The goal INR is 2.5, and the goal PTT is 60-80. The patient has chronic venous stasis changes in both lower extremities, which may increase the risk of infection. Wound care recommendations will be followed, and the patient will be encouraged to refrain from re-injuring the affected areas. The patient has a history of schizophrenia and psychotic disorder, with frequent episodes of leaving the hospital against medical advice. Psychiatric recommendations will be followed to"

   increased dyspnea, tachypnea, requiring intubation.
   1.       Respiratory failure: pt with Pickwickian physiology, as well
   as chronic severe COPD/CHF.  Brought back to MICU ([**7-10**]) for likely
   flash pulm edema after prior extubation attempt.  Was extubated without
   difficulty [**2145-7-14**], with a RSBI 45, and diuresed well.  Currently
   oxygenating well on 4L NC. Complete course of Vanco/Zosyn for HAP x 7
   days (day 6 today, stop date tomorrow).  Will place PICC line.
   Continue steroid taper (20 mg today).  Cont nebs.  Will start on 80 mg
   IV lasix (with goal to get to 160 mg home dose qAM).  Goal I/O -1.5L

   3.       Anemia: Hct stable/trending down.  Previous HCT drop with high
   PTT, in setting of ?GIB, now resolved.  EGD without bleeding source.
   Had episode of hematuria and bleeding from ear/IJ site yesterday, which
   is now resolved.  Was restarted on heparin gtt.  Will follow.
   Considerations include endobronchial lesion (hemoptysis) vs. more
   systemic issue given his hematuria and bleeding from multiple sites.
   4.       Mechanical aortic valve: heparin gtt started overnight, as PTT
   subtherapeutic and bleeding resolved.  Will start 5 mg coumadin today.
   INR goal 2.5-3.5.  Of note, heparin will be off prior to PICC
   placement.

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and type II diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and treated with steroids and diuretics. He required intubation due to respiratory failure and was transferred back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for increased dyspnea and tachypnea.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, leukopenia, impaired skin integrity, obesity, and a mechanical aortic valve. He is currently on several medications, including steroids, diuretics, antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn), and insulin for his diabetes.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate 83 bpm, blood pressure 164/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 94% on 4 liters of nasal cannula. His current weight is 141.7 kg, and his height is 65 inches.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver function tests. However, his creatinine level is elevated at 0.8 mg/dL. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), morbid obesity, and type II diabetes mellitus. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient experienced a large bloody bowel movement and rectal bleeding, leading to significant blood loss. His vital signs are stable, but he requires respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device. Laboratory results indicate anemia, leukopenia, impaired skin integrity, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is receiving various ICU care interventions, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing blood loss and anemia.
2. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines.
3. Respiratory failure exacerbation, given the patient's pre-existing COPD and current need for respiratory support.
4. Pressure injuries or bedsores due to prolonged immobilization and impaired skin integrity.
5. Further gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, considering the recent bloody bowel movement.
6. Cardiac complications, including arrhythmias or heart failure, as indicated by elevated blood pressure and the patient's medical history.
7. Poor glycemic control, given the patient's type II diabetes mellitus and the stress of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and treated with steroids and diuretics. The patient required intubation due to increased dyspnea and tachypnea and was transferred back to the MICU for respiratory failure. He was extubated without difficulty on [**2145-7-14**]. The patient is currently receiving a 7-day course of Vancomycin/Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and will continue steroid tapering. The goal is to achieve negative fluid balance today. The patient's current Hct (27.4) is slightly lower than previous values, but overall Hct remains stable. There are concerns regarding potential complications such as electrolyte and fluid disorders, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, leukopenia, impaired skin integrity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, obesity, diabetes mellitus type II, hypotension, mechanical aortic valve, lower extremity skin changes, ear/facial wound, schizophrenia, and psychotic disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and fluid disorders: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes including low potassium (3.8 mEq/L), low sodium (112/52 mmHg), and high bicarbonate (CO2 46-47 mmHg). Fluid balance is also negative (-2,973 mL) suggesting dehydration or fluid loss.
2. Acute anemia: The patient's Hct (27.4) is slightly lower than previous values indicating a possible decrease in red blood cell count.
3. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly below normal range (4.6 K/uL), which could indicate an increased risk of infection.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has lower extremity skin changes and ear/facial wounds, which may be consistent with chronic venous stasis and risk for infection.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation: The patient's respiratory symptoms and history of COPD suggest a potential worsening of his respiratory condition.
6. Obesity: The patient's weight is 141.2 kg, indicating obesity.
7. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has a history of diabetes and is currently on an insulin regimen.
8. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, but there is a concern for potential hypotension due to the use of anticoagulants and the presence of hypotension overnight.
9. Mechanical aortic valve: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve, requiring careful monitoring of coagulation parameters and anticoagulant therapy.
10. Schizophrenia and psychotic disorder: The patient has a history of schizophrenia and psychotic disorder, which may affect his mental status and ability to follow medical advice.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information and tests may be required to assess the patient's condition accurately."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and mechanical aortic valve. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and treated with steroids and diuretics. The patient required intubation and was transferred back to the MICU due to increased dyspnea and tachypnea.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure - The patient has chronic severe COPD/CHF and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The plan is to continue weaning off the ventilator and eventually extubate the patient once stable.

2. Hypotension - The patient's primary diagnosis was sepsis-induced respiratory syndrome (SIRS). Initial urine culture was negative, but blood culture is pending. Sputum culture showed rare yeast. The patient's blood pressure has been stable overnight, indicating improvement.

3. Anemia - The patient's current hematocrit (Hct) level is slightly lower than previous measurements. However, overall Hct levels are stable. Monitoring of Hct levels will continue.

4. Mechanical Aortic Valve - The patient's goal International Normalized Ratio (INR) is 2.5. However, previous measurements showed an INR of 3.5. Heparin gtt and Coumadin were stopped due to excessive bleeding and blood stool, but will be restarted today with a 3600 U bol"

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of COPD, CHF, and mechanical aortic valve, admitted with progressive dyspnea. He was treated with steroids and diuretics and later transferred back to the MICU for increased dyspnea and tachypnea requiring intubation. The patient completed a 7-day course of Vancomycin/Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) today. He also completed a steroid taper today. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 112/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is somnolent but arousable, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals wheezing present bilaterally, chronic venous stasis changes in both legs, and pitting edema in the lower extremities. Laboratory results show normal levels of potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate, as well as elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactic acid. The patient's INR is within the therapeutic range. The patient's fluid balance is negative 2.9 liters since 12 AM.

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and mechanical aortic valve. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and treated with steroids and diuretics. The patient required intubation and was transferred back to the MICU due to increased dyspnea and tachypnea. He has completed a 7-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 112/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance is negative 2.9 liters since midnight. Laboratory results show anemia with a hematocrit of 27.4%, elevated white blood cell count, and normal liver and kidney function. The patient's coagulation profile is pending. The patient's medical history includes schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic venous stasis with potential risk for infection. The patient is currently on heparin sodium, furosemide, and other medications as per the ICU care plan.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and mechanical aortic valve. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and treated with steroids and diuretics. The patient required intubation due to increased dyspnea and tachypnea. He underwent a 7-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia. A PICC line was placed but may no longer be necessary. The patient completed a steroid taper today.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient has severe chronic COPD/CHF and was brought back to the MICU for flash pulmonary edema. He was extubated without difficulty on [**2145-7-14**].
2. Hypotension - The patient is normotensive overnight and has no acute issues.
3. Anemia - The patient's current hematocrit (Hct) is 27.0, showing a slight decrease from his previous Hct of 29. Monitoring of Hct will continue.
4. Mechanical Aortic Valve - The patient's goal INR is 2.5, but his current INR is 3.5. He will be restarted on warfarin when his partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is closer to the goal range of 60-80 seconds. PENDING coagulation results.
5. Lower Extremity Skin Changes and Ear/Facial Wound - The patient has chronic venous stasis with potential for infection. Wound care, lidocaine, and lower extremity elevation will be continued. The patient should avoid reinjuring the affected areas.
6. History of Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorder - The patient has had frequent episodes of leaving the hospital against medical advice (AMA). If this happens again, the patient's capacity will need to be addressed. Trazodone has been held at a dose of 300 mg per night due to the patient appearing somnolent.
7. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 - The patient's current insulin regimen will be continued.
8. Lines/Tubes: The patient has an arterial line, multi-lumen central venous catheter, and a 20-gauge peripheral IV line.
9. Prophylaxis: Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will be continued.
10. Code status: The patient is designated as full code.
11. Disposition: The patient will be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient may experience recurrent respiratory failure due to his severe chronic COPD/CHF.
2. Hypotension - The patient may develop hypotension if there are any acute issues or if his cardiac function worsens.
3. Anemia - The patient's anemia may worsen if his Hct continues to decrease.
4. Mechanical Aortic Valve - The patient may have an increased risk of bleeding due to his elevated INR.
5. Lower Extremity Skin Changes and Ear/Facial Wound - The patient may develop further skin breakdown and infection if proper wound care is not maintained.
