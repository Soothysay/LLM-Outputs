   Assessment and Plan
   31 yo M with history of narcotic/heroin abuse found unresponsive,
   respiratory failure, intubated at OSH.
   # Respiratory failure:  Given clinical setting, patient likely
   aspirated.  Has evidence of patchy infiltrates on CXR and ?abscess on R
   side, leukocytosis with bandemia of 17%, rectal temperature of 100, and
   lactate of 2.9.  ABG with A-a gradient with pO2 of 76 despite 100%
   FiO2.  Qualifies for ARDS likely [**3-11**] pneumonitis.  CXR significantly
   improved.
   - cont. CTX/clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia coverage
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures - NGTD
   - trend WBC, bandemia, lactate
   - plan to extubate today
   - consider changing regimen to azitho v levaquin if extubates
   successfully.
   # Aspiration pneumonia v. pneumonitis:  As above.  No signs of septic
   shock (briefly hypotensive after starting propofol, improved with
   weaning of dilt) at this time though leukocyte count has fallen
   dramatically and bandemia has emerged.
   - empiric ceftriaxone/clindamycin
   - f/u sputum cx, bcxs, ucx
   - hold on CVL for now but if clinically worsens, will need central
   access
   - consider changing regimen to azitho v levaquin if extubates
   successfully.
   # Acute mental status changes:  Likely secondary to opiate abuse, did
   not improve with narcan.  [**Month (only) 8**] have lost tolerance while clean for the
   past 8 months.  Although has infectious/inflammatory process, unlikely
   to be meninigitis as was fine couple hours prior to presentation.
   - supportive care

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of narcotic/heroin abuse who was found unresponsive and intubated at the emergency department. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has evidence of patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray and leukocytosis with bandemia. His ABG results show an A-a gradient with a pO2 of 76 despite receiving 100% FiO2, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's mental status has been altered, possibly secondary to opiate abuse, and he has not improved with Narcan. He is currently sedated and unable to provide a medical history.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 107/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on mechanical ventilation. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation and has an arterial line in place. He is also receiving IV antibiotics (ceftriaxone and clindamycin) for aspiration pneumonia coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:

 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   31 yo M with history of narcotic/heroin abuse found unresponsive,
   respiratory failure, intubated at OSH.
   # Respiratory failure:  Given clinical setting, patient likely
   aspirated.  Has evidence of patchy infiltrates on CXR and ?abscess on R
   side, leukocytosis with bandemia of 17%, rectal temperature of 100, and
   lactate of 2.9.  ABG with A-a gradient with pO2 of 76 despite 100%
   FiO2.  Qualifies for ARDS.
   - cont. CTX/clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia coverage
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures
   - trend WBC, bandemia, lactate
   - cont. ARDsnet protocol with low tidal volumes and plateau pressure
   <30
   - wean FiO2 as tolerated
   # Aspiration pneumonia v. pneumonitis:  As above.  No signs of septic
   shock (briefly hypotensive after starting propofol, improved with
   weaning of dilt) at this time though leukocyte count has fallen
   dramatically and bandemia has emerged.
   - empiric ceftriaxone/clindamycin
   - f/u sputum cx, bcxs, ucx
   - hold on CVL for now but if clinically worsens, will need central
   access
   - serial CXRs to assess R-sided lesion
   - consider CT chest if R-sided lesion persists
   # Acute mental status changes:  Likely secondary to opiate abuse, did
   not improve with narcan.  [**Month (only) 8**] have lost tolerance while clean for the
   past 8 months.  Although has infectious/inflammatory process, unlikely
   to be meninigitis as was fine couple hours prior to presentation.
   - supportive care
   - propofol gtt to monitor mental status
   # HCT drop, plt drop:
   - recheck CBC
   - check coags
   - Add on hemolysis labs, peripheral smear for RBC morphology
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Likely secondary to hypoxia.  Converted to SR
   on dilt.  Currently off dilt gtt.
   - monitor on tele
   # Troponin leak:  Likely from a fib.  Resolved.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of narcotic/heroin abuse who was found unresponsive and subsequently intubated due to respiratory failure. He has evidence of aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray, leukocytosis with bandemia, rectal temperature of 100 degrees, and lactate of 2.9. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which resolved after being converted to sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Measures to prevent VAP include elevating the head of bed, performing daily sedation assessments, implementing oral hygiene, and regularly assessing respiratory secretions.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT formation. Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin is being administered to reduce this risk.

3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections. Careful monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of laboratory parameters are necessary to detect any potential infections early on.

4. Organ dysfunction: The patient's respiratory failure and sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of organ functions, such as kidney function, liver enzymes, and cardiac enzymes,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of narcotic/heroin abuse who was found unresponsive and intubated at the hospital. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia, and is suspected to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition improved significantly, and he was successfully extubated. He is now receiving treatment for aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics and is being monitored for any complications. The patient also has a history of opiate abuse and is being referred for a social worker consultation. His hematocrit and platelet count have dropped, but they are currently stable. He had transient episodes of atrial fibrillation and troponin leak, both of which have resolved. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and patchy infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggest aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to further lung infections and sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's clinical setting, leukocytosis with bandemia, high lactate levels, and ABG findings indicate the possibility of ARDS. If not treated promptly and effectively, ARDS can lead to severe respiratory failure and death.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing"

   31 yo M with history of narcotic/heroin abuse found unresponsive,
   respiratory failure, intubated at OSH.
   # Respiratory failure:  Given clinical setting, patient likely
   aspirated.  Has evidence of patchy infiltrates on CXR and ?abscess on R
   side, leukocytosis with bandemia of 17%, rectal temperature of 100, and
   lactate of 2.9.  ABG with A-a gradient with pO2 of 76 despite 100%
   FiO2.  Qualifies for ARDS likely [**3-11**] pneumonitis.  CXR significantly
   improved. Pt successfully extubated.
   - cont. CTX/clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia coverage
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures - NGTD

   # Opiate Abuse - Pt states that he had been clean for 8 months and then
   had one night of indiscretion.
   - SW consult
   # Aspiration pneumonia v. pneumonitis:  As above.  No signs of septic
   shock (briefly hypotensive after starting propofol, improved with
   weaning of dilt) at this time though leukocyte count has fallen
   dramatically and bandemia has emerged.
   - empiric ceftriaxone/clindamycin
   - f/u sputum cx, bcxs, ucx
   - consider changing regimen to azitho v levaquin if extubates
   successfully.
   # HCT drop, plt drop:
   - recheck CBC - stable
   - check coags
   - no schistos on smear
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Likely secondary to hypoxia.  Resolved.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Troponin leak:  Likely from a fib.  Resolved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of narcotic/heroin abuse who was found unresponsive and intubated at the hospital. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration, as evidenced by patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray and leukocytosis with bandemia. He also has evidence of aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis, which may have led to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's opiate abuse history is also mentioned, and social work consultation has been requested.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure ranging from 113/60 to 98/54 mmHg, heart rate between 89 and 121 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 17 and 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 89%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, warm skin, and no edema or cyanosis.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal troponin T levels. The patient's platelet count is stable, and other lab values are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include continued antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia, follow-up cultures, and consideration of changing the antibiotic regimen if the patient successfully extubates. Social work consultation is planned due to the patient's opiate abuse history. The patient's H"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of narcotic/heroin abuse who was found unresponsive and intubated at the emergency department. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, and pneumonitis. The patient's condition has improved, and he was successfully extubated. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition where the lungs are unable to provide enough oxygen to the body. This could be due to aspiration of gastric contents leading to chemical pneumonitis and possible development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray, leukocytosis with bandemia, and a high lactate level, indicating possible aspiration pneumonia. This condition can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and potentially ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Opiate Abuse: The patient reported a recent episode of opiate abuse. Continued use of opiates can lead to respiratory depression, decreased level of consciousness, and increased risk of aspiration and respiratory failure.

4. Pneumonitis: The patient may develop pneumonitis, which is inflammation of the lung tissue. This can be caused by infection, such as aspiration pneumonia, or other factors like drug reactions or blood transfusion reactions.

5. Stress Ulcer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of narcotic/heroin abuse who was found unresponsive and intubated at the hospital. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia or opiate-induced pulmonary edema. The patient has been extubated and is now on incentive spirometry. His opiate abuse is being addressed with a social work consult. He also has sinus tachycardia, which is being monitored. The patient's hematocrit and platelet levels have stabilized, and there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). His atrial fibrillation and troponin leak have resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure could potentially lead to complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient may have aspirated, leading to an infection in the lungs. This could progress to pneumonia or lung abscess.
3. Opiate-induced pulmonary edema: The patient's rapid recovery suggests that opiate-induced pulmonary edema may be a more likely cause than aspiration pneumonia.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent sinus tachycardia could potentially lead to complications related to increased heart rate and cardiac output.
5. Blood clotting disorders: Although the patient's hematocrit and platelet levels have stabilized, there is still a risk of developing"

   Microbiology: Sputum [**11-19**] - NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   31 yo M with history of narcotic/heroin abuse found unresponsive,
   respiratory failure, intubated at OSH.
   # Respiratory failure:  Given clinical setting, patient likely
   aspirated.  Has evidence of patchy infiltrates on CXR and ?abscess on R
   side, leukocytosis with bandemia of 17%, rectal temperature of 100, and
   lactate of 2.9.  ABG with A-a gradient with pO2 of 76 despite 100%
   FiO2.  Qualifies for ARDS likely [**3-11**] pneumonitis.  CXR significantly
   improved. Pt successfully extubated.
   - cont. CTX/clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia coverage
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine cultures - NGTD
   - consider changing regimen to azitho v levaquin today
   # Opiate Abuse - Pt states that he had been clean for 8 months and then
   had one night of indiscretion.
   - SW consult
   # Aspiration pneumonia v. pneumonitis:  As above.  No signs of septic
   shock (briefly hypotensive after starting propofol, improved with
   weaning of dilt) at this time though leukocyte count has fallen
   dramatically and bandemia has emerged.
   - empiric ceftriaxone/clindamycin
   - f/u sputum cx, bcxs, ucx
   - consider changing regimen to azitho v levaquin if extubates
   successfully.
   # HCT drop, plt drop:
   - recheck CBC - stable
   - check coags
   - no schistos on smear
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Likely secondary to hypoxia.  Resolved.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Troponin leak:  Likely from a fib.  Resolved.

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of narcotic/heroin abuse who was found unresponsive and intubated at OSH. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration, and has evidence of patchy infiltrates on CXR and possibly an abscess on the right side. He also has leukocytosis with bandemia, rectal temperature of 100, and lactate of 2.9. The ABG shows an A-a gradient with a pO2 of 76 despite 100% FiO2, indicating severe hypoxemia. He qualifies for ARDS likely secondary to pneumonitis. The patient has been successfully extubated.

Other conditions and potential complications include:

1. Opiate abuse: The patient admits to having had one night of indiscretion after being clean for 8 months. A social worker (SW) consult is planned.

2. Aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis: The patient's clinical setting suggests he may have aspirated, leading to patchy infiltrates on CXR and possibly an abscess on the right side. He has leukocytosis with bandemia, fever, and elevated lactate levels. There are no signs of septic shock at this time, but the leukocyte count has fallen dramatically and bandemia has emerged.

3. HCT drop, plt drop: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) and platelet count have decreased. A repeat"
