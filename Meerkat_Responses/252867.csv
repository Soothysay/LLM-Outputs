","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old female with poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), hypertension, and acute anemia admitted to the GYN department for menorrhagia. She was transferred to the MICU due to labile blood sugars. She experienced hypoglycemia overnight and received glucagon and D50, which improved her responsiveness. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has increased from 18 to 27 after receiving four units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate (HR) of 74 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 110/53 to 188/113 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. She is not on respiratory support. Her blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.18. The patient's physical examination reveals no specific abnormalities. Laboratory results indicate anemia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.6 g/dL, and hematocrit (Hct) of 28.3%. Other lab values show elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 11"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old female with poorly-controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and hypertension. She was admitted to the gynecology service with menorrhagia and acute anemia, and later transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for labile blood sugars.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient is experiencing acute anemia secondary to blood loss. This could be due to her menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding).
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient has an anion gap acidosis, there are no ketones in her urine, which suggests that she may not have DKA. However, her high blood glucose levels need to be monitored closely.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently high, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Insulin therapy may be necessary to manage her blood sugar levels.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap acidosis, likely due to uremia from her ESRD. Monitoring her vital signs, electrolyte levels, and acid-base balance is important.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which needs to be managed with antihypertensive medications.
6. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is on PD and requires careful monitoring"

   # Labile blood sugars:  Patient with lows after receiving home insulin
   while NPO and highs while given an amp of D50.  Currently with blood
   glucose near 400.  Nothing to suggest acut process that could
   precipitate uncontrolled sugars.  While does have an anion gap
   acidosis, no ketones in urine to suggest DKA.
   - restart home regimen Regular U-500 [**2078-9-28**] at breakfast, lunch,
   bedtime + Humalog 12 units at dinner + Humalog ISS at dinner per latest
   [**Last Name (un) 303**] note.

attributed to NPO for possible OR.
   110units humalin U at lunch
   145units humalin U at bedtime:
   - check 2hr finger sticks
   - if continues to have poorly controlled glucose, will initiate insulin
   gtt at 2 units.  Will avoid D10 if possible due to RF
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 303**] recs in the morning

   # Menoraghia:  Hct had not increase to transfusion. Currently 21, with
   baseline of 24.  No evidence of hemodynamic instability.  Rate of
   vaginal bleeding has improved and ultrasound negative.  One dose of
   estrogen given by GYN, and will consider additional doses vs. D+C in
   the morning.
   - f/u gyn recs. Completed esotrogen.
   - active bleeding or hct > 25

   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Has an anion gap of 19, but pt with chronic
   anion gap and acidosis with HCO3 chronically of 16.  No ketones on UA.
   Suspect most likely from uremia from ESRD.
   - check VBG lactate

   Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 12571**] is a 34 year-old woman with bipolar disorder and lupus who
   was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for delirum resistant to
   neuroleptics and is admitted to the MICU for delirium.
   .
   # Delirium:  Acutely delirius and psychotic on arrival to floor and
   psych consulted.  Code purple called and given ~45 mg haldol po/iv and
   2 mg ativan with mild improvement in agitation. Likely multifactorial
   etiology including medication effects (given benzos, antipsychotics at
   [**Hospital1 1595**]), possible withdrawal, and would also consider
   toxic-metabolic/infectious etiologies.  Would also consider lupus
   vasculitis with neural involvement. TCA intoxication likely from
   flexeril and QRS 80 ms.
   - haldol q4h prn with q15m for acute agitation
   - will avoid benzos
   - toxic-metabolic evaluation with TSH, b12, rpr, urine culture
   - check ESR and CRP to eval for lupus flare
   - four point restraints and soft mitts
   - 1:1 sitter
   - will restart clonidine; indication is unclear, no history of htn; may
   be for withdrawal
   - head CT when patient can tolerate
   - check EKG/QTc
   - psych reccs
   .
   # Acute kidney injury: likely in setting of decreased po intake.  Would
   also consider lupus nephritis.
   - IVFs
   - check UA, urine lytes
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Lupus:  Will need to acquire more history from patient's PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 54**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder, lupus, and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). She was admitted to the ICU for acute delirium, which is resistant to neuroleptics. The patient also has chronic renal failure secondary to lupus nephropathy. She presented with heavy vaginal bleeding and was found to have a low hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but showed no improvement in her hemoglobin level. A vaginal ultrasound revealed normal vaginal anatomy. She remained hemodynamically stable with systolic blood pressures between 140-170 mmHg. The patient was given one dose of intravenous lasix 40mg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient's heavy vaginal bleeding has resulted in a low hemoglobin level, indicating acute anemia. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness.
2. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type 1: The patient has a history of T1DM, which requires lifelong insulin therapy. Poor glycemic control can lead to complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
3. Renal failure, chronic (chronic renal failure, CRF, chronic kidney disease): The patient's chronic renal failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old female with poorly-controlled DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1), ESRD (end-stage renal disease) on PD (peritoneal dialysis), hypertension, admitted to GYN (gynecology) with menorrhagia and acute anemia, transferred to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) for labile blood sugars. She is currently on insulin therapy and has been making modifications to her insulin regimen based on recommendations from her healthcare provider. The patient also has other medical conditions including metabolic acidosis, restless legs/neuropathy, OSA (obstructive sleep apnea), and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes management requires careful monitoring of blood glucose levels. Insulin therapy, especially in a hospital setting, can increase the risk of hypoglycemia if not properly adjusted.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's labile blood sugars indicate fluctuations in blood glucose levels, which can lead to hyperglycemia. Poorly-controlled diabetes increases the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to uremia from ESRD. Close monitoring of acid-base balance is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Fluid Overload: As the patient has ESRD and is on PD"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress. They have a history of type I diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and acute anemia secondary to blood loss. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 131/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has increased from 73.9 kg at admission to 76.4 kg currently.

The patient received 20 units of Humalog in the afternoon for hyperglycemia with a blood glucose level of 400s. They also received hydralazine infusion as ordered on 02/16/16 at 04:00 PM.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,385 mL and total output of 2,300 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 915 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 245 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 18.7% to 24.2%, and low platelet count (Plt) of 8.6 K/uL. Kidney function tests indicate elevated creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 9.4 mg/dL to 11.2 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels show imbalances in potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-).

Microbiology tests show no growth in gram stain, fluid culture, and anaerobic culture. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating throughout the day, with readings of 157 mg/dL, 105 mg/dL, 215 mg/dL, and 128 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are significantly elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. This increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest compromised kidney function. This can be further complicated by the presence of chronic renal failure.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate acute anemia. Without proper management, this can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
4. Infection: Despite negative microbiology results, the patient is still at risk of developing infections due to their compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.
6. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can increase the risk of stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Please note that these are potential complications based on the provided information, and a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to confirm and manage these risks."

   nephropathy followed at the [**Last Name (un) 303**] who as admitted on the day of
   presentation to the GYN service after presenting with vaginal
   bleeding.  The patient describes having heavy vaginal bleeding since
   [**2-8**], going through 4 pads per hour.  While undergoing PD dialysis
   today, she was noted to have a HCT of 17.  She received 1 unit of PRBC,
   with no improvement ( 21 --> 21).  A vaginal ultrasound was obtained,
   showed normal vaginal anatomy.  She remained hemodynamically stable,
   with SBPs between 140-170.  The patinet was additonally given one dose
   of IV lasix 40mg.

   nephropathy followed at the [**Last Name (un) 303**] who as admitted on the day of
   presentation to the GYN service after presenting with vaginal
   bleeding.  The patient describes having heavy vaginal bleeding since
   [**2-8**], going through 4 pads per hour.  While undergoing PD dialysis
   today, she was noted to have a HCT of 17.  She received 1 unit of PRBC,
   with no improvement ( 21 --> 21).  A vaginal ultrasound was obtained,
   showed normal vaginal anatomy.  She remained hemodynamically stable,
   with SBPs between 140-170.  The patinet was additonally given one dose
   of IV lasix 40mg.

   erradic blood sugars.  She became hypoglycemic, with blood sugar of 62,
   but rose to 376 foolowing 1 amp of D50.  With concern that she may need
   an insulin gtt she was transfered to the MICU for further manemgent.
   Of note, the patient was admitted to the MICU in [**1-15**] for DKA.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old female with poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, hypertension, and a history of hypoglycemic episodes. She was initially admitted to the gynecology department for menorrhagia and acute anemia, and later transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for labile blood sugars. Her metabolic acidosis has resolved. 

The patient has experienced hypoglycemic episodes, with the lowest blood sugar level recorded at 14 this morning. This was attributed to her being NPO (nothing by mouth) status, but she had a full meal yesterday dinner. It was decided to down-titrate the bedtime human insulin in consultation with an endocrinologist.

Regarding menorrhagia, the patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) during her MICU stay, and none in the past 24 hours. Her hematocrit (Hct) increased overnight to 28, and vaginal bleeding has significantly improved according to the patient. She was given estrogen IV three doses per gynecology recommendation.

Other medical issues include hypertension, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, restless legs/neuropathy, and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient's home medications will continue to be titrated, and she will continue her regimen of gabapentin and pramipexole for restless legs/neurop"
