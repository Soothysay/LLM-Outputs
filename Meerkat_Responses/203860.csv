   Please see MICU admission note dated [**2149-9-24**] for further details.
   Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 7685**] is a 63 y.o. M with ESLD [**2-10**] ETOH cirrhosis c/b
   hepatic encephalopathy, admitted to MICU [**Location (un) **] on [**2149-9-24**] for altered
   mental status.  He had two recent admissions prior to this one.
   [**Date range (1) 8028**]: R axillary hematoma requiring massive blood product
   resuscitation.  [**Date range (1) 8675**]: R groin bleed which achieved hemostasis with
   DDAVP and aminocaproic acid.  On the evening of [**9-22**], pt's sister noted
   that he had normal mental status.  The following morning, he appeared
   confused and was not eating and had not used the bathroom.  Symptoms
   progressed and by the evening, he was awake but not verbal.  Sister
   brought him to [**Name (NI) **].
   .
   In the ED, initial VS: T 97  HR 73  BP 127/68  RR 24  100% 2 L NC.
   Paracentesis negative for SBP. RUQ US which showed GB sludge and patent
   portal vein. Received 1 L NS and flagyl 500 mg IV x 1. Transferred to
   ICU.
   .
   From [**Date range (1) 8676**], pt was in MICU [**Location (un) **].  His altered mental status was
   treated with lactulose and etiology likely medication noncompliance.
   ARF of 1.9 from baseline 0.8.  Fluid boluses given with resolution of
   ARF.  Also had BRBPR in ED, and [**Hospital1 **] Hcts monitored. Ceftriaxone IV was
   continued for ppx.  On [**9-26**], the patient was transferred to Liver
   Kidney Service ([**Hospital Ward Name 408**] 10).
   .
   From [**Date range (1) 8677**], the [**Hospital 1050**] hospital course was the following:
   * Altered mental status: treating with lactulose, rifaximin
   * ARF: first thought to be pre-renal [**2-10**] poor po intake, held
   diuretics, and resolved.  Re-initiated diuretics on [**9-28**], lasix held on
   [**10-1**].  Cr trended up on [**10-5**] and treated with albumin challenge x 2
   days and transfused with pRBC. Cr continued to trend up. Started
   midodrine and octreotide on [**10-15**]. Renal consulted, felt likely HRS and
   less likely abdominal compartment syndrome.
   * BRBPR: NG without gross blood. Hct trended.
   * Metabolic acidosis: Non AG noted which was felt to be due to diarrhea
   and r/o RTA Type 2 with urine lytes.
   * Diarrhea: Around [**2149-9-30**], pt noted to have 2.5 L watery profuse stool
   with c. diff negative. [**Month/Day/Year **] negative, CT abdomen/pelvis completed.
   * UTI: treated with ciprofloxacin x 3 days ([**10-2**])
   * Ileus/Pseudo-obstruction: On [**10-5**], CT showed stable ileus of
   transverse colon on CT and KUB. Pt still passing flatus. Flex sig on
   [**10-6**] with bowel decompression. Pt initially refused rectal tube, but
   then consented on [**10-8**]. Pt's HR and BP too low for neostigmmine.
   Surgery consulted. Started on reglan [**10-13**] without significant
   improvement.
   * Coagulopathy: Multifactorial from lupus anticoagulant and liver
   dysfunction. Large chest wall hematoma found on CT on [**10-15**].  Monitored
   with serial Hcts.
   .
   On [**10-18**], MICU consult was requested due to patient's altered mental
   status secondary to high dose narcotic. Narcan x 3 given with
   improvement in mental status.  ICU transfer deferred.
   .
   On [**10-19**], pt was transferred to MICU service due to traumatic foley
   placement with bleeding from site as well as bleeding from 3 L
   abdominal paracentesis site that was performed on [**10-18**].  He was given
   1 pRBC and 4 FFP.  Patient was called out to the floor on [**10-20**].
   .
   On [**10-26**], transferred back to the MICU for melenic stool and HCT drop
   from 23>17.  Pt without complaint.  Brown stool shortly after arrival
   but hematoma on posterior chest wall appears expanded

   Assessment and Plan
   63 y.o. M with ESLD [**2-10**] ETOH cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy with
   lengthy hospital course c/b colonic pseudo-obstruction, traumatic foley
   placement, and bleeding from paracentesis site, transferred to ICU for
   hemodynamic monitoring.
   .
   # Blood Clot  PR x 1: Stable. H/o hemorrhoids on previous colonsocopy
   and varices on EGD (4 grade 1). Also with lupus anticoagulant.   Had
   bowel movement after coming to the ICU which was guaiac negative.
   - trend Hct, type and screen, transfuse for Hct < 22
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Has underlying liver disease as well as lupus
   anticoagulant positive.  Pt also with bleeding from abdominal para site
   and s/p traumatic foley placement
   - s/p vitamin K po x 1
   - FFP for INR > 2
   - Transfuse for HCT<22
   - Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given, repeat PRN
   - s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - Can use amicar for uncontrolled bleeding if necessary; dose 5gram
   loading dose over 1 hour followed by 5mg PO (check dosing interval)
   - trend Hct, plt's, INR and fibrinogen q 4 hours
   - CT scan chest wall to evaluate for expansion of hematoma
   - if rebleeds into hematoma, it is unlikely that they would be able to
   intervene because a permanent bloackade was placed in the artery
   .
   # Chest Wall Hematoma: Has been stable by imaging with ? evidence of
   slow ooze by most recent CT.
   - repeat CT to evaluate for expansion of clot
   - follow clinically
   - correct coagulopathy
   .
   # Traumatic foley placement: Pt continues to ooze from urethra around
   catheter. Per urology, foley should be continued for at least one
   week.
   - serial hcts daily
   - bladder irrigation if clots in foley bag
   - penile u/s ordered to look for urethral tear
   .
   # Abdominal Wall Bleeding: Several small hematoma in abdomen, ascitic
   fluid w/o stigmata of bleeding, and otherwise notable for massive
   ascites.
   - correct coagulopathy as above
   - active T&S
   - transfuse for Hct<22 or active bleeding, HD instability
   .
   # Colonic Pseudo-obstruction: Has failed rectal tube, did not tolerate
   NG tube, sigmoidoscopy did not result in decompression for any
   sustained period, and high risk for neostigmine given bradycardia and
   risk of heart block.
   - weekly KUBs (tomorrow)
   .
   # ESLD: Not transplant candidate given active drinking.  Plans to have
   transplant eval at [**Hospital1 **].  [**Month (only) 11**] now have hepatorenal syndrome which will
   not be helped by acute blood loss
   - transplant eval at [**Hospital1 **] on discharge
   - measure bladder pressures to r/o compartment syndrome as ascites
   reaccumulates
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely 2/2 HRS
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Diarrhea - Chronic, likely combination of lactulose and
   nonobstructing ileus. Colonic ileus is stable by CT and KUB. non-gap
   metabolic acidosis continues, but still likely related to diarrhea.
   Patient ambulating to bedside commode without problems. [**Name (NI) **] negative
   for celiac disease.
   - monitor labs including lytes
   - holding lactulose for now
   - replete lytes prn
   .
   # Mental Status: Opiate sedation resolving, mild asterixis.
   - avoid narcotics and sedating medications
   .
   # FEN: no IVFs / replete lytes prn / TPN
   # PPX: ranitidine, INR elevated
   # ACCESS: 1 PIV  18 gauge, 1 Double lumen PICC

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to ETOH (alcohol) cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times. The patient has a history of acute blood loss, bleeding from various sites, and coagulopathy. 

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, fatigue, no fever, dry mouth, no epistaxis, no gastrointestinal symptoms, and edema in the lower extremities. The patient also has jaundice and warm skin.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 112/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has undergone several interventions including paracentesis, placement of a foley catheter, administration of lactulose, rifaximin, ciprofloxacin, midodrine, octreotide, and topical thrombin. The patient has also received blood products and fresh frozen plasma transfusions.

The patient's lab results show an elevated creatinine level, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been dropping, indicating ongoing blood loss.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a chest wall hematoma that is stable but with slow ooze, no evidence of bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract,"

   Assessment and Plan
   63M with ETOH cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy,
   esophageal varices, and coagulopathy with lengthy hospital course for
   colonic pseudoobstruction s/p endoscopic decompression, traumatic foley
   placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma
   status post embolization x2, transferred back to ICU for hemodynamic
   monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.
   .
   #Acute blood loss anemia
 multiple sources with reexpansion of chest
   wall hematoma, GU bleeding (less likely GI given brown BM with negative
   guaiac); presently hemostatic, Hct responded to supportive therapy with
   blood & factors but complicated by comorbid ESLD coagulopathy and
   likely DIC
   -monitor Hct q4h today then broaden interval if stable
   -active T&S, transfuse for Hct < 21%, <25% if active rebleeding
   -guaiac stools
   -appreciate surgery involvement
   .
   #Coagulopathy: ESLD, lupus anticoagulant positive; has required ddavp &
   amicar in the past; s/p topical thrombin for abdominal wall site
   - labs q4h until clearly stabilized
   - FFP for INR > 2, cryo for fibrinogen < 100
   - DDAVP given in past, repeat PRN
   - consider amicar for uncontrolled bleeding; dose 5gram loading dose
   over 1 hour followed by 5mg PO (check dosing interval)
   - f/u blood, urine Cx

   -f/u UCx
   .
   # Traumatic foley placement: Pt continues to ooze from urethra around
   catheter. Per urology, foley should be continued for at least one week
   -appreciate urology involvement
   -eval/treatment as above
   - bladder irrigation if clots in foley bag
   - urology following

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and liver cirrhosis, presenting with acute blood loss anemia due to multiple sources of bleeding, including reexpansion of a chest wall hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, and genitourinary bleeding. The patient has been receiving supportive therapy with blood transfusions and coagulation factors. However, the patient is complicated by comorbid end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's hemodynamic monitoring is being continued in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has ongoing bleeding from multiple sources, which has led to acute blood loss anemia. Close monitoring of hemoglobin (Hct) levels is required, and blood transfusions may be necessary to maintain an adequate Hct level.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has ESLD, which predisposes him to coagulopathy. Additionally, the patient has a positive lupus anticoagulant and has required DDAVP and amicar in the past. Frequent laboratory monitoring is needed, and appropriate coagulation support with FFP or cryoprecipitate may be required based on INR and fibrinogen levels.
3. Traumatic foley placement: The patient continues to experience oozing from the urethra around the catheter, indicating ongoing bleeding. Foley catheter management should be continued"

   loading dose over 1 hour followed by 5mg PO (check dosing interval)
   - trend Hct, plt's, INR and fibrinogen q 4 hours
   - CT scan chest wall showed no expansion of hematoma
   - if rebleeds into hematoma, it is unlikely that they would be able to
   intervene because a permanent bloackade was placed in the artery
   .
   # Chest Wall Hematoma: Has been stable by imaging with ? evidence of
   slow ooze by most recent CT.
   - repeat CT showed stable
   - follow clinically
   - correct coagulopathy
   .
   # Traumatic foley placement: Pt continues to ooze from urethra around
   catheter. Per urology, foley should be continued for at least one
   week.
   - serial hcts daily
   - bladder irrigation if clots in foley bag
   - penile u/s ordered to look for urethral tear
   - urology following
   .
   # Abdominal Wall Bleeding: Several small hematoma in abdomen, ascitic
   fluid w/o stigmata of bleeding, and otherwise notable for massive
   ascites.
   - correct coagulopathy as above
   - active T&S
   - transfuse for Hct<22 or active bleeding, HD instability
   .
   # Colonic Pseudo-obstruction: Has failed rectal tube, did not tolerate
   NG tube, sigmoidoscopy did not result in decompression for any
   sustained period, and high risk for neostigmine given bradycardia and
   risk of heart block.
   - weekly KUBs (tomorrow)
   .
   # ESLD: Not transplant candidate given active drinking.  Plans to have
   transplant eval at [**Hospital1 **].  [**Month (only) 11**] now have hepatorenal syndrome which will
   not be helped by acute blood loss
   - transplant eval at [**Hospital1 **] on discharge
   - measure bladder pressures to r/o compartment syndrome as ascites
   reaccumulates
   - Liver following
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely 2/2 HRS
   - continue midodrine, octreotide
   - appreciate renal recs
   .
   # Diarrhea - Chronic, likely combination of lactulose and
   nonobstructing ileus. Colonic ileus is stable by CT and KUB. non-gap
   metabolic acidosis continues, but still likely related to diarrhea.
   Patient ambulating to bedside commode without problems. [**Name (NI) **] negative

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing blood loss and coagulopathy: The patient has experienced bleeding from multiple sites, including the penis, abdomen, and rectum. The low hemoglobin levels and hematocrit indicate significant blood loss, which can lead to hypotension and shock.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis, which increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition causes altered mental status and can manifest as asterixis (flapping tremor).

3. Respiratory complications: The patient has evidence of pleural effusions and basal atelectasis on imaging. These findings suggest potential respiratory compromise, and the patient may require interventions such as chest physiotherapy or mechanical ventilation.

4. Infection: The presence of diarrhea, along with nonobstructing ileus, raises concerns about possible infections or sepsis. Monitoring of laboratory parameters, including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and blood cultures, would be important to identify any infectious processes.

5. Renal failure: The patient is likely experiencing hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), as indicated by the presence of ascites and acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and management of fluid balance will be necessary.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He has been hospitalized for colonic pseudoobstruction and underwent endoscopic decompression. The patient also had a traumatic foley placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma status post embolization.

The patient's current condition includes acute blood loss anemia, multiple sources with reexpansion of chest wall hematoma, and GU bleeding. He is hemostatic but complicated by comorbid ESLD coagulopathy and likely disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to acute blood loss anemia.
2. Continued bleeding from the paracentesis site or other sources.
3. Development of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Esophageal variceal bleeding.
5. Acute renal failure due to hepatorenal syndrome.
6. Infection, particularly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), given the positive urine analysis for enterococcus.
7. Complications related to the traumatic foley placement, such as ongoing oozing from the urethra.
8. Recurrence of colonic pseudoobstruction.
9. Progression of ESLD.
10. Potential need for liver transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has multiple sources of bleeding, including reexpansion of chest wall hematoma, GU bleeding, and possibly GI bleeding. Close monitoring of Hct is recommended, and transfusion should be considered for Hct < 21% or <25% if active rebleeding occurs.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has ESLD coagulopathy and a positive lupus anticoagulant. Frequent coagulation monitoring is necessary, and appropriate measures such as FFP for INR > 2, cryo for fibrinogen < 100, and DDAVP or amicar may be required to control bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcohol cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He has been hospitalized for colonic pseudoobstruction, traumatic foley placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma. The patient's current condition includes acute blood loss anemia, coagulopathy, urinary tract infection, traumatic foley placement, colonic pseudoobstruction, end-stage liver disease, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate acute blood loss anemia. Monitoring hemoglobin levels regularly and transfusing blood products as needed are essential to manage this condition.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy due to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a positive lupus anticoagulant. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate use of blood products, including fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, and desmopressin (DDAVP), are necessary.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine analysis indicating a UTI. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be continued, and urine culture results should be followed up for targeted antibiotic treatment.

4. Traumatic foley placement: The patient continues to experience oozing from the urethra around the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of ETOH cirrhosis, presenting with hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He has had a lengthy hospital course for colonic pseudoobstruction, traumatic foley placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma. The patient's current condition is acute blood loss anemia, which has been stabilized with supportive therapy and blood transfusions. However, he is also complicated by comorbid ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) coagulopathy and possible superimposed DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low due to ongoing blood loss. Close monitoring of hematocrit (Hct) is necessary, and transfusion of blood products may be required to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
2. ESLD coagulopathy: The patient's liver disease has led to impaired clotting function, increasing the risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters such as prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) is essential. Administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate may be needed to correct the coagulopathy.
3. Possible superimposed DIC: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis, complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, and coagulopathy. He has been hospitalized for colonic pseudoobstruction, traumatic Foley placement, bleeding from paracentesis site, and chest wall hematoma. The patient was transferred back to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring in the setting of acute blood loss anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have dropped significantly, indicating acute blood loss. Close monitoring of Hct is required, and transfusion may be necessary if Hct falls below 21% or 25% during active bleeding.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy due to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a positive lupus anticoagulant. He has required desmopressin (DDAVP) and tranexamic acid (Amicar) in the past. Frequent coagulation monitoring is needed, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate should be given for an elevated INR > 2 or fibrinogen < 100, respectively.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine analysis (U/A) and dysuria, indicating a UTI. Empiric ampicillin"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**10-28**]
   - HCT dropped from 23 to 20.5.  Transfused 1 u PRBC and 1 u cryo.  HCT
   bumped to 22.3.
   - Heme clarified the the factor inhibitor on the screen is lupus
   anticoagulant, which should not be associated with bleeding.  Bleeding
   is felt to be due to liver-related factor deficiencies and chronic
   DIC.  Recommended cryo, FFP.  Would avoid Amicar.
   - Liver reported that they are still evaluating him for transplant.
   This will mainly depend on if he has enough social support.  If he
   does, then Liver will discuss with Transplant Surgery.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of alcoholism-related liver cirrhosis, presenting with multiple complications. He has been admitted to the ICU for acute blood loss anemia due to ongoing bleeding from various sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary system, and chest wall hematoma. The patient has undergone endoscopic decompression for colonic pseudoobstruction, embolization for chest wall hematoma, and placement of a Foley catheter. He is currently being monitored for hemodynamic stability and receiving supportive therapy with blood transfusions and coagulation factors.

1. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate acute blood loss, which can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels is essential.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy due to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and a positive lupus anticoagulant. This can increase the risk of bleeding and make it difficult to control any bleeding episodes. Regular coagulation studies should be performed, and appropriate interventions such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, or DDAVP may be required.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine analysis and dysuria, suggesting a UTI. Empiric antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and further"
