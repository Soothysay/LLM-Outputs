","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU following pre-AVR catheterization and was found to have clean arteries without any intervention needed. The patient is scheduled for CABG surgery on [**8-14**] and plans to be discharged on [**8-10**] at noon, with a return on [**8-14**] at 6AM. The patient agrees with the plan and is currently stable with no complaints. 

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/73 to 150/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and weighs 64 kg, with a height of 66 inches. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,120 mL and output of 2,000 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -880 mL. The patient's blood products, urine output, NG output, and drain outputs are also noted. 

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is not receiving supplemental oxygen and has an SpO2 of 98%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2 of 128 mmHg, HCO3- of 26 mEq/L, BE of -5 mEq/L, and SaO2 of 95%. 

The physical examination findings, including peripheral vascular assessment, skin, neurologic examination, and other systems, are not assessed at this time. 

The lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), D-dimer, lactate, LDH, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4). The remaining lab values are within normal ranges. 

The assessment and plan include pulmonary edema and aortic stenosis. The ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and comments regarding communication and code status. The patient's disposition is noted as well. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include pulmonary edema, aortic stenosis, and the risks associated with CABG surgery. It is crucial to monitor the patient closely for any signs of respiratory distress, cardiac complications, bleeding, infection, or other postoperative issues."

   Assessment and Plan
 PULMONARY EDEMA
 CRITICAL AORTIC STENOSIS
   This is an 80 year old male with a history of critical AS (peak
   velocity 5.2 m/s, peak gradient 106 mmHg, [**Location (un) **] .8 cm2) presenting with
   acute onset of shortness of breath this morning consistent with CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Shortness of breath:  Likely secondary to congestive heart failure as
   patient has signs of fluid overload on imaging and BNP=7739.  Patient
   required CPAP to maintain sats in ED, but was quickly weaned to room
   air after diuresis.  Differential includes flash pulmonary edema, PE,
   and pneumonia.  PE has been ruled out after negative CTA.  Pneumonia
   seems less likely given the acuity of onset of shortness of breath
   without prodromal syptoms.  Although he does have an unexplained WBC
   count of 17.2 and an ill defined lingular opacity on CT, he does not
   look clinically infected.  Regarding the cause, he does have severe
   aortic stenosis (albeit with a normal EF and adequate pulse pressure),
   so a small insult could throw him into failure.  Ischemia is on the
   differential, but no CP or EKG changes.  He does have evidence of
   infection that may have tipped him over.
   - Blood cultures and urine culture pending

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of critical aortic stenosis, presenting with acute onset shortness of breath and signs of fluid overload. He has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient's shortness of breath is likely secondary to congestive heart failure, as evidenced by his elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 7739. Other differential diagnoses considered include flash pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia. However, PE has been ruled out after a negative computed tomography angiography (CTA), and pneumonia seems less likely given the acuity of onset and absence of prodromal symptoms. Although the patient has an elevated white blood cell count and an ill-defined lingular opacity on CT, he does not appear clinically infected. The cause of his symptoms may be severe aortic stenosis, which can lead to heart failure. Ischemia is also on the differential, but no changes were observed on the cardiac catheterization or electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient has evidence of infection that may have contributed to his condition. He has received one dose of vancomycin intravenously and is currently being treated with diuretics to manage fluid overload. Blood cultures and urine culture results are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who presented with acute shortness of breath and was diagnosed with congestive heart failure exacerbation. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed critical aortic stenosis with clean coronary arteries. The patient also has signs of fluid overload and a high B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient already shows signs of fluid overload and has a high BNP level, indicating a high risk for pulmonary edema.
2. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has critical AS with severe narrowing of the aortic valve, which can lead to further complications such as syncope, angina, or heart failure.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Although the patient's coronary angiography showed no flow-limiting CAD, there are mild luminal irregularities in the coronary arteries, which could potentially progress and lead to CAD-related complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been running in the 90s to 110s since admission, indicating possible uncontrolled hypertension.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is currently on simvastatin 40mg for hyperlipidemia, but his lipid levels should be monitored regularly to prevent cardiovascular complications.
6. Spinal Stenosis: The patient is on celebrex 200mg for spinal stenosis pain management, and this condition may"

   required CPAP to maintain sats in ED, but was quickly weaned to room

   seems less likely given the acuity of onset of shortness of breath
   without pro-dromal symptoms.  Although he does have an unexplained WBC
   count of 17.2 and an ill defined lingular opacity on CT, he does not
   look clinically infected.  Regarding the cause, he does have severe

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History

   nothing to add,
   discharge home today, start beta blocker
   Total time spent on patient care: 50 minutes.
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with critical aortic stenosis (AS) and no significant coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient presented with acute onset of shortness of breath consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and underwent cardiac catheterization. The catheterization demonstrated clean coronary arteries and confirmed critical AS with peak velocity of 5.2 m/s, peak gradient of 106 mmHg, and aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2.

The patient's current vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/73 mmHg to 150/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 64 kg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 1120 mL and output of 2000 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -880 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress, oriented x3, with appropriate mood and affect. He has a harsh grade III systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border radiating to the carotids, but no thrills, lifts, or signs of heart failure. Minimal crackles are present at the bases, and there is 1+ bilateral edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 20 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, glucose of 110 mg/dL, and sodium/potassium levels within normal ranges. Other lab values such as liver function tests, amylase/lipase, D-dimer, lactic acid, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are also within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray shows no acute cardiopulmonary pathology, and a CT scan of the head without contrast was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's echocardiogram confirmed critical AS with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and adequate pulse pressure.

The patient's assessment and plan include pulmonary edema, critical aortic stenosis, and CHF exacerbation. The shortness of breath is likely secondary to congestive heart failure, with signs of fluid overload on imaging and a significantly elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 7739. The patient was treated with CPAP to maintain oxygen saturation in the emergency department but was quickly weaned to room air after diuresis.

The patient's medical history includes severe aortic stenosis confirmed by echocardiography in June 2022"

The patient is an 80-year-old male who presented with acute onset of shortness of breath, consistent with CHF exacerbation. The patient underwent pre-AVR cath that demonstrated clean arteries but critical AS. He is currently stable and has no complaints. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 135/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but no history of CAD or prior MI. He is on medication for these conditions.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for pulmonary edema, which has been confirmed by imaging and BNP levels. The patient required CPAP to maintain sats in the ED but was quickly weaned to room air after diuresis. The differential includes flash pulmonary edema, PE, and pneumonia, but PE has been ruled out after negative CTA. Pneumonia seems less likely given the acuity of onset of shortness of breath without prodromal symptoms.

The patient also has severe aortic stenosis but has never had syncope, angina, or CHF in the past. CT surgery has been scheduled for potential AVR. Carotid U/S and CXR (PA/Lateral) are planned before discharge. The"
