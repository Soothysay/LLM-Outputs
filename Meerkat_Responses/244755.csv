","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old male with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent septal ablation complicated by transient AV block and temporary pacing wire placement. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy s/p septal ablation: The patient is advised to have bedrest while the sheath is in place. Cardiac enzymes and serial EKGs are being trended. The patient is prescribed ASA 325 mg daily.

2. Complete Heart Block: This is a complication of the septal ablation that has since resolved. A temporary pacing wire is in place for 48 hours. Heparin gtt is being administered while the temporary wire is in place, aiming for a PTT of 50. Daily checks of the pacing wire's threshold are being conducted, with the most recent reading being 0.4. Serial EKGs are also being performed.

3. Dyslipidemia: The patient is to continue taking Lipitor.

4. EtOH use: The patient's EtOH use will be monitored with CIWA, and diazepam 5mg Q6H PRN CIWA > 10.

ICU care includes regular diet and glycemic control. The patient has two lines: Cordis/Introducer placed on 04/14/2186 at 07:00 PM and an 18 Gauge line placed on 04/14/2186 at 07:04 PM. Prophylaxis for DVT is being provided with heparin IV, and stress ulcer prophylaxis is also being administered.

The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently being held in the CCU.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and recent complete heart block, indicating potential cardiac rhythm disturbances.
2. Infection: The presence of multiple lines and the use of heparin increase the risk of infection, particularly catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Bleeding: The administration of heparin increases the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Kidney injury: The elevated creatinine level suggests a possible kidney injury.
5. Respiratory issues: The patient is on supplemental oxygen, indicating possible respiratory difficulties.
6. Thrombosis: The use of heparin as prophylaxis against DVT indicates concern for thrombotic events.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's cardiac status, observe for any signs of infection or bleeding, assess kidney function, ensure adequate oxygenation, and prevent thrombotic events."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent septal ablation. He experienced a transient AV block post-procedure and was temporarily paced. The patient's current complaints include chest pain, nausea, and a decrease in blood pressure, which improved after receiving morphine and ondansetron. Vital signs show sinus bradycardia, stable oxygen saturation, and within normal limits for temperature, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. The patient's physical examination reveals a crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the left sternal border and clear lung sounds. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low potassium levels, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient is currently on heparin, morphine, and other medications for his conditions. He is on bedrest with a temporary pacing wire in place, and his cardiac enzymes and EKGs will be monitored. The patient has a history of dyslipidemia and EtOH use, and appropriate management is planned. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to the CCU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged or recurrent complete heart block: The patient's history of transient AV block and temporary pacing wire in place suggest a risk for further complications related to heart rhythm abnormalities.
2. Infection at pacing wire insertion site: Given the invasive nature of the temporary pacing wire, there is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent septal ablation. Post-procedure, the patient experienced a transient AV block and required temporary pacing. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he is being monitored closely.

24-hour events include episodes of chest pain overnight, which were managed with morphine. The patient subsequently experienced nausea and a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) to the 80-90s. An examination revealed a pulsus paradox of 4, and the patient was given Zofran 4 mg IV along with normal saline (NS) 250 cc, resulting in improvement of symptoms.

Infusions include heparin sodium at a rate of 1,050 units/hour. The patient is also on other ICU medications and routine medications. No known drug allergies have been reported.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent symptoms mentioned.

Flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight decrease in SBP but remains within normal limits. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 957 mL, output of 357 mL via IVF and 197 mL via TF, with a urine output of 600 mL. Blood products have not been administered.

Physical examination reveals a well-dressed and oriented patient with no signs of pallor or cyanosis. The neck is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's main concern is experiencing complete heart block, for which temporary pacing has been provided. There is a discussion regarding the possibility of needing a permanent pacemaker if recovery of conduction does not occur. The patient's CK level peaked at 425 and Troponin T is still rising. The patient's dyspnea has resolved, and a chest X-ray showed no significant changes. An echocardiogram revealed moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, normal right ventricular chamber size, and normal free wall motion. The aortic and mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but there is no aortic stenosis or regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation is present. The patient has no known drug allergies, and all other medical history remains unchanged. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete heart block: The patient is currently experiencing complete heart block, which can lead to severe complications if not properly managed. Temporary pacing has been provided, but if recovery of conduction does not occur, the patient may require a permanent pacemaker.
2. Myocardial injury: Elevated CK and Troponin T levels suggest myocardial injury, indicating possible damage to the heart muscle. Monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent an alcohol septal ablation. The procedure was successful in reducing the gradient, but it was complicated by a transient AV block. Currently, the patient is in complete heart block and has a temporary pacing wire in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete heart block: The patient's current condition of being in complete heart block is a potential complication that may require a permanent pacemaker if recovery of conduction does not occur.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Due to the patient's history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the recent alcohol septal ablation, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock if the heart function deteriorates further.
3. Arrhythmias: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the procedure itself increase the risk of various arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
4. Myocardial ischemia or infarction: The combination of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the septal ablation increases the risk of myocardial ischemia or infarction, which can lead to further complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The presence of temporary pacing wires increases the risk of infection, including bacterial infection of the pacemaker site.

Please note that this summary and list of potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent an alcohol septal ablation. The procedure was successful in reducing the gradient, but it was complicated by transient AV block. The patient is now experiencing complete heart block and has been placed on temporary pacing wires with a backup setting of VVI 30. The patient's CK levels peaked at 425, and troponin T levels are still rising. The patient's dyspnea has resolved, and the chest X-ray remains unchanged.

   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
   systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-4-14**], findings
   are similar. There is mild LVH, moder significant LVH at the basal

","Summary:
- The patient is a 43-year-old male with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent an alcohol septal ablation.
- Post-procedure, the patient developed a complete heart block, which has persisted until the current date.
- The patient is currently on temporary pacing with a ventricular demand pacemaker (VVI) set at 30 beats per minute.
- Heparin infusion is being administered to maintain a target PTT of 50 seconds.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes, particularly Troponin-T, are still rising.
- The patient's chest X-ray is unchanged from the previous day, and he experienced moderate dyspnea yesterday evening, which resolved spontaneously.
- An echocardiogram reveals moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, normal right ventricular size and motion, mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets without aortic stenosis or regurgitation, mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets with systolic anterior motion, and mild mitral regurgitation.
- The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, and elevated troponin levels.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/62 mmHg to 131/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent septal ablation and experienced transient AV block, for which a temporary pacing wire was placed. He is currently on bedrest while the sheath is in place. The patient's cardiac enzymes and EKGs are being monitored, and he is taking ASA 325 mg daily.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: This condition can lead to complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.
2. Complications related to septal ablation: These may include bleeding, infection, or damage to adjacent structures.
3. Complete heart block: The patient previously experienced this condition, which can result in slow or irregular heart rhythms. It may require permanent pacemaker placement if it does not revert within 24 hours.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and the presence of a pacing wire.
5. Disopyramide management: The patient is currently holding disopyramide, a medication used to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Restarting it should be discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4235**].
6. EtOH use: Monitoring for alcohol use and potential withdrawal symptoms is necessary. Diazepam will be given as needed for CIWA scores greater"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to the presence of medical devices such as the pacing wire and potential breaks in sterile technique during procedures.
2. Bleeding: With the use of anticoagulant therapy (heparin), there is a risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the recent bleeding/pain in the groin site after pulling himself up in bed.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and complete heart block increases the risk of arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, which could be life-threatening.
4. Device-related complications: During the pacemaker implantation, there is a risk of complications such as lead dislodgment, battery malfunction, or infection related to the device.
5. Respiratory issues: The patient's decreased lung volumes on chest X-ray suggest a reduced inspiratory effort, which could lead to respiratory distress or pneumonia if not managed appropriately."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent septal ablation. The patient experienced complete heart block as a complication of the procedure and has been on temporary pacing. He is currently experiencing right knee pain without any trauma or prior history, with pain only during movement. The patient also has dyslipidemia and a history of EtOH use.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/62 mmHg to 122/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 83 kg, and he is receiving various infusions and medications.

The physical examination reveals a crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the left lower sternal border, which is augmented by clenching fists. The patient has transvenous pacing wire in the right groin without edema, hematoma, or bruit. His right knee shows tenderness in the suprapatellar region with limited range of motion, particularly with plantar extension and internal rotation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Troponin-T levels are within normal range, and other"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He underwent septal ablation and is now experiencing complete heart block (CHB). The temporary pacemaker rate was increased to 60 BPM due to symptoms associated with a slower heart rate. The plan is to implant a permanent pacemaker (PPM) tomorrow. The patient requires critical care management for complete heart block, bradycardia, and temporary pacemaker. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.

2. Stroke: Complete heart block can lead to inadequate blood flow to the brain, increasing the risk of ischemic stroke.

3. Cardiac tamponade: In rare cases, complications from the temporary pacemaker insertion or the underlying cardiomyopathy may result in cardiac tamponade, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid around the heart.

4. Infection: The presence of lines and devices increases the risk of infection, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or device-related infections.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting can predispose the patient to develop blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if they dislodge.
