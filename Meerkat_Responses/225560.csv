   MEDICAL ATTENDING ADMIT ADDENDUM
   I examined the patient and reiviewed his history and pertinent labs.  I
   was physically present with the MICU team during the key portions of
   the services provided. I agree with the note above, including the
   assessment and plan. I would emphasize and add the following:
   The patient has expected post op pain,  clearly improved with PCA, and
   has little other complaints.  His normal SBP is 110.
   On exam: His SBP is in the 80s and HR in the 120s, though he looks very
   comfortable other than his abdomen. Lungs clear.  Cor- RRR but tachy;
   Ext- no edema; Neuro
 a&o GU- scant urine in Foley; Abd
 as above
   thin brownish fluid saturating the gauze dressing of one of his wounds
   Lab: as above.  CxR
 clear except for +/- LLL atelectasis
   \
   Problems:
   1.       S/p ex lap and take down of entero cutaneous fistulae with
   ileostomy
   2.       Post op hypotension, tachycardia, and oliguria
 abdominal
   sepsis vs volume depletion from gut third space losses vs both
   3.       Hx of multiple cancers ( GB, appendix, gastric, colon)
   Plan:
   1.       Aggressive IV fluids, aiming for UO> 30cc/hr and SBP>90
   2.       Agree with A line
   3.       Agree with change in antibiotics to Zosyn and Vanco
   4.       [**Month (only) 51**] need central line , but for now his SCL portacath and 16 g
   PIV are sufficing for IVF
   5.       Appreciate surgery following his wound closely, esp what they
   believe is a seroma draining
   6.       Recheck CXR if any  increased SOB
   7.       Consider serum cortisol if BP doesn
t respond to 4-6 L of
   fluids

","Summary:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, who underwent right colectomy and fistula takedown.
- He presented with persistent hypotension despite intravenous fluid resuscitation and was transferred to the ICU.
- The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 110-120 bpm, blood pressure in the 80s, respiratory rate of 12-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- Physical examination revealed a warm and well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, and tenderness in the midline incision with wet packing, pooling seroma, ostomy bag in place with minimal output, and erythema around the former fistula site.
- Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hematocrit of 30.9%, platelet count of 120 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, glucose level of 104 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels.
- The patient's condition was assessed as post-operative hypotension with a rising WBC count, concerning for septic versus hypovolemic shock.
- The plan includes trend serial lactates, IV fluids to achieve target urine output, blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure goals, transfusion for hematocrit below 30, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and follow-up blood and urine cultures.
- Other issues include colon"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer who underwent right colectomy and subsequent procedures for an abscess fistula. He presents to the ICU with persistent hypotension, despite receiving intravenous fluids and blood transfusions. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. His white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. The patient has a history of hypertension, gout, and gastric cancer. He is experiencing nausea and right lower quadrant pain but denies other symptoms. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include septic shock, hypovolemic shock, anastomotic leak, surgical site infection, or line infection. The patient's rising WBC count and hypotension suggest a potential septic etiology, possibly originating from the abdomen. The hematocrit is stable, ruling out hemorrhagic shock. The plan includes administering broad-spectrum antibiotics, ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation, monitoring trends in lactate levels, and considering surgical intervention to relook at the anastomosis."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer who underwent a colectomy and fistula takedown. The patient is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypotension, increased white blood cell count, acute renal failure, and the need for pressor requirements. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 106/75 mmHg and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a tender abdomen but no other complaints. Laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level of 1.4, decreased hemoglobin concentration of 26, and an increased white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Post-enterocutaneous fistula takedown hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to third spacing into the abdomen, bleeding into the abdomen, and/or abdominal sepsis.
2. Renal insufficiency: The decreased blood pressure during surgery may have caused renal insufficiency.
3. Anemia: The patient may have anemia due to dilution from fluid resuscitation.
4. Post-operative pain: The patient is experiencing post-operative pain, which needs to be managed appropriately.
5. Anastomotic leak: Although the patient's wounds look clear, there is a concern for anastomotic leak due to the rising white blood cell count and hypotension.
6. Sepsis: The patient's increased white"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual who is anxious. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 106/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has been receiving multiple fluid boluses for mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, as well as norepinephrine infusion at 0.03 mcg/kg/min. The patient has also been on various ICU medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), and has been given antibiotics such as metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently at 106/75 mmHg, indicating hypotension. This could be due to the ongoing fluid resuscitation and the use of vasopressor support with norepinephrine.

2. Increased White Blood Cell (WBC) Count: The patient's WBC count has increased from 13.1 to 16.1 K/uL. This increase may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation within the body.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient has received a"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer who underwent a right colectomy. He is currently in the ICU on postoperative day (POD) #3, following an exploratory laparotomy, fistula takedown, and resection of the anastomosis. 

The patient has been experiencing hypotension and required pressors. He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with a hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 26%. The abdominal wound culture grew [Last Name (LF) 1685], and linezolid has been added to his antibiotic regimen. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/64 mmHg to 130/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 11.0 to 16.1 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin (Hct) of 26.1%, platelet count (Plt) of 82 thousand/mm³, creatinine (Cr) of 1.3 mg/dL, glucose of 104 mg/dL, and an elevated lactate level of 2.1 mmol/L. Other lab results indicate abnormalities in electrolyte levels and coagulation parameters. 

The patient's abdominal exam is stable, and his wounds appear clean. He is expected to be transferred to the floor today, pending stability. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include postoperative hypotension, sepsis due to persistent drain output from an abscess fistula, acute renal failure, and possible line-related infections."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, who underwent right colectomy and fistula takedown surgery. He presented with persistent drain output from an abscess fistula. The patient has been experiencing post-operative hypotension, increasing white blood cell count, acute renal failure, and pressor requirements. He also has a tender abdomen but no worsening symptoms that would suggest anastomotic leak. His wounds appear clear, and he seems euvolemic with low oxygen requirements. He is currently on antibiotics.

Plan:
1. Continue fluid boluses as needed.
2. Continue Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) antibiotics.
3. Follow up blood cultures, temperature curve, and white blood cell count.
4. Touch base with the surgery team.
5. Transfuse 1 unit of red blood cells.
6. Plan for electrolyte management and hematocrit repletion.
7. Monitor urine output and trends in creatinine levels.
8. Consider repeat imaging for anastomotic leak if there are rising white blood cell counts and hypotension.

Other assessments and plans include:
- Acute renal failure due to hypotension during surgery.
- Monitoring for signs of oliguria and analyzing urine for electrolytes and presence of granular casts.
- Trending creatinine levels and monitoring urine output.
- Colon cancer status post colectomy and fistula takedown.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of colon cancer, who underwent right colectomy and had persistent drain output from an abscess fistula. The patient then underwent exploratory laparotomy, fistula takedown, and resection of the anastomosis. He is currently in the post-operative period (POD#3). The patient presented with hypotension and required multiple fluid boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Pressors were initially used but have since been discontinued with the patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) stable in the 130s. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a hematocrit (Hct) of 26 and is currently stable. Acute renal failure (ARF) is resolving, as indicated by a creatinine level of 1.0. Flagyl was discontinued after consulting with infectious disease (ID) yesterday. The patient has allergies to aspirin and morphine, which cause nausea and vomiting. The last doses of antibiotics (metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin) were administered on 08/31/2176 at 11:47 AM, 09/01/2176 at 12:15 AM, and 02:07 AM, respectively.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who underwent an exploratory laparotomy on August 30th for the takedown of a fistula. He experienced postoperative hypotension and has been experiencing sepsis, which has been transient and has not evolved into sustained SIRS. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable off pressors and is being planned for transfer to the surgical floor. The patient's acute renal failure has improved, likely due to a pre-renal insult. He has colon cancer, is postoperative from the above procedure, and will be managed with pain control using PCA. The patient has been receiving antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam), and there are preliminary findings of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) on culture, which requires further discussion and consideration of adding linezolid. The patient's blood glucose levels need to be monitored and managed, and he is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. His arterial and central lines are in place, and he is being closely monitored for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is still at risk for sepsis due to the presence of VRE on culture. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is necessary.
2. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's acute renal failure has improved, ongoing monitoring of renal function and urine output is essential.
3. Colon Cancer: The patient's colon cancer will require further management and treatment per the primary team.
4. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia due to being on mechanical ventilation. Regular respiratory assessments and surveillance are needed.
5. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be continued.
6. Stress Ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and surgery. Prophylactic proton pump inhibitors should be continued to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Line Infections: The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line and a central line, which increase the risk of infection. Regular line assessments and surveillance are necessary."
