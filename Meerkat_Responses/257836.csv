   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dilated
   cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU for marked hypoxia, likely [**1-25**] CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress
 Initially thought to be [**1-25**] PE, now thought to
   be [**1-25**] CHF exacerbation.
   - Continue supplemental O2 with BiPAP.
   - Continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses.  Expect improved hypoxia
   with continued diuresis.
   - Empiric abx therapy for ?PNA with azithromycin.
   - Send induced sputum cx.
   - Restart heparin gtt for ostensible treatment of acute vs. chronic PE
   pending LE DVT, final read of CTA.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient had a coronary cath in [**2170**] which showed no
   evidence of CAD.  The patient has multiple risk factors including
   hypertension, hyperlipidema, and tobacco abuse.  EKG does not show
   evidence of acute ischemia.  Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes x 3.
   - Continue aspirin and statin
   - EKG daily
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, likely
   associated to alcohol abuse, with previously documented NYHA class I
   symptoms.  On echo today, the patient has decreased systolic function
   with EF documented 25-30% with no new wall motion abnormalities.  It is
   possible that the patient is experiencing volume overload causing
   symptoms of respiratory distress.  Will continue diuresis with IV
   lasix.
   - Restarted home [**Last Name (un) 239**] at lower dose (valsartan 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]).  Will restart
   metoprolol.
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Goal diuresis approx. 2 to 2.5 L.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   -          Restart B-blocker
   .
   # Alcohol Abuse:  CIWA PRN with ativan.  Replete magnesium PRN.
   .
   # EtOH Cirrhosis:  LFTs on arrival.  Will avoid hepatotoxic
   medications.
   .
   # Chronic Kidney disease:  Crn 1.1 on arrival.  Following contrast
   load, will monitor Crn closely.
   .
   # Hypertension:  Valsartan and metoprolol have been started and will be
   uptitrated as tolerated.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dilated cardiomyopathy. He was admitted to the CCU for marked hypoxia, likely due to a CHF exacerbation. 

The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and was initially thought to have a pulmonary embolism (PE), but is now believed to be experiencing a CHF exacerbation. The respiratory support includes supplemental O2 with BiPAP, and diuresis with IV lasix boluses has been continued due to high pressures. 

Empiric antibiotic therapy has been started for possible pneumonia (PNA) with azithromycin, and an induced sputum culture has been sent. Heparin gtt has been restarted for the treatment of acute versus chronic PE, pending the results of a lower extremity (LE) DVT and final read of the computed tomography angiography (CTA). 

Regarding the patient's coronary arteries, a coronary catheterization was performed in [**2170**] which showed no evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the patient has multiple risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco abuse. EKG does not show evidence of acute ischemia, and cardiac enzymes have been ruled out for myocardial infarction (MI) three times. Aspirin and a statin have been continued, and daily EKGs will be monitored"

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress and hypoxia, along with the history of CHF exacerbation, suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. This condition occurs when fluid accumulates in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: Given the patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and decreased systolic function, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock. This condition occurs when the heart fails to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

3. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy increases the risk of arrhythmias. Monitoring the patient's heart rhythm is important to detect any abnormalities.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.1, and there may be a further risk of AKI due to the contrast load from the coronary catheterization. Close monitoring of renal function is essential.

5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and liver function test results indicate a possibility of liver dysfunction. Hepatic encephalopathy is a potential complication that can occur due to liver disease.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for DVT due to immobilization"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dilated
   cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU for marked hypoxia, likely [**1-25**] CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress
 Initially thought to be [**1-25**] PE, now thought to
   be [**1-25**] CHF exacerbation.
   - Continue supplemental O2 with NC now down to 4L.
   - Continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses PRN.  Expect improved hypoxia
   with continued diuresis.
   - Empiric abx therapy for PNA with azithromycin 5d course to end [**10-27**].
   - Send induced sputum cx.
   - D/C
d heparin drip.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient had a coronary cath in [**2170**] which showed no
   evidence of CAD.  The patient has multiple risk factors including
   hypertension, hyperlipidema, and tobacco abuse.  EKG does not show
   evidence of acute ischemia.  Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes x 3.
   - Continue aspirin and statin
   - EKG daily
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, likely
   associated to alcohol abuse, with previously documented NYHA class I
   symptoms.  On echo, the patient has decreased systolic function with EF
   documented 25-30% with no new wall motion abnormalities.  It likely
   that the patient is experiencing volume overload causing symptoms of
   respiratory distress.  Will continue diuresis with IV lasix.
   - Restarted home [**Last Name (un) 239**] at lower dose (valsartan 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]).  Carvedilol
   added for better BP benefit.
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Goal diuresis approx. 2 to 2.5 L.
   .
   #Leukocytosis:  WBC trending up slowly, currently not on 24hours of
   Abx.
   -          Will continue abx for now, f/u cx results.
   -          f/u diff
   # RHYTHM:  The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   -          Continue carvedilol
   .
   # Alcohol Abuse:  CIWA PRN with ativan.  Replete magnesium PRN.
          - counseled against alcohol use today
   .
   # EtOH Cirrhosis:  LFTs on arrival.  Will avoid hepatotoxic
   medications.
   .
   # Chronic Kidney disease:  Crn 1.1 on arrival.  Following contrast
   load, will monitor Crn closely (1.3 today.)
   .
   # Hypertension:  Valsartan and Carvedilol have been started and will be
   uptitrated as tolerated.
   .
# Hyperlipidemia: On [**2179-8-5**], his total cholesterol was 143, HDL 71, LDL 56.  C
ontinue statin.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dilated cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU for marked hypoxia, likely exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF). 

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient started on carvedilol 6.25 mg PO/NG and azithromycin for atypical coverage.
- Urine legionella and flu were negative.
- All cultures, HIV, and minibal are pending.
- LE US - initial read no DVT, will restart heparin with final read.
- Off BIPAP, tolerating NC well on 6L.
- Continue diuresis -1.6 L at 4pm, 5pm lytes checked, given additional dose of lasix, checking [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
- CTA - final: No pulmonary embolus. No aortic dissection. Diffuse central perihilar ground-glass opacification, bilateral pleural effusions, non-bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary artery hypertension is most consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- Recommend rescan after treatment to ensure no underlying process.
- Vascular including dense coronary artery calcifications. Apparent thickening of left atrial appendage may be artifactual due to wall apposition or could represent thrombus. Correlation with clinical history and echocardiogram suggested."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dilated
   cardiomyopathy admitted to the CCU for marked hypoxia, likely [**1-25**] CHF
   exacerbation.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress
 Initially thought to be [**1-25**] PE, now thought to
   be [**1-25**] CHF exacerbation.
   - Continue supplemental O2 with NC.
   - Continue diuresis with IV lasix boluses.  Expect improved hypoxia
   with continued diuresis.
   - Empiric abx therapy for ?PNA with azithromycin.
   - Send induced sputum cx.
   - Restart heparin gtt if final read of LE Doppler is suddenly +.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  The patient had a coronary cath in [**2170**] which showed no
   evidence of CAD.  The patient has multiple risk factors including
   hypertension, hyperlipidema, and tobacco abuse.  EKG does not show
   evidence of acute ischemia.  Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes x 3.
   - Continue aspirin and statin
   - EKG daily
   .
   # PUMP:  The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, likely
   associated to alcohol abuse, with previously documented NYHA class I
   symptoms.  On echo, the patient has decreased systolic function with EF
   documented 25-30% with no new wall motion abnormalities.  It likely
   that the patient is experiencing volume overload causing symptoms of
   respiratory distress.  Will continue diuresis with IV lasix.
   - Restarted home [**Last Name (un) 239**] at lower dose (valsartan 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]).  Will restart
   metoprolol.
   - Monitor I/Os and daily weights
   - Goal diuresis approx. 2 to 2.5 L.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   -          Restart B-blocker
   .
   # Alcohol Abuse:  CIWA PRN with ativan.  Replete magnesium PRN.
   .
   # EtOH Cirrhosis:  LFTs on arrival.  Will avoid hepatotoxic
   medications.
   .
   # Chronic Kidney disease:  Crn 1.1 on arrival.  Following contrast
   load, will monitor Crn closely (1.3 today.)
   .
   # Hypertension:  Valsartan and metoprolol(restart) have been started
   and will be uptitrated as tolerated.
   .
# Hyperlipidemia: On [**2179-8-5**], his total cholesterol was 143, HDL 71, LDL 56.  C
ontinue statin.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and dilated cardiomyopathy. He was admitted to the CCU for marked hypoxia, likely due to a CHF exacerbation. 

The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and was thought to have a pulmonary embolism (PE), but it is now believed to be a CHF exacerbation. The respiratory distress has been attributed to volume overload, possibly caused by the patient's dilated cardiomyopathy. 

The patient is being treated with supplemental oxygen, diuretics (IV lasix), and antibiotics (azithromycin) for possible pneumonia. He is also on aspirin and a statin for coronary artery disease risk management, and his medications for heart failure (valsartan and metoprolol) have been restarted at lower doses.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated troponin T levels. His electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium levels.

The patient has chronic kidney disease with a creatinine level of 1.1 on admission, which increased to 1.3 after a contrast load. His liver function tests are normal, and he has a history of alcohol abuse.

The patient's EKG does not show evidence of acute ischemia, and cardiac enzymes have been ruled out for myocardial infarction (MI"
