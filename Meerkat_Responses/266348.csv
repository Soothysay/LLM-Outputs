   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80M with a history of CVA, who presents with pneumonia
   with sepsis physiology and significant hypernatremia.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely etiology is from PNA seen on CXR. Has a
   leukocytosis with a left shift on differential.  Was admitted on a NRB,
   but has been weened down to 5L NC.  Hypotension on admission, but is
   markedly hypernatremic, so hypovolumia likely more to plan than from
   peripheral dilitation of vaculature. Patient was given levo/CTX/flagyl
   in ED.
   - send off sputum cultures and urine legionella
   - will add on vanc as lives in nursing home, and continue levoflox
   - aggressive fluid [**Known lastname 6076**], and pressors if necessary to keep MAP
   > 65
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Possibly due to pna, versus UTI
   #. Hypernatremia:  Unclear etiology, but likely from poor PO intake
   with insensible loses.  No history of gastrointestinal losses.  Would
   need to consider central or DI or dysregulation of thirst centers.
   Patient weighs 90 kg, so has a free water deficit 4.8 L.  Would ideally
   give 120ml of d5W per hour to correct patient within 56 hrs so as to
   not cause dangerous fluid shifts with correction.  However, given need
   for rapid fluid [**Last Name (LF) 6076**], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] use 1/2 NS and matain close eye on
   sodium so as to not be lowered is by &#8804;0.5 meq/L per hour and no
   more than by 12 meq/L per day.  Likely etiology of altered mental
   status.
   - fluid correction with 1/2NS
   - will check urine osms
   #.  Lethargy:  Likely etilogy is from significant hypernatremia.  Also
   could be compounded from PNA.  UA shows no evidence of UTI.  With
   altered mental status and infection, would consider meningitis.  No
   nucall rigidity, and seems less likely at this time.
   - correct hypernatremia and treat PNA as given above.
   #. Renal failure:  Most likely from pre-renal, with low CVP and exam
   consistent with dehyrdation.  Other etiologies could be post-renal
   failure with history of BPH.  No great derangments on UA.  Unclear
   baseline.
   - recheck after fluid resusitation, if not normalizing, proceed with
   further work up.
   #. Hypercalcemia: Patient with history of paget's disease.  Likely
   hypercalcemia exacerbated by dehydration.  Will follow with fluid
   resusitation.
   #. CHF: currently hypovolemic.  Has [**1-8**]+ MR on prior TTE.  Will hold
   metoprolol and lasix in the setting of infection.
   #.  Hypothyroidism: cont sythroid
   #.  Hx of Stroke: cont ASA 81mg, could discuss increasing dose with
   PCP.
   #.  Schizoaffective disorder:  on Wellbutrin, zyprexa, and remeron as
   outpatient.  Will hold in the setting of altered mental status.
   #. FEN: replete lytes prn, will need S/S study, but will give pureed
   diet for now.
   #. PPX: Sc heparin, fall precautions, bowel regimen prn, PPI blocker
   with hx of GERD
   #. ACCESS: RIJ
   #. CODE STATUS: DNR but okay to intubate.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA who presents with pneumonia with sepsis physiology and significant hypernatremia. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65. The patient's hypernatremia may be due to poor oral intake and insensible losses, but further investigation is needed to determine the exact etiology.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with pneumonia and sepsis physiology indicates a high risk for sepsis-related complications. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and infection control measures will be crucial.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is significantly elevated, which can lead to neurologic complications such as altered mental status, lethargy, and potential central nervous system dysfunction. Careful correction of sodium levels is necessary to avoid rapid shifts that could worsen the patient's condition.

3. Renal failure: The patient's low CVP and dehydration signs suggest pre-renal failure. However, other etiologies like post-renal failure should also be considered. Regular monitoring of renal function and urine output is essential.

4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's history of Paget's disease may contribute to elevated calcium levels. This condition can increase the risk of kidney stones, bone deformities, and complications related to fluid"

","Summary:
- Mr. [**Known lastname **], an 80-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), presents with pneumonia and sepsis physiology.
- He has significant hypernatremia, likely due to poor oral intake and insensible losses.
- The patient is in the intensive care unit (ICU) and requires close monitoring.
- He is currently receiving intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor support.
- Potential medical complications include sepsis, hypernatremia, renal failure, anemia, hypercalcemia, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypothyroidism, and schizoaffective disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with pneumonia and sepsis physiology. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to manage this condition.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has significant hypernatremia, which could be due to poor oral intake and insensible losses. Careful correction of sodium levels is required to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome.
3. Renal failure: Pre-renal causes of renal failure should be considered, along with post-renal failure due to a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Monitoring kidney function and adjusting fluid management accordingly is essential.
4. Anemia: A drop in hemoglobin concentration from 45% on admission to 31% suggests anemia. Further evaluation and management are necessary"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80M with a history of CVA, who presents with pneumonia
   with sepsis physiology and significant hypernatremia.
   #. Sepsis:  Most likely etiology is from PNA seen on CXR. Has a
   leukocytosis with a neutrophilic predominance on differential.  Was
   admitted on a NRB, but has been weaned down to 5L NC.  Hypotension on
   admission, but is markedly hypernatremic, so hypovolumia likely more to
   plan than from peripheral dilitation of vaculature. Patient was given
   levo/CTX/flagyl in ED, continued on vanc/zosyn in MICU.
   - recheck CV O2 sat
   - continue NS boluses as needed for intravascular volume expansion with
   goal MAP > 65
   - continue vanc/zosyn given risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   #. Hypernatremia:  Unclear etiology, but likely from poor PO intake
   with insensible loses.  No history of gastrointestinal losses.  Would
   need to consider central or DI or dysregulation of thirst centers.
   Patient weighs 90 kg and had a free water deficit of 7 L at
   presentation.
   - correct sodium at 1/2 mEq per hour with D5W at 150 cc/hr
   - trend chemistries tid
   - check urine osmoles
   - consider Duboff placement for free water boluses after discussion
   with family
   #. Renal failure:  Most likely from pre-renal, with low CVP and exam
   consistent with volume depletion.  Other etiologies could be post-renal
   failure with history of BPH.  Trending down with IVFs.  No great
   derangements on UA.  Unclear baseline.
   - obtain [**Hospital1 966**] records to clarify Creatinine baseline
   - recheck after fluid resuscitation, if not normalizing, proceed with
   further work up.
   #. Anemia:   Hct drop to 31 from 45 on admission with unknown baseline,
   likely closer to baseline now given volume depletion and hypernatremia
   at presentation.   Normal bilirubin.
   - recheck p.m. hct
   #. Hypercalcemia: Patient with history of paget's disease.  Likely
   hypercalcemia exacerbated by dehydration.  Will follow with fluid
   resuscitation.
   #. CHF:  Has [**1-8**]+ MR on prior TTE.  Will hold metoprolol and lasix in
   the setting of infection.
   #.  Hypothyroidism: cont synthroid
   #.  Hx of Stroke: cont ASA 81mg, could discuss increasing dose with
   PCP.
   #.  Schizoaffective disorder:  on Wellbutrin, zyprexa, and remeron as
   outpatient.  Will hold in the setting of altered mental status.
   #. FEN: replete lytes prn, will need S/S study, but will give pureed
   diet for now.
   #. PPX: Sc heparin, fall precautions, bowel regimen prn, PPI blocker
   with hx of GERD
   #. ACCESS: RIJ
   #. CODE STATUS: DNR but okay to intubate, family prefers to avoid
   aggressive/invasive procedures if possible and prioritize reducing
   patient
s discomfort.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80-year-old male with a history of CVA (cerebrovascular accident), who presents with pneumonia and sepsis physiology along with significant hypernatremia. The patient's condition is as follows:

1. Sepsis: The most likely etiology is from pneumonia seen on chest X-ray. The patient has leukocytosis with a neutrophilic predominance on differential. He was given antibiotics in the emergency department and continued on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam in the MICU.

- Recheck CV O2 sat
- Continue NS boluses as needed for intravascular volume expansion with the goal MAP > 65
- Continue vanc/zosyn given the risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia
- Follow-up blood and urine cultures

2. Hypernatremia: The etiology is unclear, but it is likely from poor PO intake with insensible losses. No history of gastrointestinal losses. It is necessary to consider central or DI (diabetes insipidus) or dysregulation of thirst centers.

- Correct sodium at 1/2 mEq per hour with D5W at 150 cc/hr
- Trend chemistries tid
- Check urine osmoles
- Consider Duboff placement for free water boluses after discussion with the family

3. Renal failure: Most likely from pre-renal causes"
