","The patient is a 23-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for liver transplant evaluation due to a suspected Tylenol overdose. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues.

Firstly, the patient is experiencing a fever, with a recorded temperature of 101.2°F (38.4°C). This could indicate an infection, possibly pneumonia (PNA) or aspiration pneumonitis. The patient has been empirically treated with Clindamycin and further investigations such as a repeat chest X-ray and sputum culture are planned.

Secondly, the patient's elevated creatine kinase (CK) level suggests a possible Benadryl overdose, which is consistent with the reported trend in CK levels from 1278 to 822. Monitoring the CK levels is important to assess the severity and progression of the overdose.

Thirdly, the patient's history of a suicide attempt is noted, and his current mental state is described as stable with some suicidal ideation. A psychiatry consult and 1:1 sitter have been ordered for further management.

Additionally, the patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes (transaminases) and an increased international normalized ratio (INR), indicating possible liver dysfunction. The patient is being monitored closely, and hepatology and transplant recommendations are being sought.

Overall, the patient's main concerns include the potential for an infection such as PNA or aspiration pneumonitis, the ongoing effects of the suspected Tylenol and Ben"

   Assessment and Plan
   23M transfered from OSH for liver transplant evaluation in setting of
   tylenol overdose.
   # Tylenol overdose: Transaminases already trending down.  INR 1.1.  Per
   OSH records pt ingested 150 pills, and initial tylenol 8hrs out was
   364. Per tylenol nomogram, he is in the ""probable hepatic toxicity""
   range.  Pt was started on NAC w/in 8 hours and 16 hour continuous
   infusion of 100 mg/kg/hr was started at 10:00 am.
   - continue NAC
   - trend transaminases and INR q 6 hrs
   - appreciate hepatology/transplant recs
   .
   # Benadryl Overdose: Diphenhydramine has anticholinergic properties and
   thus is treated accordly.  Pt ingested 150 of tylenol PM which
   translates to 25 mg X 150 = 3.75g. Per toxicology recs at [**Hospital1 609**], if QRS >
   100 or R in VR > 3mm start bicarb infusion for pH goal between 7.45 and
   7.55.
   - check CK to r/o rhabdo
   - serial EKGs
   .
   # Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated for airway
   protection at OSH secondary to possible aspiration.  On arrival to the
   MICU, was awake and was able to complete an SBT at 50% and then was
   extubated.  CXR shows a possible RML/LL infiltrate and possible
   retro-cardiac opacity, likley from aspiration event.
   - will treat aspiration PNA w/ clindamycin
   - sputum culture if available.
   .
   # Suicide attempt: Psychiatry consult.
   - 1:1 sitter

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 23-year-old male who was transferred from another hospital for liver transplant evaluation due to a Tylenol overdose. He has been admitted to the ICU and has been started on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion for acetaminophen toxicity. The patient also ingested Benadryl, and his QRS complex on EKG is being monitored. 

The patient was intubated at the outside hospital for airway protection due to possible aspiration. Upon arrival in the MICU, he was able to complete a successful spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) at 50% and was subsequently extubated. A chest X-ray shows a possible right middle lobe/left lower lobe infiltrate and a retro-cardiac opacity, likely from aspiration. The patient has been started on clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia, and a sputum culture is pending.

The patient attempted suicide, and a psychiatry consultation has been requested. He requires close observation, and a 1:1 sitter has been assigned to him.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.2°F), heart rate of 128 bpm, blood pressure of 124/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. He is still on non-invasive ventilation support.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and potential impending liver failure due to a Tylenol overdose. He has been started on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for the overdose, but it was administered at a higher dose than recommended. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is still on mechanical ventilation but has been extubated successfully. His laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and troponin-T levels, indicating possible cardiac involvement. The patient has been diagnosed with liver function abnormalities, potential benzodiazepine intoxication, and aspiration pneumonia. He is also at risk for suicidal thoughts and requires a psychiatric consultation. The patient's medical team has decided to discontinue NAC and transfer him to the floor with a psych consult.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate remains elevated, and he may continue to struggle with adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Liver failure: Elevated liver enzymes suggest ongoing liver damage from the Tylenol overdose. If not managed properly, this could lead to acute liver failure.
3. Cardiac complications: Elevated troponin-T levels indicate potential cardiac involvement. This could suggest myocardial injury or stress"

","Summary:
The patient is a 23-year-old male admitted to the ICU for liver transplant evaluation due to a Tylenol overdose. He is currently experiencing fever, chest tightness while breathing, and anxiety. The patient has been treated with Ativan and Tylenol, but his fever persists. His vital signs show an elevated temperature, increased heart rate, and normal blood pressure. He is on mechanical ventilation with an oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and his extremities are warm and well perfused. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, suggesting an infection. Imaging shows an underpenetrated chest X-ray with no significant changes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever, elevated white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein levels suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. The chest X-ray findings indicate pneumonia, which may be due to aspiration. Further investigation, such as sputum culture, is necessary to identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Liver damage: The patient's initial presentation was related to a Tylenol overdose, which can lead to liver damage. Although his transaminase levels are decreasing, close monitoring of liver function is essential to detect any potential complications or deterioration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia due to aspiration. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and anxiety. Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 39.2°C (102.6°F), current temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 105-145 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 20-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, antianxiety medication, and proton pump inhibitors. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,942 mL and output of 3,440 mL, with a total balance of 1,502 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been monitored for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be crucial in preventing and treating VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU setting can increase the risk of DVT formation. Prophylactic measures such as compression"

Potential medical complications that can arise:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and right-sided rhonchi on lung auscultation suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia is a specific type of pneumonia that can occur when foreign material, such as vomit or gastric contents, is inhaled into the lungs. It is commonly associated with risk factors like altered mental status or impaired swallowing reflex.
2. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal bilir"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of Tylenol overdose and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of fever, tachycardia, and chest rales. Vital signs include a temperature of 102.6°F, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, lorazepam, and clindamycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's high fevers and chest rales indicate possible pneumonia, which may worsen if not properly treated.
2. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) suggest liver dysfunction, which could be a result of Tylenol overdose or underlying liver disease.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is below normal, indicating hypotension, which may require further investigation and management.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and sinus tachycardia may suggest delirium, which should be monitored closely for changes in cognitive function.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and risk factors such as older age increase the likelihood of DVT development. Prophylaxis with boots is recommended, but close monitoring for signs of"
