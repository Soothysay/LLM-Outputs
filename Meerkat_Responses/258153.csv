","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-nourished individual who presented with respiratory distress and was admitted to the ICU. They have a history of fever, increasing oxygen requirements, and bilateral fluid overload with collapse of the right middle lobe (RML) and right lower lobe (RLL). The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation with FiO2 of 100%, PSV of 8, and PEEP of 5. Their vital signs show tachycardia with a temperature of 39.3°C (102.7°F), blood pressure ranging from 116/72 to 127/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a fluid balance of -566 mL. The patient's ABG results are within normal limits, and they have an elevated white blood cell count of 7.2 K/uL. Lab results show elevated creatinine levels and slightly low potassium levels. Imaging reveals pulmonary edema with collapse of the RML and RLL. The microbiology results from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are negative for microorganisms. The patient is receiving ICU care, including pain management, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with Factor V Leiden deficiency who developed progressive hypoxemia after undergoing partial nephrectomy. The hypoxemia was initially attributed to mucus plugging, which improved following bronchoscopy. However, the patient now presents with bilateral fluid overload and collapse of the right middle lobe (RML) and right lower lobe (RLL) on chest X-ray. There is no evidence of infection, as Gram stain of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is negative for organisms and the patient does not have leukocytosis. The patient's fevers are likely due to post-surgical trauma from a large incision. He is currently on non-invasive ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 and has improved oxygen saturation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient initially experienced severe hypoxemia due to mucus plugging. Although this has improved post-bronchoscopy, there is still a risk of recurrence if the patient's airways remain obstructed.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient's chest X-ray shows signs of bilateral fluid overload, indicating potential heart failure without a pre-existing cardiac history. This can lead to respiratory distress and further deterioration in oxygenation.

3. Pain Management: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which may hinder his ability to clear mucus effectively. Improving pain control is crucial to"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo M with Factor V leiden defiency developed progressive hypoxemia
   s/p partial nephrectomy secondary to mucus plugging which is now
   substantially improved s/p bronchoscopy.  Despite fevers, he has no
   other indication of infection, copious mucus likely secondary to
   decreased ability to clear in the setting of splinting from post-op
   pain. Now concerned for fluid overload given pulm edema on CXR in
   addition to RML/RLL collapse.
   # Hypoxia: Repeat bronchoscopy significant for increased PMNs without
   organisms, suspicious for hospital acquired PNA given his fever.
   Overall resiratory function improved with lasix. S/p bronchoscopy
   showing copious amounts of clear non-purulent mucus.  Echo normal.
   Patient on continued NIPPV overnight [**4-4**] @40% with occasional increase
   in FiO2 to 60%.
   - Continue NIPPV
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP
   - UOP ~50mL/hr, Lasix as needed
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs; mucolytic nebs
   - Follow CXR with clinical change
   # Fevers: Patient persistently febrile despite antibiotic therapy for
   supposed HAP.  No other clear source of infection related.  No evidence
   of DVT, UTI, atelectasis is directly addressed with PPV.  Does have a
   large incision post-op but is only now in the window for wound
   infection (which does not appear to be infected).
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP
   - Trend WBC
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Patient
s Cr improving toward
   baseline of 1.3 with sufficient UOP and good response to lasix. Urology
   has advised us to expect ATN due to intraoperative ureteral clamping.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of Factor V Leiden deficiency who developed progressive hypoxemia after a partial nephrectomy. The hypoxemia was initially attributed to mucus plugging, but subsequent bronchoscopy showed increased polymorphonuclear leukocytes without organisms, raising suspicion for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's respiratory function improved with the administration of lasix. An echocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. The patient continues to experience fevers despite antibiotic therapy for HAP, and there is no clear source of infection. There are no signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's creatinine level is improving, indicating a positive response to lasix and expectation of acute on chronic renal failure due to intraoperative ureteral clamping. Coumadin has been restarted with an INR goal of 2.0-2.2 as advised by the outpatient hematologist. The patient remains on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and will continue to be monitored closely. Potential complications include worsening respiratory status, fluid overload, and further deterioration of renal function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with Factor V Leiden deficiency who developed progressive hypoxemia after a partial nephrectomy due to mucus plugging. He has been treated with bronchoscopy and Lasix, which improved his respiratory function. However, he remains febrile and shows signs of fluid overload with pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there are increased polymorphonuclear leukocytes seen on bronchoscopy without any microorganisms. The patient is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), Vanc/Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), Lasix for fluid overload, and other medications as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory function is still compromised, as evidenced by the need for NIPPV and occasional increases in FiO2. Continued monitoring and management of oxygenation is necessary.
2. Fevers: Despite antibiotic therapy for HAP, the patient persists with fevers. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection, and adjustment of the antibiotic regimen may be required.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's pulmonary edema on CXR indicates fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid balance and continued use of Lasix to promote diuresis are recommended.
4. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia: The presence of increased PMNs without organisms on bronchoscopy raises suspicion for hospital-ac"

The patient is currently being treated with a face tent, Vanc/Zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), Lasix as needed, albuterol/ipratropium nebs, and Flagyl for possible gut translocation. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis and an elevated creatinine level, indicating acute on chronic renal failure. His INR is also elevated, and he is currently on Coumadin for Factor V Leiden deficiency. The patient is experiencing post-operative pain and reports tenesmus, which will be discussed with urology. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen and has tachypnea. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation.

2. Fevers and Leukocytosis: The patient's persistent fevers despite antibiotic therapy suggest an ongoing infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and consider other potential causes, such as gut translocation.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening creatinine level indicates a decline in renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and fluid balance is required to manage fluid"

   cover any other anerobes not successfully covered by Zosyn.  No other
   clear source of infection related.  No evidence of DVT, UTI. Does have
   a wound post-op but no evidence of wound infection.  High concern for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with Factor V Leiden deficiency who underwent a partial nephrectomy. He has been experiencing hypoxia and fevers refractory to antipyretics. His current vital signs show a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 127/82 to 135/98 mmHg, heart rate between 95-124 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fevers. The patient is ambulatory and able to sit up on four limbs.

The patient has a history of allergies to cefazolin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). He has received doses of these antibiotics on different occasions. His current infusions include other ICU medications and unspecified other medications.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count compared to previous measurements. His creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.4. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, glucose, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen and has tachypnea. He remains on a face tent and was ambulatory yesterday."

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo M with Factor V leiden deficiency with hypoxia s/p partial
   nephrectomy.  He had a difficult night with fevers refractory to
   antipyrretics and continued hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Patient with continued oxygen requirement and tachypnea to
   high 20s overnight.  He continues to do well on face tent and was
   ambulatory yesterday.  Underlying process remains PNA vs. post-surgical
   inflammatory changes.  Fluid overload less likely contributing to his
   overall picture
   - Continue face tent, titrating to O2 sats >95%
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP will continue for total of 5d course
   - UOP ~50mL/hr, Lasix as needed
   - Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs
   - Follow CXR with clinical change
   # Cdiff
 on po Vanco, avoiding flagyl from interaction with coumadin,
   diarrhea improving
   # Fevers & leukocytosis: Patient persistently febrile despite
   antibiotic therapy for supposed HAP.  Flagyl was added overnight to
   cover any other anerobes not successfully covered by Zosyn.  No other
   clear source of infection related.  No evidence of DVT, UTI. Does have
   a wound post-op but no evidence of wound infection.  High concern for
   gut translocation.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP
   - Added Flagyl 500mg PO Q8H
   - Trend WBC
   # Factor V leiden: Coumadin restarted at 2.5mg daily with INR goal of
   2.0-2.2 as per his outpt hematologist. However, the patient is
   currently at 3.7.  Although flagyl can interact with Warfarin, the
   timing is too acute to be related.
   - Hold Warfarin today, reverse with signs of bleeding
   - Hematology follow up
   - no further vitamin K today (now down to 2.8)
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Patient
s Cr worsening slightly to
   1.4 with sufficient UOP and good response to lasix. Urology has advised
   us to expect ATN due to intraoperative ureteral clamping.
   - Trend Cr
   - Fluid/lasix to maintain UOP
   # Post Op Pain Mgt: Patient report tenesmus, will discuss bowel
   function with urology.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with Factor V Leiden deficiency who underwent a partial nephrectomy. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia and refractory fevers. The patient's recent events include four episodes of diarrhea, mild pain at the incision site, and an increase in INR. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/82 mmHg to 135/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is normal sinus rhythm. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated platelet count, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing hypoxia, likely due to pneumonia versus post-surgical inflammatory changes. He continues to receive supplemental oxygen and antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia. Fluid overload is considered less likely. 

The patient also has Clostridium difficile infection, for which he is being treated with vancomycin. Diarrhea has been improving, and the patient is avoiding Flagyl due to an interaction with Coumadin"
