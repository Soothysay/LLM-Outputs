   A 37 yo man with history of severe alcoholism with several ICU
   admissions for management of alchohol withdrawl in the past, HCV, and
   HBV, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for alcohol withdrawal.
   # Alcohol withdrawal: Based on history and exam, epsiode of
   hypertension and tachycardia in [**Name (NI) **], pt likely experienced alcohol
   withdrawal. He has already received aggressive benzodiazapine therapy
   in the ED. Will need close monitoring for further withdrawal treatment.

   # Hypernatremia: Now resolved. In setting of EtOH abuse and probable
   poor PO intake, suspect related to dehydration. Pt currently drinking

   provide gentle IV hydration as needed.
   # Peripheral neuropathy: Attributed in the past to EtOH abuse. Recent
   folate and B12 within normal limits. No hx of diabetes. Will control
   pain with analgesics for now; consider more definitive therapy when
   acute issues resolved.
   # Anemia: HCT at baseline. Likely multifactorial in etiology (Fe
   deficiency noted on recent studies, EtOH abuse, AOCD). Will empirically
   treat with Fe while in-house, although long-term additional work-up may
   be indicated.
   # HCV/HBV: Previous hx transaminitis, although this may be secondary to
   EtOH.
   -continue to trend liver enzymes
   # Depression/anxiety: No current treatment for this. SW involved; pt
   will need further psychiatric treatment going forward.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old man with a history of severe alcoholism, who was admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal. He has been treated with aggressive benzodiazepine therapy and is being closely monitored for further withdrawal treatment. The patient also has several medical conditions including hand pain, hypernatremia, peripheral neuropathy, anemia, HCV/HBV infection, and depression/anxiety. His vital signs are stable, and he is currently drinking to thirst. The patient will receive gentle IV hydration as needed and will be provided with pain medication for his hand pain. Further diagnostic tests and treatment plans are being implemented for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient has a history of severe alcoholism and was admitted for alcohol withdrawal. Close monitoring is required to prevent complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, or autonomic instability.
2. Finger fracture: Although the x-ray results are inconclusive, the patient has moderate swelling and erythema over his right hand digits. Orthopedic consultation should be considered to evaluate the need for splinting or casting.
3. Dehydration: The patient's history of EtOH abuse and poor PO intake may contribute to dehydration, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances and hypovolemia.
4. Peripheral neuropathy: The patient has a history of peripheral neuropathy attributed to EtOH abuse. Pain management and consideration of more definitive therapy should be discussed once acute"

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
 H/O ALCOHOL ABUSE
   37 yr old man with recurrent admission for etoh abuse and withdrawl
   presents with same
   1.       Alcohol Withdrawl: Initially needed aggressive benzodiazepines
   in ED for early withdrawl. CIWA now at 10, but tremors not necessarily
   all due to withdrawal. Right hand pain is confounding picture. Will
   change CIWA to q2h. In past has been important to use objective vitals
   as opposed to subjective reports. MVI, thiamine, folate.  IV hydration
   if not keeping up with po intake
   2.       Hand fracture: will ask +/- consult Ortho for reccs re
   splinting. Pain control prn
   3.       Social work: appreciate their help
   - plan is for Section 35 detox on [**Name (NI) 570**]
 pt is requesting to be
   sectioned so this is partly voluntary. Will need 1:1.
   4. Psych meds
 add back prozac, trileptal

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal, who presents with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including tremors. He also has a suspected right first digit fracture. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 136/72 mmHg, heart rate of 61 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient has received IV hydration and medications for alcohol withdrawal, including Valium and Percocet as needed. He has been prescribed folate, MVI, and thiamine supplementation. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. The patient's physical examination reveals tenderness in the ant chest and absent pulses in the right first three digits. The patient is currently being considered for section 35 detoxification and will require one-on-one monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium tremens (DTs): Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal symptoms, there is a risk of developing DTs, which is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and autonomic instability.
2. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to alcohol abuse puts him at an increased risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
3. Fracture complications:"

   -Appreciate Psych and SW input; plan for section 35 on Monday for
   transfer to detox
   # Hand pain: Evaluated by Hand with no need for splinting.
   -Elevate hand
   -Pain ctrl with percocet: will not uptitrate
   # Hypernatremia: In setting of EtOH abuse and probable poor PO intake,
   suspect related to dehydration. Had resolved on yestserday
s lab.
   Continue to encourage po intake.
   # Peripheral neuropathy: Attributed in the past to EtOH abuse. Recent
   folate and B12 within normal limits. No hx of diabetes. Will control
   pain with percocet, lidoderm, naproxen (pt refusing) prn; will not
   uptitrate per yesterday
s agreement with pt.
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline on prior labs. Likely multifactorial in
   etiology (Fe deficiency noted on recent studies, EtOH abuse, AOCD).
   Will empirically treat with Fe while in-house, although long-term
   additional work-up may be indicated.
   # HCV/HBV: Previous hx transaminitis, although this may be secondary to
   EtOH.
   # Depression/anxiety: No current treatment for this. SW involved; pt
   will need further psychiatric treatment going forward.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old man with a history of severe alcoholism, several ICU admissions for alcohol withdrawal management, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B. He was admitted to the hospital for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient has been receiving aggressive benzodiazepine therapy, which has not shown any objective evidence of ongoing withdrawal. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/61 to 144/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is alert and oriented, but agitated. He has moderate swelling over the 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits of his right hand with mild tenderness. No labs are available today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. EtOH withdrawal: The patient has a history of severe alcoholism and was admitted for alcohol withdrawal. Although he has been receiving benzodiazepine therapy, there is a potential for complications associated with alcohol withdrawal such as seizures or delirium tremens.

2. Infection: The patient's history of alcohol abuse puts him at a higher risk for infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and skin infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection is important.

3. Liver disease: The patient has a history of hepatitis C and hepatitis B. Chronic alcohol abuse can worsen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of recurrent admissions for alcohol abuse and withdrawal. He presents with the same symptoms and is experiencing alcohol withdrawal. The patient's right hand pain is a confounding factor, and past history suggests the importance of using objective vital signs rather than subjective reports.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient initially required aggressive benzodiazepines in the emergency department for early withdrawal. It is important to monitor and manage his symptoms closely, as withdrawal can lead to severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens.
2. Hand Fracture: The patient's right hand pain suggests a potential hand fracture. It would be necessary to consult with an orthopedic specialist for recommendations regarding splinting and pain control.
3. Malnutrition: Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, he may be at risk for malnutrition. Ensuring adequate nutrition is crucial for his overall health and recovery.
4. Thiamine Deficiency: Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to thiamine deficiency, which can result in Wernicke's encephalopathy if not treated promptly. Administering MVI (multivitamins) and thiamine is essential to prevent this complication.
5. Infection: Prolonged IV lines and hospital stays increase the risk of bloodstream infections. Regular monitoring of vital signs and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered.

   A 37 yo man with history of severe alcoholism with several ICU
   admissions for management of alchohol withdrawl in the past, HCV, and
   HBV, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for alcohol withdrawal.
   # Alcohol withdrawal: Pt admitted for EtOH withdrawal based on history
   and exam. Has been receiving aggressive benzodiazapine therapy with no
   objective evidence of ongoing withdrawal given agitation per agreement
   with pt given his desire to be sectioned for detox on Monday.
   -Cont folate, thiamine, MVI
   -Valium 10-20mg q2h per current regimen: will not uptitrate
   -Appreciate Psych and SW input; plan for section 35 on Monday for
   transfer to detox
   # Hand pain: Evaluated by Hand with no need for splinting.
   -Elevate hand
   -Pain ctrl with percocet: will not uptitrate
   # Hypernatremia: In setting of EtOH abuse and probable poor PO intake,
   suspect related to dehydration. Had resolved on yestserday
s lab.
   Continue to encourage po intake.
   # Peripheral neuropathy: Attributed in the past to EtOH abuse. Recent
   folate and B12 within normal limits. No hx of diabetes. Will control
   pain with percocet, lidoderm, naproxen (pt refusing) prn; will not
   uptitrate per yesterday
s agreement with pt.
   # Anemia: Hct at baseline on prior labs. Likely multifactorial in
   etiology (Fe deficiency noted on recent studies, EtOH abuse, AOCD).
   Will empirically treat with Fe while in-house, although long-term
   additional work-up may be indicated.
   # HCV/HBV: Previous hx transaminitis, although this may be secondary to
   EtOH.
   # Depression/anxiety: No current treatment for this. SW involved; pt
   will need further psychiatric treatment going forward.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old man with a history of severe alcoholism and multiple ICU admissions for alcohol withdrawal. He was admitted for alcohol withdrawal and has been evaluated for various conditions including hand pain, peripheral neuropathy, anemia, and depression/anxiety.

The patient is currently on CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) for alcohol withdrawal management and has not required benzodiazepine therapy overnight. Psych and social work have begun the process for Section 35 rehab/detox, but the patient is now willing to enter rehab voluntarily. The patient is competent to leave against medical advice if he changes his mind before the Section 35 is complete.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/60 to 125/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. He has mild swelling and tenderness in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits of his right hand, which is attributed to peripheral neuropathy due to ethanol abuse. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. However, his liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are elevated, and his bilirubin level is slightly above the normal range. Imaging and microbiology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with severe alcoholism admitted to the ICU for ethanol (etoh) withdrawal. The patient has a history of recurrent admissions for withdrawal and is currently experiencing symptoms of withdrawal, including agitation and tremors. The patient also has hand pain and chest wall pain, which may be related to a fight prior to admission. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is receiving aggressive benzodiazepines for pain management and to control withdrawal symptoms. The patient is also on multivitamins, thiamine, and folate supplementation. The plan is to initiate section 35 detoxification and restart psych medications such as Prozac and Trileptal. The patient is competent to leave against medical advice (AMA) and has been informed of the risks involved.

Potential medical complications:
1. Delirium tremens (DTs): This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur in individuals with a history of chronic alcohol abuse. It is characterized by sudden and severe mental or neurological changes, including confusion, agitation, hallucinations, fever, and rapid heartbeat.
2. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can also lead to seizures, which can range from minor tremors to generalized convulsions.
3. Infections: Alcohol abuse can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Chronic alcohol abuse can cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract, increasing the risk"
