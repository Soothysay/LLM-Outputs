","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted with severe sepsis, possibly due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), or aspiration. The patient has altered mental status, renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type II. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include tachycardia, hypotension, and fever. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, blood glucose, and potassium levels. Imaging reveals old strokes and migratory radio opaque nodules on chest X-ray. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of sepsis, altered mental status, chronic renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to chronic illnesses such as diabetes and renal failure, making her more susceptible to infections. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and even death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's kidneys are already compromised due to chronic kidney disease, and sepsis can further impair renal function. Close monitoring of kidney function and appropriate dialysis management are crucial.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is declining, which may be exacerbated by sepsis,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presents with fever, hypoxia, hypotension, and leukocytosis. She is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation due to severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. She also has chronic renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, including fever, hypoxia, hypotension, and leukocytosis, suggest sepsis. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection, and appropriate antibiotics should be administered.

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 347**]; his note and the ICU
   team note from today reflect my input.  I would add/emphasize that this
   43 y/o woman with DM1, ESRD on HD, and CVA with significant disability
   now presents with encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and shock.   BP
   has improved with treatment and now being trialed off of levophed.
   Exam notable for somnolence, heart with murmurs, and soft abdomen.
   Thyroid seems large.  Groin CVL site clean.  Right arm AV fistula.
   Cold in feet.  Scant palpable pulse on left arm.  CXR with basilar
   opacities as well as speckled radiodense material (?previously
   aspirated contrast)
   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o woman with DM1, ESRD on HD, and CVA with significant disability
   now presents with encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and shock.
   Septic shock
   Improved BP on therapy
   Seems likely to be pneumonia based on CXR and resp failure.  Check
   cultures.  Add atypical coverage to vanco/zosyn.
   Place arterial line.  If unable to place radial, and still requiring
   vasopressors, consider femoral or axillary.
   Resite CVL in next day or two (placed cleanly, but in femoral)
   Given DM1, large thyroid, would check TFTs and cortisol since PGAS 2 in
   ddx.
   Respiratory Failure
   Goal Vt in 6
 8 cc/kg range.  Check ABG.
   Leave intubated while shock state and encephalopathy predominate
   Encephalopathy
   Awaiting MRI, though suspect this is likely metabolic/sepsis-related

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with significant disability. She presents with encephalopathy, respiratory failure, and shock. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Oxygenation has improved, likely due to aspiration pneumonia. She will continue receiving vancomycin and zosyn, awaiting culture results.
- Sepsis with organ dysfunction: Secondary to pneumonia/aspiration. Repeat urine studies will be done to check for an alternate source of infection. Levophed weaning is being attempted, and if unsuccessful, an inferior vena cava (IVC) line will be placed to assess central venous pressure (CVP) and evaluate fluid status.
- Chronic renal failure (CRF): Renal consult for renal replacement therapy (RRT).
- Altered mental status: Improved responsiveness today, possibly due to hypoxia and hypotension. Further history from the hospital will be obtained regarding the reported subacute decline in mental status, which may be due to an alternate etiology. Neuro exam monitoring will continue, and a brain MRI is pending.
- Type II diabetes mellitus (DM): Lantus plus sliding scale insulin will be continued.
- History of CVA: ASA allergy clarification and restart"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and altered mental status for about one week. She presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure after a suspected aspiration event in the hospital. She was intubated and required vasopressors for post-intubation hypotension.

The patient has been receiving fluids and has shown improvement in oxygenation. She is currently on invasive ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. Her SpO2 is at 100%.

Her physical examination reveals that she has bilateral edema in her lower extremities and a necrotic area on her left heel. Neurologically, she is unresponsive and does not follow simple commands. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal kidney function.

Imaging studies show left midlung zone opacities on chest X-ray and chronic small vessel ischemic changes and prior lacunar infarcts on head CT. An MRI is recommended for further evaluation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Aspiration pneumonia is suspected as the likely cause. Vanco and Zosyn will be continued, awaiting culture results.
2. Sepsis, Severe (with organ dysfunction): Secondary to pneumonia/aspiration. Repeat urine studies for alternate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with sepsis from an unknown source, possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), or aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and the source of infection is unclear. This can lead to further deterioration in her condition and potential organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may progress to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) if not managed properly.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury (AKI).
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is likely exacerbated by sepsis, and it is important to identify the underlying cause of her altered mental status, such as infection, metabolic imbalances, or medication effects.
5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient has pressure ulcers on her heels and coccyx, which can worsen if not properly managed.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient is still"

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presents with sepsis from an unknown source. She has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. The source of sepsis is unclear, with possibilities including hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), or aspiration.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She is also receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure. Blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci in clusters, which may indicate a Staphylococcus species infection.

She has chronic renal failure and is undergoing hemodialysis at [location]. Her electrolytes are relatively stable, but she is hyperkalemic. Her diabetes is poorly controlled, and she is currently taking insulin.

The patient has a history of hypertension and a previous cerebrovascular accident with residual right-sided hemiparesis. She also has pressure ulcers on both heels and the coccyx due to her bed-bound state. The family is dissatisfied with her care at the current hospital.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. Further investigations are needed to determine the exact source of infection and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy. The patient requires continued respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an intubated individual with a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit. They have been diagnosed with severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient is receiving various treatments including antibiotics, IV fluids, and medications for glycemic control. They have multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line and multi-lumen line. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they require frequent IV fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure. They are hypernatremic and receiving infusions of both free water and D5W. The patient's recent blood culture showed growth of Gram-positive cocci in clusters, which is already being treated with vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and at risk for developing VAP, a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVTs.
3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and the use of corticosteroids can predispose the patient to stress ulcers.
4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive lines increase the risk of nosocomial infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Renal function deterioration: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to"

   #  Altered mental status:  son reports recently declining mental status
   for 3 months with an acute decline per nurse in the past few days
   culminating in today's event.  Per nurse, patient has been quite
   depressed, raising the question of ingestion (? related to CXR
   findings), but tox screen here is negative.  Current mental status is
   likely exacerbated by sepsis. Mental status stable.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status, sepsis, and aspiration pneumonia. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. The patient's vital signs show a fever, elevated heart rate, and normal blood pressure. They have right lower extremity edema but no other significant abnormalities on physical examination. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and presence of pneumonia suggest ongoing sepsis. This is a critical condition that requires prompt treatment to prevent further deterioration.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is declining, and there is a concern for a new stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA). An MRI is planned to evaluate this further. The patient's airway must be protected, and appropriate neurological monitoring should be implemented.

4. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, and a Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test is pending. Empiric vancomycin and metronidazole therapy has been started. It is important to monitor for signs of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and"

   Respiratory failure: will review CXR this am, will send sputum culture,
   Will switch to pressure support
   Altered mental status: appearantly declining over the course of the
   recent few weeks, was acutely worsening, attempting to obtain MRI to
   evaluate for new stroke/CVA, a little improved today compared with
   admission. Will hold off on LP for now and obtain MRI first.
   Diarrhea: C.diff pending. Will start on empiric vanco po and iv flagyl
   given rising white count
   Renal failure: on HD TTS, due to HD in am through fistula, no need for
   urgent HD
   DM II: glucose in good range
   Decubitus ulcer/vascular ulcers: continue wound care.
   Hypernatremia: contineu D5W and free water boluses
   Hct drop: guiac negative this am. hct drop 8 points, now stable, will
   follow up hct, will follow up retic count and smear, DIC work up

   I saw and examined the pt on rounds, and was physically present with
   ICU team for the key portions of services provided. I agree with Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 10164**]
s note above, including assessment and plan. I would add:
   43 yo [**Hospital3 240**] resident with ESRD, s/p CVA admitted with acute
   respiratory failure and sepsis. Overnight, has stayed off pressors but
   intermittently hypotensive requiring fluid resuscitation- arterial line
   placed. Intermittently opens eyes to voice. Microbiology reveals [**1-13**]
   GPC bacteremia, species pending.
   Sepsis/GPC bacteremia, remains on Vanc/zosyn but with worsening
   leukocytosis, need to be concerned abt persistent bacteremia or a
   second infection (lungs, stool). Obtain surveillance blood cultures,
   add empiric C diff coverage while waiting for stool studies to return.
   Acute respiratory failure: poor MS and high RSBI preclude extubation
   today. On PSV- continue daily SBT.
   AMS is unchanged to slightly better. Unable to get MRI yesterday for
   logistical reasons, will reattempt today. LP could be considered if she
   fails to improve, though the stronger suspicion is for non-CNS
   infection aggravating baseline  poor mental status.
   Decreased hct more likely due to renal insufficiency with poor
   production, in the absence of obvious blood loss, but will re-check
   this afternoon.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 45 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with acute respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient has been critically ill and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to poor mental status (AMS) and high respiratory support burden index (RSBI).

The patient's current medical conditions include septic shock, respiratory failure, altered mental status, diarrhea (C. difficile pending), renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypernatremia. The patient also has decubitus ulcers and a suspected hct drop related to renal failure and marrow suppression.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 102/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and elevated glucose levels.

The patient's imaging reveals no significant findings on chest X-ray, and microbiology results show a GPC bacteremia. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, heparin, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include persistent bacteremia or a second infection, worsening of respiratory failure, worsening of AMS, development of C. difficile infection, progression of renal failure, and worsening"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease, type II diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She presents with sepsis from an unknown source, possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia or urinary tract infection, along with respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and chronic renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. She has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for diabetes management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. It is crucial to continue aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care to prevent further deterioration.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute but not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Maintaining ventilatory support and gradually weaning off the ventilator may be necessary.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has pressure ulcers on her heels and coccyx. Conserving management and regular dressing changes are essential to prevent further damage.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and undergoes hemodialysis three times a week. Close monitoring of renal function and adjusting the dialysis regimen accordingly are important.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple ongoing medical complications. 

1. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of MMV/PSV/AutoFlow. Their Vt (set) is 450 mL, PS is 10 cmH2O, RR (set) is 10, PEEP is 5 cmH2O, FiO2 is 40%, and SpO2 is 100%. These settings indicate the patient's respiratory function is being supported by the ventilator.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The note mentions that the skin has not been assessed, so it is unclear what specific issue or injury there may be.

3. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient has been cultured multiple times, indicating an ongoing infection. Sepsis is a systemic response to infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs show an increased heart rate (HR) and low blood pressure (BP), suggesting possible circulatory compromise.

4. Renal failure, chronic: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels (4.5, 5.2, 6.1, 6.5) and decreased hematocrit (Hct) levels (30.7, 23.5, 23.7, 22.7). Chronic renal failure is indicated by the consistently high creatinine levels and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presents with sepsis from an unknown source, possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia/hospital-acquired bacteremia (HCAP/HAP). The patient is intubated mostly for mental status improvement and currently on mandatory minute ventilation (MMV).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, primarily for mental status improvement. Continuous monitoring of arterial blood gas (ABG) should be done, and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with respiratory support should be considered for extubation. Code status verification is also important in case re-intubation is required.

2. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia with gram-positive cocci (GPC) and an unclear source, possibly a fistula for hemodialysis (HD). There is also a suspicion of HCAP/HAP.

   I saw and examined the pt, and was present with the ICU team for the
   key portions of services provided. I agree with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**]
s note,
   including assessment and plan. I would add:
   43 yo female s/p CVA, ESRD on HD,  admitted from [**Hospital1 238**] with respiratory
   failure, AMS, and shock. On Vanco/zosyn for CNS bacteremia, HCAP vs
   aspiration PNA. MRI also demonstrated acute lunar infarcts.
   Pt intubated on MMV, able to respond to directions, RSBI 48
   Her major problems include:
   For acute respiratory failure: Improved ventilatory mechanics, and
   mental status mildly improved. Will move to extubation
   For acute lunar infarct: pt on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] touch base. Regarding sepsis,
   pt on Vancomycin for CNS bacteremia though this may be a contaminant;
   also zosyn for empiric aspiration/HCAP coverage. If surveillance
   cultures negative x 48 hours would dc vanco. HD for ESRD as per renal.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 50 minutes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of vasculopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with acute agitation, hypoxemia, and hypertensive emergency requiring pressors. The patient is unresponsive and unable to provide a medical history. She has been intubated in the emergency department due to hypoxemia.

The patient's problems include altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypertensive emergency. She attempted an MRI with a new acute lacunar infarct. 

In the 24-hour period, the patient received various antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and Piperacillin. She also received heparin sodium for prophylaxis, nephrocaps, famotidine, and chlorhexidine.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4°C
- Heart rate: 101 bpm
- Blood pressure: 93/66 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation

The patient has diminished radial and dorsalis pedis pulses on the right side and diminished dorsalis pedis pulse on the left side. She is unable to stand. Neurologic examination reveals decreased movement and tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of vasculopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute agitation and hypoxemia. The patient was intubated in the emergency department and required vasopressor support for hypertension. There is minimal interaction with the head CT, indicating a possible new CVA. The patient's medical conditions include altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypertension.

24-Hour Events:
The patient attempted to be extubated but was unsuccessful. An MRI revealed a new acute lacunar infarct. The patient is unresponsive and unable to provide any history. Allergies to antibiotics include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and piperacillin.

Medications:
The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, nephrocaps, famotidine, and metronidazole. She is also on prophylactic antibiotics, specifically vancomycin with hemodialysis.

Flow Sheet Data:
The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/66 mmHg to 170/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight remains"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of vasculopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with acute agitation and hypoxemia, leading to intubation in the emergency department. The patient experienced hemodynamic instability requiring pressors and showed signs of increased oxygen demand. A head CT was performed but did not show any new findings related to a cerebrovascular event.

The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hemodynamic instability. The respiratory support involves mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 100. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.23, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 46 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

The physical examination revealed diminished peripheral pulses on both upper and lower extremities. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 101 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 93/66 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The blood glucose level is significantly elevated at 244 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate an elevated creatinine (Cr) level and low potassium (K+) level.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, famotidine, nephrocaps, risser, and various antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors, including a possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with suppressed respiratory drive and aspiration pneumonia. Weaning off mechanical ventilation and determining reintubation requirements will be necessary. Continued coverage for possible aspiration pneumonia with levofloxacin is also recommended.

2. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA): The new MRI findings suggest the presence of a CVA. Consultation with the neurology service is advised. Restarting aspirin (ASA) 81 mg and initiating a statin, along with aggrenox, may be necessary.

3. Hemodynamic instability (HoTN): The patient experienced hemodynamic instability requiring pressors. Blood cultures with gentamicin-resistant gram-positive cocci in clusters have been obtained. Continuous vancomycin coverage is recommended, and the goal is to determine the final culture"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and altered mental status. Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to increased secretions. Since then, multiple interventions have been performed, including obtaining blood cultures, starting intravenous fluids, administering antibiotics, and monitoring vital signs. The patient's vital signs remain stable with a heart rate in the 80s, blood pressure ranging from 76-132 mmHg, respiratory rate between 10-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 2,874 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count within normal range, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure indicates a critical condition. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to prolonged immobility and pressure from the endotracheal tube.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive blood cultures suggest a severe infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Renal Failure"

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with sepsis from an unknown source, possibly hospital-acquired pneumonia or healthcare-associated pneumonia. She is intubated for respiratory failure, primarily due to altered mental status. The patient has chronic kidney disease and undergoes hemodialysis at [**Location (un) 4465**] [**Location (un) 590**] on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. She is also diabetic and on insulin therapy.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of sepsis leading to septic shock, further deterioration of renal function, development of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemia, and potential complications related to her altered mental status."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, sepsis of unknown origin, and chronic renal failure. The patient has been intubated for mental status changes and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She also has a fistula for hemodialysis (HD). Her blood cultures show gram-positive cocci bacteremia, and she has been diagnosed with stage IV chronic kidney disease. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, and she has a history of previous CVA with right hemiparesis. She was on aspirin despite an allergy, so a consultation with neurology has been requested. The patient's diabetes is managed with insulin (lantus and humalog). Her blood pressure has been intermittently hypotensive, and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped. She is due for dialysis today. The patient's respiratory status is being monitored, and she will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with respiratory system compliance (RSBI) assessment for possible extubation. The source of sepsis is still unclear, possibly healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She has a stage 2 coccygeal ulcer and bilateral heel abrasions. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, and her electrolytes"

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with possible sepsis from an unknown source. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was reintubated due to increased secretions and intermittent apnea. ABGs are difficult to obtain, possibly related to neurologic issues or over-ventilation. The plan is to decrease TV to allow CO2 to run more near baseline, evaluate secretion management, and continue mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient had coag-negative staphylococcus in her first set of blood cultures and GNR in the CX dated [**1-31**]. Surveillance CXs have been negative to date. She is on levofloxacin and vancomycin. The plan includes daily blood cultures, calling the lab regarding the identity of GPR, and continuing vancomycin IV until speaking with the lab.

3. New stroke: Bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts were seen on the head MRI. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, and she has a history of CVA with right hemiparesis. She was on aspirin despite an apparent allergy. The plan is to switch her to Plavix, perform a TTE to rule out an embolic stroke, and follow up with neurology"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with possible sepsis from an unknown source. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been reintubated due to increased secretions and is currently on mechanical ventilation with intermittent apnea. This suggests the need for ongoing respiratory support and monitoring.
2. Sepsis: The patient is being treated with antibiotics (levofloxacin and vancomycin) for suspected sepsis. It is important to continue monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the antibiotic regimen as necessary.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infection. Regular skin assessment and appropriate skin care measures should be implemented.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and requires regular dialysis sessions. Adequate fluid balance management and monitoring of renal function parameters are essential.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. Close monitoring and neurological assessment should be performed to identify any potential"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with possible sepsis from an unknown source and a new stroke.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and hypertension.

The patient has been reintubated for increased secretions and is currently on mechanical ventilation (MMV) due to intermittent apnea. Secretions have improved today, but there is minimal gag reflex. The plan is to discuss with the patient's brother about the possibility of tracheostomy if extubation fails. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) was attempted this morning after hemodialysis (HD), but the patient was not successfully extubated. A venous blood gas (VBG) during SBT was also performed.

The patient's sepsis is being managed with vancomycin therapy, and daily blood cultures are being obtained. The laboratory is being called to discuss the speciation of the gram-positive rod (GPR) identified in the blood cultures.

A new stroke has been identified on the head MRI, which shows bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, and she has a history of CVA with right-sided hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), presenting with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may continue to deteriorate, leading to further respiratory distress or failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection may progress, potentially leading to septic shock and multi-organ failure.
3. New cerebrovascular accident (CVA): The patient's underlying vascular disease increases the risk of another stroke.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored to prevent hypoglycemia.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The risk of developing pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation is higher compared to those who are not ventilated.
7. Infection control: The patient is at risk of acquiring additional infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.
8. Tracheostomy: Depending on her ability to protect her airway, the patient may require a tracheostomy for long-term airway management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, sepsis, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and hypertension. The patient underwent reintubation due to increased secretions and intermittent apnea. She is being treated with vancomycin for sepsis, and her blood cultures are negative. The patient also has a new stroke with bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on head MRI. She has stage IV chronic kidney disease and requires hemodialysis. Her diabetes management includes frequent boluses of insulin and adjustments to her long-acting insulin dosage. The patient's hypertension is managed by holding certain medications while she experiences intermittent hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as elevating the head of bed, providing mouth care, and monitoring the respiratory system's infection risk index (RSBI).
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - Immobility and prolonged hospitalization can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as heparin sodium, should be administered to reduce the risk.
3. Stress ulcer -"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with respiratory failure, sepsis, stroke, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypoglycemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been reintubated due to increased secretions and intermittent apnea. There is a risk of further respiratory complications if extubation fails.
2. Sepsis: The patient is on vancomycin for an unknown source of infection. Continuous monitoring and management of sepsis are necessary to prevent its progression and associated complications.
3. Stroke: The patient has bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on head MRI. Close monitoring of neurological status is required to assess any changes or worsening of neurological symptoms.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient is undergoing hemodialysis three times a week. Management of CKD includes monitoring electrolyte levels, fluid balance, and adherence to dialysis treatments.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient requires frequent boluses to manage episodes of hypoglycemia. Monitoring blood glucose levels and adjusting insulin doses are crucial to prevent further hypoglycemic events.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, especially while holding certain medications. Adjustments in ant"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, which can lead to further respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. If left untreated or inadequately treated, sepsis can progress to septic shock and multiple organ failure.
3. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which increases the risk of complications related to kidney function such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased susceptibility to infections.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors such as hypoglycemia, sepsis, or medication effects. This can lead to difficulties in communication and decision-making.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had episodes of low blood sugar levels, which can cause neurological complications if not promptly addressed.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has a history of diabetes, which increases the risk of infections, poor wound healing, and cardiovascular complications.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to ensure the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who also has a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis. She failed extubation on February 3rd and has been re-intubated due to secretions. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. Her laboratory results show abnormalities in hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose levels, and other electrolyte imbalances. Imaging reveals clear lung fields with the endotracheal tube placed appropriately. Microbiology results from blood cultures show CNS and GPRs growth, but subsequent cultures are negative. The patient's plan includes re-attempts at extubation, considering a tracheostomy if necessary. She is also being treated for sepsis, a new CVA, ESRD, and hypoglycemia. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and she remains in the ICU."

s note, including assessment and plan. I would add: 42 yo
   female admitted from [**Hospital3 240**] with aspiration/acute respiratory
   failure, presumed sepsis, acute lacunar infarcts. s/p failed extubation
   [**2-3**] for secretions.
   Extubated again this afternoon with subsequent respiratory distress,
   stridor, upper airway congestionfor the next several hours, which is
   similar to what happened with her last attempted extubation. Think her
   failed extubations have been related to inability to adequately protect
   her airway- discussion with family this afternoon re: trach.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 45 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis. She failed extubation on February 3rd due to secretions. The patient has a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) from February 17th and is currently on Plavix and a statin. She also has ESRD, hypoglycemia, and a new CVA. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is receiving appropriate care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has already experienced failed extubation twice, indicating a high risk for respiratory distress and potential need for reintubation.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis appears to be resolving, there is still a risk of infection due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines.
3. New CVA: The patient's recent stroke increases her risk of neurological complications, such as increased intracranial pressure or hemorrhagic transformation.
4. ESRD: The patient's kidney failure requires ongoing hemodialysis, which carries its own set of complications, including infection at the vascular access site.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has labile sugars and requires close monitoring and management of her blood glucose levels to prevent hypoglycemic episodes.
6. Tracheostomy/PEG tube placement: Given the patient's inability to protect her airway, there is a possibility that she may require a tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis. She failed extubation on February 3rd. The patient has been intubated again due to secretions and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 290-340 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. Her respiratory system is clear, and her blood gases show a pH of 7.9, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, and PaO2 of 99 mEq/L. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/36 to 164/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and follows simple commands. Her abdominal examination is unremarkable, and she has no lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels. Imaging reveals clear lung parenchyma with the endotracheal tube 5.4 cm above the carina. Microbiology results from blood cultures on January 31st are pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who has also had a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in 2017. She presents with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis, which led to failed extubation on February 3rd. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

24-hour events: No significant events were noted by the RN staff, and there were no secretions observed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/36-61 mmHg to 164/64-81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, warm skin, and soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination shows the patient is sedated and follows simple commands, but movement and tone assessments could not be performed.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. Blood cultures from January 31st show CNS and GPRs growth, but repeat cultures are negative.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient was re-intubated"

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with possible sepsis from an unknown source and a new stroke. 

The patient's respiratory failure is due to increased secretions, leading to reintubation. She is currently on minimal ventilator support. There are concerns about her gag reflex. 

Sepsis is suspected, as evidenced by coag-negative staphylococci in the first set of blood cultures, followed by growth of Propionibacterium acnes (GPR) in the subsequent cultures. The patient is currently on vancomycin and awaiting the identification of the GPR. 

The patient has experienced a new stroke, with bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts seen on the head MRI. Her mental status is slowly improving, and she has a history of CVA with right hemiparesis. She was taking aspirin despite having an allergy to it. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no evidence of an embolic course. 

The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and undergoes hemodialysis at [location] on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. She is due for dialysis today. 

In terms of diabetes management, the patient has had episodes of hypoglycemia requiring frequent boluses. Her basal insulin dose has been decreased from"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, and hypoglycemia. The patient has been intubated multiple times and is currently on invasive ventilation. She has a tracheostomy planned and is expected to have one. Her blood cultures appear to be contaminants, so she has been taken off levofloxacin and vancomycin. The patient has a new stroke, as indicated by bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on her head MRI. Her mental status is slowly improving. She also has stage IV chronic kidney disease and requires hemodialysis. She experiences episodes of hypoglycemia and is being managed with insulin. The patient has hypertension and is on medications for it, but they are being held intermittently when she is hypotensive. She is receiving IV fluids with potassium and has an H2 blocker. Her access includes a peripheral IV line and a PICC line. She is also on heparin subcutaneously. The patient's code status is full, and she has a contact person, her brother, whom we need to talk to today. Her current disposition is to remain in the ICU.

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) presenting with possible sepsis from an unknown source and stroke. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient was reintubated due to increased secretions and intermittent apnea. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with minimal gag reflex. Her blood cultures show coag-negative staph initially, then GPR, while surveillance cultures have been negative. She is on vancomycin and awaiting identity of GPR.

The patient also has new bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on head MRI, indicating a new stroke. Her mental status is slowly improving, and she has a history of CVA with right hemiparesis. She was on aspirin despite having an allergy to it, and her TTE did not show any evidence of an embolic course. It is recommended to continue Plavix, follow up with neurology recommendations, and continue atorvastatin.

The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and undergoes hemodialysis at [location] on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. She is due for dialysis today.

Regarding her diabetes management, she has experienced episodes of hypoglycemia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and altered mental status. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, but was extubated as his oxygen saturation levels were stable at 70% on forced manual mask ventilation. However, he tends to tilt his head back and block the airway, along with not clearing secretions effectively.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, fentanyl for pain management, and other ICU medications. He has a known allergy to metformin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/66 mmHg to 180/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 923 mL and output of 1760 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 837 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a pressure support of 5 cmH2O, peak inspiratory pressure of 40 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 50, and an ABG result of pH 7.41, PaCO2 52, PaO2 73, and HCO3- 30 mEq/L.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic examination not assessed as well.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal kidney function tests with increased creatinine levels. Other lab results indicate imbalances in electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and chloride.

Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and immobility.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheterization.
3. Nosocomial infection due to impaired skin integrity and compromised immune system.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening of chronic renal failure due to fluid overload and sepsis.
5. Pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and impaired skin integrity.
6. Delirium or worsening of altered mental status due to sepsis, medication effects, or hypoglycemia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), recurrent respiratory failure due to secretions and poor mental status, and awaiting tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). 

The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. She has a history of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic renal failure (CRF). 

The patient has been admitted with severe sepsis and respiratory failure. She was reintubated after experiencing recurrent respiratory failure due to the inability to tolerate secretions and poor mental status. After discussing with the family, the decision was made to proceed with tracheostomy and PEG.

The patient is currently on minimal ventilator support and tolerating it well. She also has leukocytosis and positive blood cultures (BCX), indicating an infection. The antibiotics should be stopped, and a new set of cultures should be obtained. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Her creatinine (Cr) levels are high, indicating renal impairment. Other lab results include low TCO2, normal glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels (Na+, K+). 

The patient has impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), recurrent respiratory failure due to secretions and poor mental status, and type II diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is critically ill.

The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. She has been reintubated twice after recurrent respiratory failure due to the inability to tolerate secretions, absent gag reflex, and poor mental status. The decision has been made to proceed with tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) given the patient's condition.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with minimal support and awaiting tracheostomy placement. She also has leukocytosis and a positive blood culture, but the blood culture results may be contaminated. Antibiotics have been stopped, and the blood culture will be repeated.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Renal function tests indicate chronic renal failure. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, but there is a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, and further evaluation of free thyroxine (FT4) is recommended.

The patient is receiving tube feeds through a nasogastric tube, and glycemic control is well managed with regular insulin sliding"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), recurrent respiratory failure due to secretions and poor mental status, and awaiting tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. She has been reintubated and is currently on continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support ventilation (CPAP/PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 50, and her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 100%.

The patient has multiple medical complications including chronic renal failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, diabetes mellitus type II, altered mental status, and hypoglycemia. She also has impaired skin integrity and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.2, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Imaging studies reveal a chest X-ray showing bilateral infiltrates, which could indicate pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the attending physician has ruled out ARDS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, a recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and recurrent respiratory failure due to secretions and poor mental status. The patient is currently awaiting a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient's respiratory failure is unclear in etiology but likely related to the history of CVA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing recurrent respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of infection and other complications.
3. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic infection that may lead to further complications if not treated promptly.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may require ongoing management and could worsen if not adequately controlled.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which can make it challenging to assess and manage the patient's needs effectively.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had episodes of hypoglycemia, which can be dangerous and require careful monitoring and management.
7. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, which may contribute to various complications if not well-managed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presents with possible sepsis from an unknown source and a new stroke. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and requires a tracheostomy. Her mental status is improving, but she has a history of CVA with right hemiparesis and was on aspirin despite an allergy. She also has stage IV chronic kidney disease and undergoes hemodialysis three times a week as an outpatient. The patient experiences episodes of hypoglycemia requiring frequent boluses and has decreased her dose of lantus. She has hypertension and is currently on metoprolol and lisinopril, but these medications are being held intermittently due to hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 123/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. Her labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient is on multiple medications including fentanyl, lantus, humalog, levofloxacin, and vancomycin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
- She presents with possible sepsis from an unknown source and a new stroke.
- The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, and hypoglycemia.
- She requires reintubation due to poor airway posture and gag reflex, indicating the need for a tracheostomy.
- Her blood cultures appear to be contaminants, so antibiotics have been stopped.
- The patient's mental status is slowly improving, but she has a history of CVA with right-sided hemiparesis. She was on aspirin despite having an allergy to it. A TTE showed no evidence of an embolic course.
- She underwent hemodialysis at [**Location (un) 4465**] [**Location (un) 590**] T/Th/Sat as an outpatient.
- Her diabetes management involves frequent boluses of insulin, reducing Lantus dosage, and using Humalog.
- Her hypertension requires holding metoprolol and lisinopril while intermittently hypotensive.
- IV fluids with potassium and repletion of electrolytes as needed are being administered.
- Heparin SQ and a H2 blocker are"

","Summary:
The patient is intubated and admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. They have a history of chronic renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently receiving various medications including famotidine, heparin sodium, and fentanyl. They are also receiving nutrition through a feeding tube. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104-173 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological assessment is incomplete as they are not fully responsive and their movement, tone, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and elevated creatinine levels indicating possible kidney dysfunction. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.
4. Sepsis: The patient"

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II (DM), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source and a stroke. The patient's chief complaint is being intubated.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient's respiratory failure is due to failed extubation caused by profuse secretions, no gag reflex, and poor airway posture. She is currently intubated again and awaiting tracheostomy.

The possible sepsis on admission has resolved, but the patient still shows leukocytosis for unclear reasons. Her blood cultures appear to be contaminants, and she was previously on levofloxacin and vancomycin, which have been discontinued. The patient's blood pressure is stable, and antibiotics have been held while monitoring her clinical status closely.

The patient has a new stroke, with bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on head MRI. Her mental status is slowly improving, and she has a history of CVA with right hemiparesis. She was on aspirin despite an allergy, and clopidogrel was started per neurologic recommendations but was discontinued in preparation for tracheostomy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent severe cerebral vascular accident (CVA), and recurrent respiratory failure due to the inability to protect the airway, awaiting tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient has been stable for several days with good gas exchange.

The patient has leukocytosis, which remains without any evidence of infection. All cultures are negative. The antibiotic has been held for now and is being monitored. The timing of trach and peg will be discussed with the Intensivist (IP) today. Plavix has been held and aspirin (ASA) has been started in its place.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition is being managed through tube feeds. Glycemic control is well maintained. The patient has a PICC line in place for medication administration. Prophylactic measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, a stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently dispositioned to the ICU. The total time spent with the patient is 30 minutes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
   43F with ESRD on HD, recent severe CVA, recurrent resp failure due to
   inability to protect airway, awaiting trach and peg. She has been
   stable for several days with good gas exchange.
   Leukocytosis remains without any evidence of infection. All cultures
   negative. Holding antibiotic for now and monitoring.
   Will speak with IP today about the timing of trach and peg. Plavix has
   been held and ASA has been started in place.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source and a new stroke. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, but she has impaired skin integrity, renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and a history of DM type II.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient failed extubation due to profuse secretions, no gag reflex, and poor airway posture. She is currently intubated again and awaiting a tracheostomy.
2. New stroke: The patient has bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on head MRI, indicating a new stroke.
3. Persistent leukocytosis: The patient has persistently elevated white blood cell count despite antibiotic treatment for pneumonia. Possible sources include decubitus ulcers, Clostridium difficile infection, stress response, or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Possible sepsis: Although the patient's blood cultures appear to be contaminants, she initially presented with signs of severe sepsis. Close monitoring of her clinical status is necessary.
5. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and requires hemodialysis at [**Location (un) 4465**] [**Location (un) 590**] on T/Th/S"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal failure, and altered mental status. He presented to the ICU with respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and hypoglycemia. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a stage 2 coccygeal ulcer and bilateral heel abrasions. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/39 to 161/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,179 mL and output of 348 mL over the past 24 hours. His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including potassium, sodium, and chloride. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheter use increase the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), hypoglycemia, and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/39-161/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving propofol infusion and various other medications in the ICU. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies are pending. The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and potential medical complications may include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, septic shock, and uncontrolled blood glucose levels."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who also has a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in 2017. She presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis, which is now resolved. The patient has failed extubation twice due to poor gag reflex and excessive secretions, and she may require a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient had sepsis that has been resolved, with stable hemodynamics, no evidence of central nervous system or gastrointestinal infection based on blood cultures and clinical assessment. Antibiotics were stopped as there is no source of infection, and the patient will be monitored clinically.

The patient has been started on aspirin (ASA) and a statin, holding Plavix due to anticipated PEG/trach placement. The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis treatment. Wound care services are requested to evaluate the left heel and dependent sacral ulcer. There is leukocytosis, which will be monitored for signs of infection, and no empirical treatment is needed at this time. A Clostridium difficile test and urinalysis will be performed, along with blood and sputum cultures.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving Nutren Pulmonary (full) at a rate of 45 mL/hour, and her blood sugar levels are well controlled with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has a PICC line in place, and prophylaxis measures include subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prevention, and elevation of the head of bed (HOB), mouth care, and daily wake-up for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is in the ICU. The total time spent with the patient is 30 minutes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted with possible sepsis from an unknown source and a new stroke. The patient's respiratory failure led to failed extubation, so she is currently intubated again and awaiting a tracheostomy. Her mental status has been improving slowly. She has a history of CVA with right-sided hemiparesis and was on aspirin despite an allergy, but it was discontinued in preparation for the tracheostomy. Clopidogrel was started per neurologic recommendations but is now being held. The patient also has persistent leukocytosis, which could be due to postoperative pneumonia (PNA) or stress response. Possible sources include decubitus ulcers or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Blood cultures appear to be contaminants, and antibiotics have been discontinued. The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and undergoes hemodialysis (HD) at home. She has had recent episodes of hypoglycemia, but her insulin regimen has been adjusted. The patient's blood pressure was hypertensive overnight, so metoprolol has been restarted and lisinopril has been held. Her current medications include propofol for sedation, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and an H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis. She has"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source and a new stroke.

The patient experienced respiratory failure and was initially intubated due to profuse secretions, lack of gag reflex, and poor airway posture. She is now awaiting tracheostomy.

She also has impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), and hypoglycemia.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and normal oxygen saturation. Her blood cultures were taken from the dialysis catheter, and she has been on various antibiotics, including vancomycin and levofloxacin, which have been discontinued.

Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, low hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient is currently receiving nutrition through a pulmonary formula at 45 mL/hour, and her insulin regimen has been adjusted to prevent hypoglycemia. She is also receiving medications for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include worsening of renal function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source and a new stroke. She is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and awaiting tracheostomy. She has chronic renal failure and requires hemodialysis. She also has diabetes, which requires insulin management. Her mental status is improving but she still has altered mental status. She has a history of hypertension and is currently on blood pressure medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to profuse secretions, lack of gag reflex, and poor airway posture. She is currently intubated and awaiting tracheostomy.
2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source. Although her blood cultures appear to be contaminants, she still has persistent leukocytosis. Close monitoring of clinical status is required.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and requires hemodialysis at [**Location (un) 4465**] [**Location (un) 590**] T/Th/Sat as outpatient.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient has diabetes that requires insulin management. She has recently experienced episodes of hypoglycemia, but is now stable after adjustment in her"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis. The sepsis has now been resolved. The patient's current medical conditions and plan include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient experienced failed extubation twice due to poor gag reflex and secretions. It is believed that the underlying cause may be a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and possible prior pneumonia. The plan is to pursue a tracheostomy/feeding gastrostomy (trach/peg) on Friday, hold Plavix, coordinate with the renal team for HD sessions, and provide supplemental vent management for now.

2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has resolved, with stable hemodynamics, no evidence of infection in the CNS or GPRs from January 31st blood cultures, and negative repeat cultures. The plan is to discontinue antibiotics as no source of infection was found and monitor the patient clinically.

3. New CVA: The patient has started on aspirin (ASA) and statins. Plavix is being held for the anticipated peg/trach procedure. The plan is to appreciate neurological input.

4. ESRD: The patient is on HD.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count should be monitored clinically for signs of infection"

The patient is currently being managed with tracheostomy/feeding tube placement scheduled for Friday, supplemental ventilation, and discontinuation of antibiotics as there is no evidence of ongoing infection. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate between 95-116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/29-174/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose, and lactic acid levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. Imaging shows clear chest X-ray and endotracheal tube positioned 5.4 cm above the carina. 

The patient's overall plan includes pursuing tracheostomy/feeding tube placement on Friday, coordinating with renal and HD sessions, managing supplemental ventilation, monitoring clinically for signs of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source and stroke. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and type II DM.

The patient's respiratory failure is due to profuse secretions, lack of gag reflex, and poor airway posture. She has been intubated again and is awaiting a tracheostomy.

She also has a new stroke, as evidenced by bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on her head MRI. Her mental status is slowly improving, and she has a history of CVA with right hemiparesis. She was taking aspirin despite a reported allergy to it, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) showed no evidence of an embolic course. Clopidogrel was started per neurologic recommendations but was discontinued in preparation for the tracheostomy. It is recommended to hold clopidogrel, continue aspirin while holding clopidogrel, follow up with neurology recommendations, and continue atorvastatin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis, which has since resolved. She has a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in 2017. She was extubated twice due to poor gag reflex and secretions, underlying CVA, and possible prior pneumonia. It is planned to pursue a tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) on Friday. Heparin and tube feeds will be held tonight. Supportive ventilation management will be continued for now. Sepsis is considered resolved, and the patient's hemodynamics are stable with no evidence of infection. Antibiotics have been stopped as there is no source of infection. The patient's new CVA started on [Month/Year], and she is on statin therapy. Plavix is being held for anticipated peg/trach. Neurological input is appreciated. The patient is on hemodialysis for ESRD. Leukocytosis is improving, so no empirical treatment is needed. The patient has hypertension, which will be managed with metoprolol, up-titrated to 100 [Hospital1] today and monitored. Her diabetes mellitus medication has been increased to 11 units per day of Lantus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's failed extubation attempts and underlying"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source, stroke, leukocytosis, and fever. The patient has respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, fever, and gram stain showing G+ cocci in pairs/clusters. This suggests a possible bacterial infection. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, urinary tract infection, skin infection, and endocarditis. Restarting vancomycin and obtaining follow-up sputum culture, blood culture, and urine analysis are recommended.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient failed extubation due to profuse secretions, lack of gag reflex, and poor airway posture. She is now intubated again and awaiting tracheostomy.

3. Stroke: The patient has a new stroke with bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on head MRI. Her mental status is slowly improving. She has a history of CVA with right-sided hemiparesis. Aspirin was started despite an allergy, and clopidogrel was started but discontinued in preparation for tracheostomy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source and a new stroke. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and awaiting a tracheostomy. She also has chronic renal failure and requires hemodialysis. The patient's mental status is improving, but she has a history of CVA with right hemiparesis. She was on aspirin despite having an allergy to it, and clopidogrel was started but later discontinued. The patient's leukocytosis is persistent, but her WBC count is trending down. She requires monitoring and further investigation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to profuse secretions, lack of gag reflex, and poor airway posture. She will need close monitoring and may require a tracheostomy.
2. Stroke: The patient has bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on head MRI, indicating a new stroke. She has a history of CVA with right hemiparesis. Regular neurological follow-up is necessary.
3. Sepsis: The patient presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source. She is febrile but tachycardic. Sources of infection may include decubitus ulcers, stress response, or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis. She has a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in 2017 and is currently in the ICU. Her current condition includes acute respiratory failure, fever, new leukocytosis, and a new CVA. She is on mechanical ventilation and has been extubated twice due to poor gag reflex and secretions. The patient also has hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and is on various medications including metformin, fentanyl, famotidine, nephrocaps, peridex, Lipitor, propofol, ASA, Hep sc, RISS, Lantus, and Lopressor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Fever: The presence of fever along with leukocytosis suggests an underlying infection. This could potentially progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
3. New CVA: The patient's recent history of a new CVA, in addition to her previous debilitating CVA, increases the risk of further neurological complications.
4. Aspiration: The patient's poor gag reflex and secretions may result in recurrent aspiration, leading to aspiration pneumonia.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis, which has now been resolved. She has a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) from 2017 and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection, with abnormal sputum culture results but no clear infiltrate on imaging. She also has a new CVA with a prior CVA history and is on statin therapy. The patient's other medical conditions include hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as pneumonia or acute lung injury due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and leukocytosis suggests a potential infection. If not properly managed, it could progress to sepsis or septic shock.
3. Stroke: The patient's history of debilitating CVA and the recent occurrence of a new CVA increase the risk of neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, hemorrhage, or ischemic events.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be closely monitored to prevent complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or cardiovascular events.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's diabetes mellitus needs to be managed"

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source and stroke. The patient has leukocytosis and fever, and gram stain with G+ cocci in pairs/clusters suggests a possible gram-positive bacterial infection.

The patient recently discontinued vancomycin, and there is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but the chest X-ray (CXR) yesterday was unremarkable. No clear source of skin infection is identified, and heel ulcers are improving. Endocarditis is also on the differential. The patient's urine has not been sampled, and previous C. difficile was negative without any diarrhea.

Non-infectious causes such as pancreatitis are also considered. The patient's respiratory failure is due to failed extubation caused by profuse secretions, lack of gag reflex, and poor airway posture. She is now intubated again, awaiting tracheostomy.

A new stroke is identified with bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on head MRI. The patient's mental status is slowly improving.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II (DM), and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source and was found to have leukocytosis and fever. She also experienced respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient's mental status is altered, and she has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), for which she undergoes hemodialysis as an outpatient. She has a large thyroid that needs to be addressed by thoracic surgery, which will involve a tracheostomy. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including hypertension (HTN), hyperglycemia, and a history of aspirin allergy. She is currently being treated for suspected severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and type II DM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has already experienced respiratory failure, which required intubation. She is awaiting a tracheostomy due to her large thyroid. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further respiratory complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source. She has leukocytosis and fever, indicating an ongoing infection. The source"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and presumed sepsis. Her current condition includes persistent respiratory failure, awaiting tracheostomy, and a recent spike in temperature with restarted vancomycin. She has several medical conditions including a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in 2017, fever of unclear source, new leukocytosis, abnormal sputum on February 12th, no clear infiltrate on imaging, and a new CVA with prior CVA history. She is also diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and ESRD. The patient's medications include propofol, fentanyl, heparin sodium, famotidine, nephrocaps, chlorhexidine, atorvastatin, aspirin, risser, Lantus, metoprolol, and ASA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure and failed extubation twice due to poor gag and secretions may lead to further respiratory complications.
2. Fever: The patient's new fever and leukocytosis raise concerns for infection. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection and provide appropriate treatment.
3. New CVA: With a prior CVA history and the recent occurrence of a new CVA, the patient is at risk for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis, now resolved. She has a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in 2017 and is currently experiencing a new fever of unclear source.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's failed extubation attempts due to poor gag reflex and secretions may indicate underlying CVA and possible prior pneumonia. There is a plan to pursue tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) on Friday, along with holding tube feeds and heparin for tonight. Supportive ventilation management will be continued.
2. Fever and leukocytosis: The new fever and elevated white blood cell count raise concerns for infection. Abnormal sputum was noted on February 12th, but no clear infiltrate was observed on imaging. Vancomycin therapy has been started with hemodialysis, and a straight catheter for urine analysis will be used to round out the complete blood culture. Liver function tests and amylase/lipase levels will also be monitored. There is no evidence of phlebitis.
3. New CVA: The patient has a new cerebrovascular accident with a prior CVA history. She has been started on aspirin and a statin, and Plavix will be held for anticipated PEG"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and oliguria. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. On admission, vital signs were unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. Fluid resuscitation was initiated, and vasopressors were started to maintain blood pressure. 

24-hour events include the administration of metformin, vancomycin, propofol, fentanyl, and heparin sodium. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for decreased urine output. Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with improved blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's weight has increased by 5.7 kg since admission. 

Physical examination findings are within normal limits, except for decreased breath sounds at the left lung base. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with a high of 229 mg/dL and a low of 94 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
The patient remains critically ill in the ICU with unstable vital signs, requiring continuous monitoring. The patient's decreased urine output and elevated lactate levels suggest possible acute kidney injury. Glycemic control is a concern with fluctuating blood glucose levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis, now resolved. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in 2017 and is awaiting a tracheostomy. She had a fever yesterday and was restarted on vancomycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/54 mmHg to 162/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is 70 kg, and height is 65 inches.

24-hour events include the inability to perform an invasive procedure (IP) due to enlarged thyroid (thyromegaly), deferring the procedure to thoracics and planning for Monday. The patient also spiked a fever yesterday and vancomycin was restarted. The patient is stable on maintenance medications.

Allergies include metformin, with an unknown reaction. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on February 13th, 2016, at 12:26 PM. Infusions include propofol at 5 mcg/kg/min, and other ICU medications such as fentanyl, heparin sodium, fam"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and presenting with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis, now resolved. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation (MV) due to failed extubation attempts. She has a new fever of unclear source and elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. The patient also has a new stroke, in addition to her prior CVA history, for which she has been started on aspirin and a statin, while holding Plavix. She is scheduled for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on Monday. She has ESRD and is on HD, hypertension (HTN) controlled with metoprolol, and diabetes mellitus (DM) managed with increased insulin dosage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress, leading to further deterioration in lung function and potential need for more advanced respiratory support.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection. If left untreated, it could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. New CVA: The patient's new stroke, along with her history of debilitating CVA, increases the risk of neurological complications and potential disability.
4. Complications from trache"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who has experienced multiple complications. She presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis, which has since resolved. However, she continues to have persistent respiratory failure and is awaiting a tracheostomy. The patient also has a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is at risk for further neurological complications. Her medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and an allergy to metformin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has not improved despite previous extubation attempts. She may require ongoing ventilatory support and is planned for tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to poor gag reflex and secretions.
2. Fever: The patient had an unexplained fever on [02-12], which has been trending down since starting vancomycin. Further investigation is needed, and if all cultures come back negative, empirical treatment for 8 days may be considered.
3. New CVA: The patient has developed a new stroke in addition to her prior CVA history. She has been started on aspirin and a statin, and Plavix is being held in anticipation of tracheostomy and PEG.
4. ESRD: The patient is on hemodialysis and will continue with T, Th, Sa schedule.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), who experienced respiratory failure and presumed sepsis, which has since resolved. She is currently intubated and sedated, awaiting a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tomorrow. The patient has a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) from 2/17 and presents with ongoing respiratory failure. She also has an unclear source of fever starting on 2/12. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to poor gag reflex and secretions, which led to failed extubation attempts. Underlying factors include her debilitating CVA and possible prior pneumonia. The planned tracheostomy and PEG procedures could help improve her respiratory status.
2. Fever: The patient has an unresolved fever, despite starting vancomycin. Continuing the antibiotic and following up with cultures is recommended. If all negative, empirical treatment for 8 days may be necessary.
3. New CVA with prior CVA history: The patient has developed a new cerebrovascular accident, on top of her previous CVA history. She is currently on aspirin and a statin, and Plavix is being held in anticipation of the PEG/tracheostomy procedure.
4. ESRD: The patient's end"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She is currently admitted to the ICU for possible sepsis from an unknown source and stroke. The patient has respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and type II diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to profuse secretions, no gag reflex, and poor airway posture. She is currently intubated and awaiting a tracheostomy. If the tracheostomy is unsuccessful or if there is a reinfection, the patient may require prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy tube changes.

2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis and fever, indicating a possible infection. The gram stain of her sputum showed G+ cocci in pairs/clusters. If the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly, the patient may develop septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or death.

3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has stage IV CKD and undergoes hemodialysis (HD) at specific intervals. If the HD sessions are not conducted properly or if there are complications such as access site infections or hypot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis, now resolved. She is currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure and is awaiting a tracheostomy. She has a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in 2017 and has had two failed extubations due to poor gag reflex and secretions. Her medical history includes prior pneumonia (pna) and she is currently on multiple medications for various conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. She has developed a new fever with unclear source and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. Imaging shows no clear infiltrate but abnormal sputum on 2/12. She also has a new cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with a prior CVA history and is being started on aspirin and a statin, while holding Plavix for anticipated percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg)/tracheostomy. She is on hemodialysis for her ESRD and has uncontrolled hypertension. Her diabetes management has been increased to 11 units per day.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atelectasis, or even respiratory arrest if the tracheostomy is not performed successfully.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in 2017, who presented with respiratory failure and presumed sepsis, which has since resolved. She is currently intubated and sedated. She has a fever on February 12th of unclear source. The patient's current conditions include acute respiratory failure due to failed extubation twice, an underlying CVA, and possible prior pneumonia. She also has a new CVA with a prior CVA history, started on aspirin and statin therapy, holding Plavix for anticipated percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheostomy. Other comorbidities include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's repeated extubation failures indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. The planned tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may help in managing her airway and nutritional needs.
2. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's new fever and leukocytosis raise concerns for infection. Although she has been afebrile after starting vancomycin with hemodialysis, further evaluation of the source of infection is necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presented with possible sepsis from an unknown source and stroke, and her fever has improved. The patient has respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient failed extubation due to profuse secretions, lack of gag reflex, and poor airway posture. She is currently intubated and awaiting a planned tracheostomy. She may be at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recurrent fevers despite receiving vancomycin. She may develop septic shock if her infection progresses.

3. Stroke: The patient has a new stroke with bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on head MRI. She may be at risk for further neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure or cerebral edema.

4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage IV CKD and undergoes hemodialysis at specific intervals. She may be at risk for complications related to dialysis access or electrolyte imbalances.

5. Diabetes Mellitus Type II:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute; impaired skin integrity; severe sepsis with organ dysfunction; chronic renal failure; altered mental status; hypoglycemia; and type II diabetes mellitus. The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl for pain management and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/73 to 105/31 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a tidal volume set at 340 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has a history of diabetes, chronic renal failure, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Nosocomial infection: The patient's impaired"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. He required invasive ventilation and subsequently underwent tracheostomy and gastrostomy placement. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal failure, sepsis, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity. He is currently on multiple medications including fentanyl, metoprolol, clopidogrel, and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still on mechanical ventilation. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and platelet count. There is no mention of any specific medical complications in the progress note. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters can increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.
4. Nosocomial infection: The patient's septic state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to dehydration or nephrotoxic medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and respiratory failure from pneumonia. She has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) yesterday. The patient is currently on a tracheal collar and is grimacing in pain but unable to localize the source. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 136/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, metoprolol, famotidine, nephrocaps, heparin, Lantus, Plavix, and others. She has a history of allergy to metformin. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly low sodium and potassium levels. The patient's kidney function is within normal limits, and liver enzymes are within normal range. Microbiology results are pending. 

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with tracheal collar trials, pulmonary toilet, and weaning from mechanical ventilation. Her CVA is being treated with Plavix instead of aspirin. The patient is scheduled for hemodialysis (HD) today and will start using the PEG for feeding today"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented with new-onset stroke and subsequent airway compromise leading to tracheostomy placement. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure, altered mental status, sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, and hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired respiratory function due to her recent stroke and inability to protect her airway, necessitating tracheostomy placement. Continuing tracheostomy support and monitoring for any complications related to airway management is crucial.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is non-responsive to verbal commands, which could be attributed to several factors such as pain, medication effects, or neurological complications. Pain management with morphine has been initiated, but further investigation for potential seizures or other causes of altered mental status should be considered.
3. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: Despite empirical antibiotic coverage, the patient's leukocytosis persists without a clear etiology. Close monitoring for signs of infection and organ dysfunction is necessary. If fever recurs, broader-spectrum antibiotics may be required.
4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has stage IV CKD and requires regular hemodialysis. Ensuring proper dialysis management and monitoring for complications associated with renal failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and altered mental status. He is currently in the ICU for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 88-122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/42-147/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy and receiving supplemental oxygen. His fluid balance shows an intake of 1,590 mL and output of 2,010 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 420 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 75-164 mg/dL. The assessment and plan include respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She is currently in the ICU for possible sepsis from an unknown source and stroke. Her fever has improved, and she has shown improvement in her respiratory failure, now requiring only tracheal mask ventilation. However, she still has leukocytosis and recurrent fevers despite vancomycin treatment. She also has a new stroke with bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts on head MRI. Her mental status is slowly improving, and she has a history of CVA with right hemiparesis. She undergoes hemodialysis (HD) three times a week as an outpatient. She has experienced episodes of hypoglycemia requiring frequent D10 boluses but is now stable after adjustment in her insulin regimen. She has hypertension and is maintained on lopressor at 75mg po bid, while lisinopril is held. She has an IV and PICC line in place for access. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has improved, but she still requires tracheal mask ventilation. She may be at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections due to prolonged intubation.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient's fever has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old with a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and resultant respiratory failure who is failing extubation. They have undergone a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on February 16th. The patient is experiencing poorly controlled pain, with a total of 8mg IV morphine sulfate administered in the last 3 hours. The patient has an allergy to metformin and unknown allergies. The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, are unchanged from admission except as noted above. The patient is unable to answer regarding pain.

24-hour events include pain poorly controlled, with a total of 8mg IV morphine sulfate given in the last 3 hours. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), current temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (88-122 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 134/42mmHg to 147/60mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute (13-40 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheostomy mask with FiO2 at 40%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their weight is 62.5 kg, with a height of 65 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 590mL (63mL PO, 500mL IVF), with a total output of 2010mL (8mL blood product, 610mL NG, 55mL drain). The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a tracheostomy mask, ventilator mode on standby, spontaneous tidal volume of 0mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, FiO2 at 40%, and SpO2 at 100%. The patient's ABG results are not provided.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with diaphoresis. The patient's eyes, head, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular system, respiratory system, abdomen, extremities, and skin are all within normal limits. Neurologically, the patient responds to stimuli but cannot be fully assessed due to being unable to answer, movement, tone, and grimacing and grinding teeth.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin at 8.1g/dL, leukocyte count at 397K/uL, platelet count at 107mg/dL, sodium at 135mg/dL, potassium at 4.2mEq/L, chloride at 28mEq/L, bicarbonate at 20mg/dL, BUN at 26.4mg/dL, creatinine at 3.6mg/dL, glucose at 115mg/dL, calcium at 9.9mg/dL, magnesium at"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), and previous pulmonary infection. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on [**2-16**]. 

The patient has been experiencing poorly controlled pain, for which she received a total of 8mg IV morphine sulfate in the last 3 hours. She has allergies to metformin and an unknown allergy. She is currently on several medications, including heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, fentanyl, famotidine, nephrocaps, Peridex, Lipitor, RISS, Lantus, Lopressor, and Plavix.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.6°C to 37.4°C, heart rate between 92-122 bpm, blood pressure between 134/42-147/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 590 mL and output of 2010 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1420 mL. She is receiving oxygen through a tracheostomy mask and is on standby ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 0 mL,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required tracheostomy due to inability to protect her airway after extubation. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheostomy-related infections.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
3. Severe Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which can lead to septic shock and multiple organ failure.
4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, requiring ongoing hemodialysis. There is a risk of worsening renal function and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to several factors including sepsis, hypoglycemia, or chronic kidney disease. There is a"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and a recent stroke. She presented with acute respiratory failure and was subsequently intubated, but was unable to protect her airway post-extubation, leading to the placement of a tracheostomy (trach).

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through the trach and is showing signs of pain, indicated by wincing and nonresponsiveness to verbal commands. Pain management with morphine has been initiated. There is a possibility of seizures, so an electroencephalogram (EEG) and/or head imaging may be necessary to investigate further.

Leukocytosis persists without a clear etiology. The patient has undergone courses of empiric Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Gram-negative rod (GNR) coverage antibiotics, but cultures remain unremarkable, and there is currently no fever present.

A new stroke has been identified on head MRI, with bilateral white matter lacunar infarcts. The patient's mental status is slowly improving, and she has a history of CVA with right hemiparesis. Clopidogrel and atorvastatin therapy will be continued.

The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and undergoes hemodialysis (HD) at [location] on Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday as an outpatient. Dialysis will be maintained according to schedule.

Recent episodes of hypoglycemia required frequent dextrose (D10) boluses, but the patient is now stable after adjustment in the insulin regimen. The current insulin regimen will be continued.

The patient has a history of hypertension, for which lopressor is being maintained at 75 mg orally twice daily, while lisinopril has been held.

Fluid management includes intravenous fluids (IVFs) and repletion of electrolytes as needed via tube feeding (TF).

Prophylactic measures include H2 blocker therapy, subcutaneous heparin, and no bowel regimen given due to loose stools.

Access includes peripheral intravenous (PIV) and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines.

Code status is full, discussed, and the patient's brother has been contacted. The patient's current disposition is to remain in the ICU, as she is not yet ready for discharge."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required a tracheostomy due to the inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, acute pain, impaired skin integrity, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, and hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is now trached and doing well. However, there is a potential for complications related to the tracheostomy site infection or displacement of the tracheostomy tube.
2. Wincing/Nonresponsive: The patient is currently not responsive to verbal commands. This could be due to the pain or the effects of sedation. Continuous monitoring and assessment of the patient's level of consciousness are necessary.
3. Recurrent Stroke: The patient has a history of CVA, and the recent MRI will help evaluate for recurrent stroke. If a new stroke is detected, it may lead to further neurological deficits and complications.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is improving. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection or fever, as these could indicate a worsening condition.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and requires hem"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, altered mental status, ischemic cerebrovascular accident (stroke), and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure and acute pain.

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), current temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate between 89-114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/24 mmHg to 162/68 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on tracheal mask ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, mildly elevated blood glucose levels, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function test results.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 891 mL and output of 500 mL, resulting in a balance of 391 mL.

The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of renal function. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent these complications and manage the patient's existing conditions."

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and was intubated due to the inability to protect her airway after extubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy (trach) and is doing well. 

The patient has been experiencing pain, for which she is receiving pain medication as needed. She is currently unresponsive to verbal commands, and an MRI has been ordered to evaluate for recurrent stroke. 

She also has leukocytosis, which is improving, and has been treated with antibiotics. She has stage IV chronic kidney disease and undergoes hemodialysis at two locations as an outpatient. 

The patient has a history of ileus, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Her blood glucose levels have been stable after adjustments in her insulin regimen. 

She is receiving IV fluids and nutritional support through a feeding tube. Her medications include heparin for thrombosis prevention, an H2 blocker, and insulin. 

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition remains in the ICU for now."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and subsequently required tracheostomy due to the inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube.

She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, which is being managed with continued tracheal intubation. The patient has also been experiencing episodes of pain, for which she is receiving pain medication on an as-needed basis. Her mental status is altered, and she is not responsive to verbal commands.

Laboratory findings indicate leukocytosis, but with no clear etiology. She has undergone courses of antibiotic therapy for suspected gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods infections, but cultures have been unremarkable so far, and she is currently afebrile.

The patient has chronic kidney disease (stage IV) and undergoes hemodialysis at two outpatient locations. Her diabetes mellitus type II has been managed by adjusting her insulin regimen, and she is now stable.

She has a history of hypertension, for which she is taking lopressor (metoprolol) at a dose of 75 mg twice daily, and lisinopril is being held.

The patient's ileus has been noted, and further evaluation of her gastrointestinal tube study is pending."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required a tracheostomy due to an inability to protect her airway after extubation. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure but is doing well with the tracheostomy. She has increased secretions, so her temperature and white blood cell count will be monitored to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP).

The patient is also displaying minimal neurological status and is experiencing left occipital seizures. She has been started on keppra. Neurological follow-up recommendations have been given, and she will continue taking Plavix and atorvastatin for stroke prevention.

Her leukocytosis is improving/stable, but no clear etiology has been identified. She has undergone courses of empiric gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rod coverage antibiotics.

The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and undergoes hemodialysis at [location] on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday as an outpatient. She will continue with her scheduled dialysis.

She is experiencing ileus, which is resolving. She is having bowel movements but still has residuals. It is planned to start reglan today to reduce residuals and then initiate tube feeds. Nasal gastric tube (NG) will be used to treat narcotic-induced ileus.

Her diabetes management will continue"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required tracheostomy due to inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, and a history of ischemic stroke. She also has diabetes mellitus type II and requires insulin regimen adjustment to manage hypoglycemia episodes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent stroke: The patient's recent stroke and history of CVA indicate an increased risk for future strokes. An MRI evaluation is recommended to assess for recurrent stroke.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and courses of empiric antibiotic coverage suggest a possible infection. Monitoring for fever and further investigation is necessary to rule out any ongoing infection.
3. Diabetic complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II increases the risk of complications such as hypoglycemia and diabetic retinopathy. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and appropriate insulin management are essential.
4. Renal function: The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage IV and requires regular hemodialysis. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting the dialysis regimen based on laboratory values is important."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and subsequently underwent tracheostomy due to an inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, seizure activity, pain control issues, impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated and placed on a tracheostomy due to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is crucial. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to increased secretions. Appropriate antibiotic coverage may be necessary.

2. Seizure Activity: The patient has experienced several episodes of left occipital seizure activity. Antiepileptic medication, such as fosphenytoin, has been initiated. Further evaluation of the underlying cause of seizures, including imaging studies and electroencephalogram (EEG), is recommended.

3. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain. Adequate pain management is essential to improve her comfort and overall well-being. Analgesic medications, such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid),"

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and presented with a new stroke. She is currently intubated and has undergone tracheostomy due to the inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, but is doing well from a respiratory standpoint. She has increased secretions and is being monitored for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

The patient's mental status is very minimal, and the neurologist suspects occipital seizures. Keppra has been started for seizure management. The neurologist recommends further follow-up and continuing Plavix and atorvastatin for stroke management.

The patient's leukocytosis is improving/stable without a clear etiology. She has undergone courses of empiric Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Gram-negative rods (GNR) coverage antibiotics.

The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and undergoes hemodialysis (HD) at [Location (un) 4465] and [Location (un) 590] on Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday as an outpatient. She will continue with dialysis per schedule.

The patient's ileus is resolving, and she is having bowel movements but still has residuals. It is planned to start reglan today to reduce residuals and then initiate tube feeds. She may also receive PO narcan to treat narcotic ileus"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required a tracheostomy due to the inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient has experienced seizures and altered mental status, for which she is being treated with levetiracetam and lorazepam. She also has respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, and a history of ischemic stroke. The patient's neurological status is very minimal, and the likelihood of meaningful recovery is low. The patient is currently on dialysis and receiving nutrition through a feeding tube. Her blood glucose levels are unstable, ranging from 97 to 220 mg/dL. The patient's blood pressure is normal, and she is on metoprolol for hypertension. The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Her code status is full, and her disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has had episodes of teeth clenching, which may be correlated with seizures. She is currently on levetiracetam, but further monitoring and management may be required.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is now trached and doing well from a respiratory standpoint. However, there is still a risk of complications related to mechanical ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and was subsequently intubated due to the inability to protect her airway. She is currently on a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. The patient has altered mental status, which neurologically is believed to be due to occipital seizures, for which she has been started on keppra. She also has respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. Other medical conditions include hypoglycemia and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to her immunocompromised state from chronic illnesses and prolonged hospitalization.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and decreased venous return can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts her at risk for developing pressure ulcers, especially due to prolonged periods of immobility.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's ileus is resolving, but there is still a risk of gastrointestinal complications such as aspiration"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required tracheostomy due to airway protection issues after extubation. The patient is currently experiencing seizures, altered mental status, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, ischemic stroke, altered mental status (not delirium), hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has been experiencing intermittent jaw clenching and eye fluttering, which are indicative of seizures. These episodes have been monitored on EEG without evidence of seizure since 02/20. The patient is currently on levetiracetam, and further evaluation with lumbar puncture (LP) is planned to assess for possible herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalopathy.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status remains unchanged since the weekend, and she is unable to follow commands. Continuous EEG monitoring is being continued for now.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is now on tracheostomy and is doing well from a respiratory standpoint. Tracheostomy mask will be continued.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has evidence of minimal serosanguinous discharge at the G-tube site, indicating potential skin breakdown. Regular assessment and appropriate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and a previous stroke. She presented with a new stroke and required a tracheostomy due to her inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient has experienced seizures and altered mental status, for which she is being treated with levetiracetam and lorazepam. She is currently on a tracheostomy mask and continues to show minimal neurological improvement. The family has been informed about the low likelihood of meaningful recovery, and discussions regarding prognosis are ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is now trached and doing well from a respiratory standpoint. However, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and tracheostomy site infection.
2. Stroke: The patient has had a recent stroke, and there is a possibility of further neurological decline or development of new neurological deficits.
3. Seizures: The patient has experienced seizures, and there is a risk of recurrent seizures or status epilepticus.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and requires hemodialysis. There is a risk of complications related to dialysis access and fluid balance.
5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has poorly controlled blood glucose levels, indicating a risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia-related complications.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a small hematoma at the G-tube site, which may lead to skin breakdown or infection.
7. Prolonged Immobility: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory support may result in prolonged immobility, increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pressure ulcers, and muscle weakness.
8. Medication Reactions: The patient has allergies to metformin and unknown medications. There is a risk of adverse drug reactions or interactions.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, neurological function, seizure activity, fluid balance, blood glucose levels, and renal function. Regular assessment and prompt management of potential complications are necessary to optimize the patient's outcome."

   Assessment:
   1)      Mental Status Change: Has history of new infarcts on
   presentation to hospital but decline in mental status occurred
   subsequently so not exactly clear of etiology at present.  It is
   possible that there is just progression of infarctions in watershed
   territory.   However, one component that has not been considered is a
   nutritional one specifically she appears quite malnourished (diffuse
   muscle atrophy) and is at high-risk for Wernicke
s Encephalopathy,
   Acute Pellagra Encephalopathy, and even pyrdoxine deficiency (as a
   contributor to seizures).  We will check vitamin levels and then
   provide intravenous vitamin support and re-evaluate.
   2)      ESRD
   3)      Respiratory Failure
 on trach shield and off ventilator
   4)      Deconditioning
   Plan:
   1)      Lumbar Puncture, Nutritional repletion and review mental status
   after these interventions
   2)      Continue EEG and seizure control
   3)      Physical Therapy

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman admitted on [**2156-1-31**] with respiratory failure suspected to be sepsis. She has a history of debilitating CVA (cerebrovascular accident) and is currently experiencing persistent seizing episodes. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on [**2156-2-16**]. She has failed extubation twice and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status with recurrent seizures: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to her underlying CVA, and the persistent seizing episodes further complicate her condition. It is important to discuss the prognosis of seizure control and mental status with the neurologist and consider a lumbar puncture (LP) if necessary. The medication Keppra should be continued and its level should be checked. Reglan should be held to minimize the risk of medication-induced movement disorders.

2. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient is stable on tracheostomy collar, indicating that she requires long-term respiratory support.

3. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD): The patient is dependent on intermittent HD, which suggests that she has ESRD and requires ongoing renal replacement therapy.

4. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count may be due to post-ictal state following the seizures. Monitoring of the leuk"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and was subsequently intubated and then tracheostomized due to her inability to protect her airway after extubation. She has been experiencing seizures and altered mental status, for which she is being treated with levetiracetam. The patient also has a history of respiratory failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage IV, ileus, diabetes mellitus, hypertension (HTN), and femoral neck fracture (FEN).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/23 mmHg to 159/122 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on T-piece with supplemental oxygen. She is currently receiving hydromorphone (Dilaudid) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) through IV infusions.

Physical examination reveals significant muscle atrophy of the extremities, pupils that are minimally reactive to light, distant heart sounds, and no pedal edema. Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), as well as anemia with a hematoc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and was intubated but subsequently extubated due to the inability to protect her airway. She underwent a lumbar puncture (LP) which showed benign results. She is currently on a tracheostomy (trach) and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 159/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on Fio2 of 0.35. Physical examination reveals muscle wasting, warm and perfused extremities, and poor responsiveness. The patient's white blood cell count has increased to 14.9. The assessment includes mental status change, increased white blood cell count, ESRD, respiratory failure, and deconditioning.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), who presented with a new stroke and subsequently underwent a tracheostomy due to her inability to protect her airway after extubation. She has been experiencing seizures and altered mental status, for which levetiracetam has been continued. The patient's stroke management involves continuing clopidogrel and aspirin. She is now successfully on a tracheostomy and doing well from a respiratory standpoint.

Other medical issues include stage IV chronic kidney disease, ileus that has resolved, and diabetes mellitus, for which her current insulin regimen will be continued. Her blood pressure is normal, so metoprolol will be continued at 75 mg orally twice a day.

The patient is receiving IV fluids and repletion of electrolytes as needed, as well as a fiber supplement through nutrition. Prophylactic measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. A PICC line has been placed for access.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizures: The patient is experiencing seizures and altered mental status. If left untreated or poorly managed, these seizures can lead to further neurological deterioration and increased risk of falls or injury.

2. Stroke: The patient has had a recent stroke. If not properly managed, there is a risk of additional"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required tracheostomy due to the inability to protect her airway after extubation. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased Respiratory Secretions/Leukocytosis: The patient has increased respiratory secretions with faint crackles on the left lower base, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She has been started on cefepime/ciprofloxacin for empiric treatment.
2. Seizures/Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status and seizures, which may be related to infection or other neurological issues. Levetiracetam has been continued, and further investigations such as neuro recommendations, EEG monitoring, niacin and thiamin follow-up, and final LP cultures are planned.
3. Stroke: The patient has a history of stroke and is on clopidogrel and aspirin therapy to prevent further strokes.
4. Pain: The patient requires pain management, and a fentanyl patch at 12.5mcg/hr has been continued.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially managed with non-invasive ventilation but required tracheostomy due to respiratory failure. She is currently doing well with a tracheost"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and subsequently required a tracheostomy due to an inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient is currently experiencing seizures and altered mental status, which have been monitored on EEG without evidence of seizure since February 20th. Her mental status remains unchanged. She is being treated with levetiracetam and will be converted to oral medication as her gastric emptying improves. An LP has been ordered to evaluate for possible HSV encephalopathy. Nutrient levels, including thiamine, niacin, and pyridoxine, will also be checked due to the patient's malnourished appearance. 

The patient is on continued therapy for stroke management with clopidogrel and aspirin. She is currently intubated and doing well from a respiratory standpoint. The goal of care is minimal neurological status, and a family meeting has been scheduled to discuss prognosis with the patient's brother. 

Leukocytosis has resolved without a clear etiology, and the patient has received courses of empiric GPC and GNR coverage antibiotics. She has stage IV chronic kidney disease and undergoes hemodialysis at [location] on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays as an outpatient. Her ileus has resolved, and she is now"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required tracheostomy due to inability to protect her airway after extubation.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Increased respiratory secretions/leukocytosis: Gram-negative rods found in sputum, faint crackles on left lower base.
2. Seizures/altered mental status: MS opens eyes to voice, not following commands. No recent seizures. Possible infection contributing.
3. Stroke: Continuation of clopidogrel and aspirin.
4. Pain: Continuation of fentanyl patch at 12.5 mcg/hr.
5. Respiratory failure: Tracheostomy in place, doing well from a respiratory standpoint.
6. Diarrhea/leukocytosis: CDiff negative x1.
7. Stage IV chronic kidney disease: Continuation of thrice-weekly hemodialysis (HD).
8. Diabetes mellitus: Continuation of current insulin regimen.
9. Hypertension: Stable blood pressure, continuation of metoprolol at 75 mg po bid.
10. Fluid/electrolyte imbalance: IVFs/replete lytes prn/TF.
11. Prophylaxis: H2 blocker, heparin SQ.
12. Access: PICC (1 lumen functional).
13. Code status: Full code, confirmed with healthcare provider.
14. Contact: Brother.
15. Disposition: Call out to floor.

The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.6 and sputum growing gram-negative rods. Her chest X-ray reveals a retrocardiac infiltrate, indicating possible pneumonia. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes mental status change, pneumonia, ESRD, respiratory failure, deconditioning, and chronic kidney disease. The plan involves starting antibiotics for pneumonia, physical therapy, case management for discharge planning, continuation of hemodialysis, and other supportive measures.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details may be necessary for a comprehensive evaluation."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged woman with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been experiencing encephalopathy with an unclear etiology. She also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal failure, previous cerebrovascular accident (stroke), and pain control issues due to both acute and chronic pain.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/45 mmHg to 91/23 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask and is using a T-piece for respiratory support.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,316 mL and output of 1,695 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 379 mL. Her weight has decreased from 64.3 kg at admission to 62.5 kg currently.

The physical examination reveals significant muscle atrophy of extremities, pupils that are minimally reactive to light, trace bilateral pedal edema, and a dressing on the left heel eschar. The abdominal examination is unremarkable, except for a minimal serosanguinous discharge from the G-tube site.

The laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematoc"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and subsequently underwent tracheostomy due to the inability to protect her airway after extubation.
- She has experienced seizures and altered mental status, which were evaluated by a neurologist. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture (LP) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results were benign, so she is being continued on levetiracetam. EEG monitoring will be continued, and niacin and thiamin supplementation will be followed up.
- The patient also had a stroke, for which she is being continued on clopidogrel and aspirin.
- She experiences occasional pain, and a fentanyl patch will be started at 12.5mcg/hr.
- Her respiratory failure has improved, and she is now doing well with a tracheostomy.
- She had diarrhea and leukocytosis, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) testing has been sent.
- The goal of care will involve a family meeting today.
- She has stage IV chronic kidney disease.
- She previously had an ileus but has since resolved and is having bowel movements.
- Her diabetes mellitus type II is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and currently presenting with new-onset stroke. She underwent tracheostomy due to an inability to protect her airway after extubation.

The patient's medical complications and potential issues include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently tracheostomized and doing well from a respiratory standpoint. However, there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Seizures and altered mental status: The patient has experienced seizures and altered mental status, which may be attributed to an infection. It is important to continue antiepileptic medication, follow up with neurologic recommendations, and monitor for any further seizures.

3. Stroke: The patient has a history of stroke and is currently on antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin. Close monitoring and management of her neurological condition are essential.

4. Pain management: The patient requires pain control, both acute and chronic. Fentanyl patch at 12.5mcg/hr has been prescribed for pain management.

5. Renal failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease (stage IV), and hemodialysis (HD) is being performed three times per week.

6. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's diabetes should be managed through her current"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and subsequently required tracheostomy due to her inability to protect her airway after extubation.

The patient's current medical complications and conditions include:
1. Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS)
2. Impaired skin integrity
3. Chronic renal failure (CRF)
4. Altered mental status (not delirium)
5. Hypoglycemia
6. Diabetes mellitus type II

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP): The patient has increased respiratory secretions and leukocytosis with GNR in sputum, faint crackles on the left lower base, and is already being treated empirically with cefepime and ciprofloxacin.
2. Seizures: The patient has altered mental status and possible infection contributing to seizures. Levetiracetam is being continued, and further neurologic recommendations will be followed up.
3. Stroke: The patient continues to be on clopidogrel and aspirin for stroke management.
4. Pain: The patient requires pain control, and a fentanyl patch at 12.5mcg/hr is being continued.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is now tracheostom"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and current severe sepsis. She presented with a new stroke and subsequently underwent tracheostomy due to an inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient has been experiencing fevers, altered mental status, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, and hypoglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's increased leukocytosis and fevers suggest a possible infection. The respiratory culture showed positive for enterobacter, which is resistant to ciprofloxacin. Therefore, she should continue with renally dosed cefepime and start vancomycin.
2. Aspiration: The patient's tube feeds were suctioned from the endotracheal tube, indicating a high likelihood of aspiration. Tube feeds should be restarted at a lower rate this evening, and reglan should be started when restarting tube feeds.
3. Seizures/Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status change could be due to infection or other factors. She should continue with levetiracetam and follow up neuro recommendations.
4. Stroke: The patient has a history of stroke, and her condition requires continued monitoring.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is now trached and doing well from a respiratory standpoint. She"

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required a tracheostomy due to her inability to protect her airway after extubation. 

She is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications. These include hypotension, increased leukocytosis/fevers, seizures/altered mental status, stroke, pain, respiratory status, stage IV chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and femoral nerve entrapment (FEN).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 107/36 to 92/17 mmHg, heart rate between 86 and 125 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count (22.2 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (7.2 g/dL), elevated creatinine (5.3 mg/dL), elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing hemodialysis three times a week, changing antibiotics due to persistent fever and leukocytosis, managing seizures, optimizing pain control, monitoring respiratory status, and managing diabetes mellitus. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further infection, worsening of renal function"

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required intubation due to an inability to protect her airway. She underwent tracheostomy (trach) placement and is currently in the ICU.

Her current weight is 62.5 kg.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension following hemodialysis (HD), which is likely due to fluid removal. This was improved with a 1L fluid bolus.
2. Increased leukocytosis/fevers: The patient's white blood cell count remains elevated at 22,400 cells/mm³. She had been afebrile for the past 24 hours, but now has developed a fever. The only known source of infection is E. cloacae in her sputum. The antibiotics were changed from cefepime to meropenem and vancomycin yesterday.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required tracheostomy due to an inability to protect her airway after extubation.

The patient experienced hypotension following hemodialysis (HD), which improved with a 1L fluid bolus. She also had increased leukocytosis and fevers, with a white blood cell count of 22,000. The only known source of infection is E. cloacae in her sputum. The antibiotic regimen was changed from cefepime to meropenem and vancomycin yesterday.

The patient is currently experiencing seizures and altered mental status. She opens her eyes to voice but does not follow commands. There are no recent seizures, but possible infection may be contributing to her condition. She continues on levetiracetam and will follow up with neuro recommendations. She will also be monitored for niacin and thiamin levels.

The patient is tolerating tube feeds, which were started after administering intravenous erythromycin prior to initiating tube feeding. Her respiratory status is stable since she was intubated and tracheostomized.

The patient's pain is managed with a fentanyl patch increased to 25mcg/hr, as she appeared to be in pain on the 12mcg patch"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required intubation due to the inability to protect her airway. She has been in the ICU since then. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, increased leukocytosis/fevers, altered mental status, tolerating tube feeds, stable respiratory status, stage IV chronic kidney disease, DM, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Mental Status Change: The patient's mental status has been persistently altered, likely due to watershed infarctions. Close monitoring and neurologic follow-up are recommended.
2) Pneumonia: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and fever, indicating a possible infection. The recent change in antibiotic coverage suggests that the causative organism may be E. cloacae. Continued monitoring and evaluation of the patient's respiratory status are necessary.
3) Seizures: The patient is on levetiracetam for seizures. It is important to continue seizure prophylaxis and follow up with neurologic recommendations.
4) ESRD: The patient has stage IV chronic kidney disease and requires continued hemodialysis (HD) three times per week.
5) DM: The patient's diabetes should be managed with continued insulin therapy.
6) CVA: The patient's history of cerebro"

 switched to Meropenum for
   better coverage of enterocloace that has grown from culture
   2)       Continue Keppra for seizures
   Time Spent: 30 minutes
   ------ Protected Section ------
   Addendum to my plan above: Will hold of on placement today given
   pneumonia is still active with episode of hypotension yesterday,
   persistent WBC, and change in antibiotics today.  If improved
   overnight, can go to rehab when available.  Also, note that in the late
   afternoon, we noted a firm discrete mass in the abdomen near incision
   site for PEG when nurse alerted us to some drainage from the area.  We
   will get an ultrasound to evaluate for hematoma or abscess and consult
   the surgery group that placed the PEG to evaluate.  This issue must
   also be addressed prior to movement to rehab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required a tracheostomy due to her inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient has been experiencing hypotension following hemodialysis, persistent leukocytosis, seizures, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, and a history of CVA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive following hemodialysis, which could be due to fluid removal. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Persistent Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) despite being afebrile for more than 48 hours. The source of infection is currently believed to be E. Cloacae in the sputum. Antibiotic therapy has been changed to meropenem and vancomycin. It is important to continue monitoring the WBC count and assess for any signs of infection.
3. Seizures/Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing seizures and altered mental status. Possible contributing factors include infection or underlying neurological conditions. It is crucial to continue seizure prophylaxis and follow up with neurologic recommendations.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and subsequently underwent tracheostomy due to her inability to protect her airway after extubation.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension following hemodialysis, likely due to fluid removal. This was improved with a 1L fluid bolus.

2. Increased leukocytosis/fevers: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count of 22,000 and has been experiencing fevers. The only known source of infection is E. Cloacae in the sputum. Antibiotic therapy was changed from cefepime to meropenem and vancomycin yesterday.

3. Seizures/altered mental status: The patient is experiencing seizures and altered mental status. She opens her eyes to voice but does not follow commands. Possible infection may be contributing to these symptoms. Levetiracetam therapy is continued, and neurologic recommendations are being followed up.

4. Tube feeds: The patient tolerated tube feeding (TF) after starting it with IV erythromycin.

5. Stroke: No active issues related to the stroke were observed. The patient continues to take clopidogrel and aspirin.

6. Pain: The patient appeared to"

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presented with a new stroke and subsequently required tracheostomy due to an inability to protect her airway after extubation.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, which improved with a fluid bolus following hemodialysis. She also has leukocytosis with fevers, and her white blood cell count remains elevated at 22,000. She has been changed from cefepime to meropenem and vancomycin. The source of infection appears to be E. Cloacae in her sputum.

She is experiencing seizures and altered mental status, with the patient opening her eyes to voice but not following commands. Infection may be contributing to these symptoms. She is being continued on levetiracetam and will follow up with neurologic recommendations. Her nutritional status is also being monitored, with the initiation of tube feeds and the use of erythromycin prior to starting total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

The patient has a history of stroke, for which she is being continued on clopidogrel and aspirin. She is also experiencing acute and chronic pain, for which her fentanyl patch dose has been increased to 25mcg/hr.

Respiratory status is stable following tracheostomy, and plans are in"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA) admitted on February 31st with respiratory failure suspected to be sepsis. There is also a high suspicion for recurrent CVA during this time. The patient has failed extubation twice and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on February 16th. She is currently awaiting rehabilitation but has recently been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is now on meropenem.

The patient has a concern for abscess at one of the laparoscopic incision sites, although surgery does not seem concerned. Her leukocytosis remains without a clear source, though decreasing today. The abdominal collection is quite small but concerning for an abscess. Further discussion with surgery regarding additional studies such as a CT scan is planned. The patient also needs new access, which will be discussed with the venous access team.

Regarding lab results, the patient's white blood cell count has been increasing, with values ranging from 12.8 to 22.4 thousand/mm3. Her hematocrit levels have been relatively stable between 26.1% and 28.3%. The platelet count has shown fluctuations, ranging from 93 to 156 thousand/mm3. Renal function tests indicate elevated creatinine levels, with values between 2.7"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of debilitating cerebral vascular accident (CVA). She was admitted on [2156-1-31] with respiratory failure suspected to be secondary to sepsis. The patient also had a high suspicion for recurrent CVA during this time. She failed extubation twice on [2-4] and [2-6]. She underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on [2156-2-16] and is currently awaiting rehabilitation. However, she was recently diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is now on meropenem.

The patient has a concern for abscess at one of the laparoscopic surgery sites. Her leukocytosis remains without a clear source, although it is decreasing today. The abdominal collection is quite small but is concerning for an abscess. Further discussion with surgery regarding additional studies such as a CT scan will be done.

The patient needs new access, which will be discussed with the venous access team. Additionally, her thyroid function tests (TFTs) will be rechecked given her very low TSH in the past.

ICU care includes nutrition support with NovaSource Renal (Full) at 45 mL/hour, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and underwent tracheostomy due to an inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, chronic renal failure, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and hypoglycemia. She is currently receiving various treatments and medications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and fever, indicating a possible infection. The source of infection is currently being investigated, and antibiotics have been changed to cover a broader range of bacteria.
2. Seizures: The patient experienced a seizure, which may be related to her altered mental status. She is being monitored closely, and antiepileptic medication has been started.
3. Pain management: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, and her pain management regimen has been adjusted to better control her pain.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient required tracheostomy due to respiratory failure, and she is now stable on tracheal mask ventilation. Trach sutures will be removed soon.
5. Renal failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is undergoing hemodialysis three times a week.
6. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes is being managed with an insulin regimen.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and previous stroke. She presented with a new stroke and required intubation due to the inability to protect her airway. She was subsequently placed on mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy was performed.

The patient has been experiencing persistent leukocytosis despite discontinuing standing Tylenol, and her fever from 72 hours ago has resolved. The PICC line has been removed as a possible source of infection. She is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem and vancomycin.

The patient is also experiencing seizures and altered mental status, which may be related to an infection. She is currently on levetiracetam for seizure control. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, but her calcium level is slightly elevated. Her kidney function tests show chronic renal failure.

Other medical conditions include acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, history of cerebrovascular accident (stroke), and altered mental status. She also has a history of hypoglycemia and type II diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current plan of care includes continuing antibiotic therapy, monitoring for any changes in culture results, and holding standing Tylenol. She is to continue with neurologic recommendations and follow-up labs such as niacin, thiamine, and CSF lactate. Her stroke"

","The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and previous stroke. She presented with a new stroke and subsequently underwent tracheostomy due to the inability to protect her airway after extubation.

The patient's current condition includes persistent leukocytosis, altered mental status, respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, chronic renal failure, and a history of CVA. She also has a fever that has resolved, seizures, pain, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient is being treated with various medications, including antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin) for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), levetiracetam for seizures, insulin for diabetes management, and fentanyl patch for pain control. She is also receiving tube feeds with PO erythromycin and undergoing hemodialysis for ESRD.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Infection: The patient has persistent leukocytosis and was previously febrile. She is at risk for developing further infections, especially given her impaired immune system due to ESRD and diabetes.

2. Seizure recurrence: Although the patient has been on levetiracetam, there is still a risk of seizure recurrence, especially if the underlying cause is not adequately controlled.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient has acute respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type II, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA).
- She presented with a new stroke and required intubation due to inability to protect her airway, resulting in the placement of a tracheostomy (trach).
- The patient has persistent leukocytosis, fever, and a possible source of infection from the PICC line, which has been removed.
- She is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem and vancomycin.
- The patient is experiencing seizures and altered mental status, with possible infection contributing to the condition.
- She has chronic renal failure and requires hemodialysis.
- The patient's pain, respiratory status, and diabetes mellitus are also being managed accordingly.
- Her nutrition is being provided through tube feeds, and she is on multiple medications for prophylaxis and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's persistent leukocytosis, fever, and previous PICC line removal indicate a possible ongoing infection. There is also evidence of VAP, which should be closely monitored and treated appropriately.
2. Seizures: The patient is experiencing seizures, and further evaluation and management of the underlying cause are necessary.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status requires ongoing assessment and management, considering the possibility of infection"

She experienced seizures last week and is currently on Keppra but her mental status remains depressed. Lumbar puncture (LP) was negative. 

The patient has been doing well and remains stable. She still has leukocytosis but is afebrile now off Tylenol and without a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. If her temperature spikes again, a chest and abdomen CT may be needed. She will continue an 8-day course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She will need a new PICC line prior to transfer to rehabilitation.

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 188/81 to 194/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a T-piece. She is well-nourished and not in acute"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 43-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a debilitating cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted on January 31st with respiratory failure suspected to be sepsis, with a high suspicion for recurrent CVA. She has had multiple failed extubations and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on February 16th. She experienced seizures last week and is currently on Keppra, but her mental status remains depressed. Lumbar puncture (LP) results were negative.

The patient is currently stable and doing well. She still has leukocytosis but is afebrile now off tylenol and without a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. If her temperature spikes again, it is likely that a chest and abdomen CT will be needed. She will continue an 8-day course of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She will require a new PICC line prior to transfer to rehabilitation.

In terms of ICU care, she is receiving NovaSource Renal (Full) nutrition through a feeding tube at a rate of 45 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained with regular insulin sliding scale. She has a 22-gauge line in place. Prophylactic measures include boots, subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for deep vein"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required tracheostomy due to inability to protect airway after extubation.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/70 to 188/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's physical examination revealed a small abdominal hematoma around the laparoscopy site but no other significant findings.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range.
- The patient's WBC count has been trending down, and she remains afebrile. She is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem and vancomycin. A PICC line is being placed today.
- The patient is experiencing seizures and altered mental status. She is on levetiracetam and will have follow-up with a neurologist.
- The patient's stroke is stable, and she is on clopidogrel and aspirin.
- The patient's pain has improved with a higher dose fentanyl patch.
- The patient's respiratory status is stable, and she will continue with tracheostomy and tracheal mask.
- The patient requires hemodialysis for her ESRD.
- The patient has bruxism, and it is recommended to call a dentist for a mouth guard.
- The patient's diabetes management will continue with her current insulin regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings are elevated, indicating a risk of hypertension-related complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
2. Persistent Leukocytosis: The elevated WBC count suggests an ongoing infection or inflammation. If not properly managed, it may lead to further complications such as sepsis or organ dysfunction.
3. Seizures/Altered Mental Status: The patient's seizures and altered mental status may be due to various causes including the recent stroke, medication side effects, or metabolic imbalances. Proper management is crucial to prevent further neurological complications.
4. VAP: The patient is being treated for VAP, which is a common complication in critically ill patients. Failure to adequately treat the infection may lead to worsening respiratory status and potential spread of the infection.
5. ESRD: The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing management with hemodialysis. Failure to maintain adequate renal function can result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infections.
6. DM: The patient's diabetes management is essential to prevent hyperglycemia-related complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and was subsequently intubated due to an inability to protect her airway. She has been placed on a tracheostomy (trach) and is currently on a t-piece ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 98.5°F (37.5°C)
- Pulse: 95 bpm
- Blood pressure: 128/70 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% with FiO2 of 0.35

Physical examination reveals that the patient's eyes are closed and she is not following commands. Her lung fields are clear bilaterally. Her heart rhythm is sinus regular, and she has s1 and s2 present. Her abdomen is soft with no erythema around the gastrostomy tube, but there is a small abdominal hematoma at the laparoscopic site. There is no peripheral edema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22.4 K/uL, which is trending down. Other lab values include hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, creatinine of 3.9 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She presented with a new stroke and required tracheostomy due to an inability to protect her airway after extubation. The patient is currently in the ICU, where she is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been consistently elevated, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. Monitoring and adjusting antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
2. Seizures/altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status and has a history of seizures. Continued treatment with levetiracetam, along with further investigation of niacin and thiamine levels, as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate, may be needed to manage this condition.
3. Stroke: The patient's recent stroke requires ongoing management with antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel and aspirin.
4. Tube feeds: The patient is receiving tube feeds, which need to be monitored for any complications like aspiration or improper nutrition.
5. Pain management: The patient is on a fentanyl patch for pain control, and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly based on her pain level assessments.
6. Respiratory status: The patient's respiratory"
