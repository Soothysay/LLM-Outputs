   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 7854**] is a 20 year old previously healthy female admitted to the
   MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever.
   .
   # Fever/Bandemia/tachycardia: Meets criteria for sepsis.  Patient
   received an additional 3L of IVF overnight. Presumptive diagnosis is
   Lemierre
s given the h/o severe sore throat and neck pain followed by
   hypoxia as well as the CT chest c/w septic emboli in setting of growing
   anaerobic GNRs at the OSH. However, the CT of the neck was negative for
   thrombophlebitis although this is only positive in 30-40% of cases.
   Other potential sources include an abdominal source given her original
   presentation including abdominal pain and concern for an acute abdomen.
   Potential alternatives include bacterial pneumonia/CAP, atypical
   pneumonia, although these are less likely.  TTE showed no vegetations,
   ruling out endocarditis as a source of septic emboli.
   -Monitor hemodynamics (MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hour)

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 7854] is a 20-year-old previously healthy female admitted to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever. She meets criteria for sepsis and has a presumptive diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome given her history of severe sore throat and neck pain followed by hypoxia. Other potential sources of infection include an abdominal source, bacterial pneumonia/CAP, atypical pneumonia, although these are less likely. The patient has received an additional 3L of IVF overnight. TTE showed no vegetations, ruling out endocarditis as a source of septic emboli.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets criteria for sepsis and is at risk of further complications associated with systemic infection, such as organ dysfunction, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), septic shock, and death.
2. Lemierre syndrome: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings suggest Lemierre syndrome, which is a rare complication of oropharyngeal infection leading to thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, septic emboli, and potentially life-threatening consequences.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old female with no known drug allergies. She was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and antibiotics, but her condition has not improved significantly.

The patient's vital signs show persistent tachycardia and hypoxia, with a maximum temperature of 103.2°F (39.6°C) recorded. Her blood pressure is within normal limits, and her respiratory rate is slightly elevated. The oxygen saturation level is 94% on 6L nasal cannula.

Her physical examination reveals no apparent distress, with sleepy mannerisms. The HEENT examination is normal, but there is tenderness over the left lateral neck adjacent to the airway. The cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm with normal rate and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The lung examination reveals diffuse crackles, especially on the left side. The abdomen is soft and non-distended with diffuse tenderness. There is no hepatosplenomegaly or edema. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 9.4K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 58 K/u"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 7854**] is a 20 year old previously healthy female admitted to the
   MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever.
   .
   # Fever/Bandemia/tachycardia: Meets criteria for SIRS with concern for
   infectious process (i.e. sepsis).  Patient has received a total of 10
   liters of IVF (4L OSH, 6L [**Hospital1 19**] ED) with most recent venous lactate of
   2.1.  Potential sources include bacterial pneumonia/CAP, atypical
   pneumonia including Legionella, MTB or atypical mycobacterium.  IJ
   thrombophlebitis after pharyngitis is also a distinct possibility with
   pulmonary nodules representing septic emboli/developing cavitary
   lesions.  Extra-pulmonary infectious sources including Ehrlichia given
   fever, bandemia, HA, thombocytopenia, anemia, and LFT abnormalities
   especially as patient may have been at risk.  Patient was Influenza A+B
   and monospot negative at OSH. Patient has no risk factors for HIV but
   cannot be ruled out at this time.
   - Monitor hemodynamics (MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hour) with IVF boluses prn.
   - Recheck venous lactate
   - Levofloxacin and doxycline for CAP, atypical and tick borne
   illnesses. Low threshold to expand coverage if hemodynamically
   unstable.
   - Follow-up BCx, final CT read. Can consider bedside U/S to assess for
   IJ thrombus suggestive of thrombophlebitis and starting anaerobic GNR
   coverage (i.e. fusobacterium) coverage with pip/tazo, imipenem, or
   ticarcillin-clav.  If clinical suspicion increases, will order CT neck
   w/ and w/o contrast.
   - Given possibility of septic emboli, will also check TTE. No murmurs
   on exam. Low threshold for expanding coverage.
   - Check Legionella urinary antigen, Ehrlichia and lyme serologies,
   thick and thin smear
   - Recheck monospot, EBV serology
   - Follow-up OSH culture data
   - Repeat BCx
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient with new oxygen requirement with abnormal CTA chest
   demonstrating scattered ground glass opacities and pulmonary nodules
   versus septic emboli with concern for cavitary RUL lesion.  Given
   overall clinical picture, infectious process is much more likely,
   although non-infectious etiologies including nodular sarcoid are on the
   differential.
   - Negative pressure isolation for now.
   - Cover for CAP and atypical pna with levofloxacin.
   - Check ABG
   - Follow-up final CTA chest read. Will need to consider MTB and
   atypical mycobacterium rule out with induced sputum x3 if read
   continues as cavitary.  Will also need to consider alternative
   diagnoses for cavitary lesion including fungal (Aspergillosis, Cocci,
   Histo) or malignancy.
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Hyperbilirubinemia: Mixed direct and indirect
   hyperbilirubinemia.  Repeat RUQ U/S negative for acute biliary
   process.
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Trend hyperbili, check hemolysis labs.
   - Follow-up final CT read to r/o appendicitis.
   - Supportive care, analgesia prn.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Smear negative for
   schistocytes, although coagulopathy, anemia, and thrombocytopenia
   somewhat concerning for DIC, consumptive coagulopathy, or hemolysis.
   As above, would also consider Parvo B19 on the differential although
   this does not explain hypoxia.
   - Trend counts
   - Check hemolysis labs
   - Iron studies
   - Call PCP in AM to determine baseline hematocrit and platelet as well
   as past hemoglobin electrophoresis.
   - Consider hemoglobin electrophoresis given family history of
   thalassemia
   .
   # HA: LP negative for bacterial or viral meningitis.
   - Acetaminophen prn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 20-year-old previously healthy female admitted to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions are as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) with a concern for an infectious process. Given the fever, bandemia (low platelet count), tachycardia, and abnormal laboratory findings, there is a high risk of sepsis. Immediate interventions should focus on identifying the source of infection and initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Thrombophlebitis: The patient may be at risk for thrombophlebitis, especially considering the history of pharyngitis and the presence of pulmonary nodules that could represent septic emboli or developing cavitary lesions. Monitoring for signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and considering a bedside ultrasound to assess for IJ thrombus are recommended.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, which indicates respiratory dysfunction. The abnormal CTA chest showing scattered ground glass opacities and pulmonary nodules raises concerns for septic emboli, bacterial pneumonia, or atypical pneumonia including Legionella. Negative pressure isolation and coverage for CAP and atypical pneumonia should be initiated. Close monitoring of oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female admitted to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever. She meets criteria for sepsis and is being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The presumptive diagnosis is Lemierre syndrome, given her history of severe sore throat and neck pain followed by hypoxia, along with the CT chest showing septic emboli in the setting of growing anaerobic GNRs at the OSH. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets criteria for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Lemierre syndrome: This is a rare complication of oropharyngeal infections, where septic emboli from the internal jugular vein can cause lung infections and other systemic manifestations. It can lead to further respiratory distress, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: The patient's labs do not indicate hemolysis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but there is suspicion for thalassemia. Further"

   received over 20L IVF in the first 24 hours and now sats are responding
   well to small doses of lasix PRN. Ongoing low grade fevers not
   surprising as most fevers resolve 8-12 days into this infection.
   Presumptive diagnosis is Lemierre
s given the h/o severe sore throat
   and neck pain followed by hypoxia as well as the CT chest c/w septic
   emboli in setting of growing anaerobic GNRs at the OSH. Lactate stable
   at 1.5, diff shows 80% polys without bands.

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old female admitted to the MICU for hypoxia, tachycardia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and fever. The patient has received over 20L IVF in the first 24 hours and is responding well to small doses of lasix PRN. The ongoing low-grade fevers are not surprising as most fevers resolve 8-12 days into this infection. The presumptive diagnosis is Lemierre's syndrome given the history of severe sore throat and neck pain followed by hypoxia, along with the CT chest showing septic emboli in the setting of growing anaerobic GNRs (Fusobacterium) at the OSH.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets criteria for sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is a low platelet count. This can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which means a decrease in the number of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. This can lead to fatigue and weakness.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient may have a coagulation disorder, which affects the blood's ability to clot properly. This can increase"
