         Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or
         Lactobacillus sp.
   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 58 yo woman with h/o DM1, CAD s/p CABG, recent R SFA
   stent/angioplasty, who presented with fevers to 105 and AMS and was
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension and AG acidosis.
   # Sepsis:  The patient presented with fever to 105 and was found to
   have GNRs ([**Location (un) **], official records pnd) and GPC ([**Hospital1 **])  in her blood.
   On vanc/zosyn. WBCs trending down and afebrile overnight. U/A was
   grossly positive for infection. UCx PND. Peritoneal fluid w 26 PMNs.
   DDx includes likely urosepsis (GPC) v. LE (recent procedure) v GI
   (mesenteric ischemia and stricture) vs hepatic abscess.
    - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
    - F/U blood cultures at [**Location (un) **] and at [**Hospital1 54**]
    - TTE once patient is stable
    - t/b with renal re contrast and consider CT abdomen/pelvis. Alt RUQ
   US  ? hepatic abscess
    - CT LE r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10095**] pocket, although GPC from urine are most likely
   source
   # Elevated INR:  Likely warfarin +abx vs hepatic failure. Ouzing
   through CVL.  FFP total, INR trending down.
    - Hold Coumadin.
   - DDAVP in the setting of uremic platelets /aspirin
   # Elevated troponin: The patient has a history of CAD, s/p CABG.  Her
   troponin has increased from 0.14 to 0.31 since admission, and her CK-MB
   is 10.  Her ECG demonstrated ST depressions in V5 and V6 but these
   appear unchanged vs prior. Ddx NSTEMI vs demand ischemia vs renal
   failure. CP free currently.
    - Cardiology C/S
    - given active ouzing and CP free status would hold on heparin for
   now.
    - HCT>30;
    - Continue [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], Plavix, Statin; if more significant bleeding occurs,
   if unstable secondarty to bleeding will hold [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/plavix
    - restart low dose bb as BP tolerates (dose given overnight)
   # Transaminitis: Dx shock liver vs hepatitis vs [**Male First Name (un) **] Chiari vs
   medication vs infection
   - RUQ Doppler u/s
   - consider CT
   - autoimmune and infective hepatitis w/u
   # Respiratory distress: Desat to low 90s with rising O2 req overnight.
   Also wheezing at the time. Concern for PEdema but CXR with only mild r
   hilar fullness. Improved with noninvasive.
   - continue PD (net neg 500cc)
   - would try NC if pt tolerates.
   - nebs prn
   # ESRD: Patient has ESRD on peritoneal HD, secondary to diabetic
   nephropathy.  She last had HD on [**2200-8-3**].  Nephrology has been
   consulted, and they are planning on doing manual exchanges while in the
   hospital.
    - PD q6hrs; f/u renal re HD
    - Renally dose medications
   # UTI: Patient reports new onset of foul smelling uring in the setting
   leukocytosis, positive U/A and fevers.
   - Continue ABX
   # Bilateral leg pain:  The patient recently underwent stent of R SFA,
   which raised concern of compartment syndrome. This is less likely
   because of bilateral nature of paina and positive CK-MB fraction.
   Vascular surgery doest think compartment syndrome is likely.
    - Continue pain control with morphine prn
    - Continue home gabapentin
    - f/u Vascular surgery recs
    - Continue IVFs as tolerated
   # DM1: Insulin gtt overnight, but became hypoglycemic. Transitioned to
   ISS
    - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
    - ISS and close monitor
    - low threshold for restarting ggt
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   # Anemia: Chronic. Likely [**1-13**] CRI. No signs of active bleeding.
    - continue Epogen qSaturday
    - guaiac stools
    - continue to trend
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / diabetic/cardiac diet
   # PPX: PPI, coumadin, bowel regimen prn, fall precautions

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent right superficial femoral artery (SFA) stent/angioplasty. She presented with fevers to 105 degrees Fahrenheit and altered mental status (AMS) and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension and acidosis.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a positive blood culture for gram-negative bacteria (GNRs) and gram-positive cocci (GPC). She is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Her white blood cell count is trending down, and she is afebrile overnight.
2. Elevated INR: The patient has an elevated international normalized ratio (INR), likely due to warfarin and antibiotic use. She is receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and her INR is trending down.
3. Elevated troponin: The patient has a history of CAD and recent CABG surgery. Her troponin levels have increased since admission, and her CK-MB is elevated. There are ST depressions in leads V5 and V6 on her ECG, but they appear unchanged from prior. Differential diagnosis includes non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), demand ischemia, or renal failure.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has"

   stent/angioplasty, who presented with fevers to 105 and AMS and was
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension and AG acidosis.
   # Sepsis:  The patient presented with fever to 105 and was found to
   have GNRs ([**Location (un) **], official records pnd) and GPC ([**Hospital1 **])  in her blood.
   On vanc/zosyn. WBCs trending down and afebrile overnight. U/A was
   grossly positive for infection. UCx PND. Peritoneal fluid w 26 PMNs.
   DDx includes likely urosepsis (GPC) v. LE (recent procedure) v GI
   (mesenteric ischemia and stricture) vs hepatic abscess.
    - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
    - F/U blood cultures at [**Location (un) **] and at [**Hospital1 54**]
    - TTE once patient is stable
    - CT abdomen/pelvis or RUQ US  ? hepatic abscess
   - CT LE r/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10095**] pocket, although GPC from urine are most likely source
   # Elevated INR:  Likely warfarin +abx vs hepatic failure. Ouzing
   through CVL.  FFP total, INR trending down.
    - Hold Coumadin.
   # Elevated troponin: The patient has a history of CAD, s/p CABG.  Her
   troponin has increased from 0.14 to 0.31 since admission, and her CK-MB
   is 10.  Her ECG demonstrated ST depressions in V5 and V6 but these
   appear unchanged vs prior. Ddx NSTEMI vs demand ischemia vs renal
   failure. CP free currently.
    - Cardiology C/S
    - ASA 325 mg
   - given active bleeding and CP free status would hold on heparin for
   now.
    - HCT>30
    - Continue Plavix, Statin
    - restart low dose bb as BP tolerates (dose given overnight)
   # Transaminitis: Dx shock liver vs hepatitis vs [**Male First Name (un) **] Chiari vs
   medication vs infection
   - RUQ Doppler u/s
   - consider CT
   - autoimmune and infective hepatitis w/u
   # Respiratory distress: Desat to low 90s with rising O2 req overnight.
   Also wheezing at the time. Concern for PEdema but CXR with only mild r
   hilar fullness. Improved with noninvasive.
   - continue PD (net neg 500cc)
   - would try NC if pt tolerates.
   - nebs prn
   # ESRD: Patient has ESRD on peritoneal HD, secondary to diabetic
   nephropathy.  She last had HD on [**2200-8-3**].  Nephrology has been
   consulted, and they are planning on doing manual exchanges while in the
   hospital.
    - PD q6hrs; f/u renal re HD
    - Renally dose medications
   # UTI: Patient reports new onset of foul smelling uring in the setting
   leukocytosis, positive U/A and fevers.
   - Continue ABX
   # Bilateral leg pain:  The patient recently underwent stent of R SFA,
   which raised concern of compartment syndrome. This is less likely
   because of bilateral nature of paina and positive CK-MB fraction.
   Vascular surgery doest think compartment syndrome is likely.
    - Continue pain control with morphine prn
    - Continue home gabapentin
    - f/u Vascular surgery recs
    - Continue IVFs as tolerated
   # DM1: Complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy,
   gastroparesis. Insulin ggt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs. Insulin gtt overnight, but
   became hypoglycemic. Transitioned to ISS
    - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
    - ISS and close monitor
   - low threshold for restarting ggt
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   # Anemia: Chronic. Likely [**1-13**] CRI. No signs of active bleeding.
    - continue Epogen qSaturday
    - guaiac stools

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and previous CABG surgery. She presented with fever, altered mental status, and hypotension, indicating sepsis. Blood cultures showed GNRs and GPC, leading to the initiation of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's WBC count is decreasing, and she is afebrile overnight.
- The patient has elevated troponin levels, a history of CAD, and previous CABG surgery. Her troponin has increased since admission, and her CK-MB is elevated. ECG showed ST depressions in V5 and V6. Ddx includes NSTEMI, demand ischemia, and renal failure.
- The patient's INR is elevated, likely due to warfarin and antibiotics. She is bleeding from the CVL site, and FFP was given with an improving trend in INR.
- The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating transaminitis. Differential diagnoses include shock liver, hepatitis, Chiari malformation, medication-induced liver injury, or infection.
- The patient experienced respiratory distress, with desaturation to the low 90s and wheezing. She required noninvasive ventilation.
- The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis secondary to diabetic nephropathy. She last had"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) stent/angioplasty. She presented with fevers to 105 degrees Fahrenheit and altered mental status (AMS) and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with hypotension and acidosis.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has an infection in her blood with gram-negative rods (GNRs) and gram-positive cocci (GPC). She is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. White blood cell count is trending down, and she is afebrile overnight. Urinalysis is positive for infection, and peritoneal fluid has 26 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Differential diagnosis includes urosepsis, lower extremity infection, gastrointestinal infection, or hepatic abscess.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presents with polymicrobial bacteremia and hypotension, along with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

During the 24-hour period, the patient experienced the following events: multi-lumen line placement, non-invasive ventilation initiation, and intermittent nausea. 

The patient's allergies include Reglan (metoclopramide Hcl), Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), labetalol, Norvasc (amlodipine besylate), vertigo, codeine, Zocor (simvastatin), and muscle/joint pain. 

The patient received antibiotics, including piperacillin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She was also administered dextrose 50%, morphine sulfate, metoprolol, and other ICU medications. 

The patient's review of systems revealed fatigue, fever, cough, hyperglycemia, and intermittent nausea. Physical examination showed no signs of abuse, pain, or delirium. 

Vital signs included a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/52 mmHg to 171/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. Blood glucose levels were significantly elevated. Other lab results indicated elevated liver enzymes, kidney function abnormalities, and electrolyte imbalances. 

Imaging studies included a chest X-ray, but no leg CT or abdominal imaging has been performed yet. 

The assessment and plan include the following: coagulopathy, renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and a history of diabetes mellitus type 1. 

Possible complications and further work-up include positive UK (unclear), unclear source of infection, abdominal CT, leg CT, obtaining records from another location, abdominal ultrasound, and follow-up cultures. 

NSTEMI requires attention, including follow-up TTE, trending troponins, follow-up EKG, and continuing Plavix and discussing with cardiology. 

Elevated transaminases will be evaluated with an abdominal ultrasound, and there is a high suspicion of shock liver. Respiratory issues may be related to fluid overload, and discussion with renal strategies to get fluid out is needed. 

For diabetes management, RISS and further discussion with a specialist are planned. 

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. 

The patient's current condition is critical, and she will remain in the ICU until an aggressive work-up for infection is completed."

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type I, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presents with polymicrobial bacteremia and hypotension, along with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple episodes of hypotension, respiratory distress, and nausea. She has been on non-invasive ventilation and later transitioned to bipap due to ongoing respiratory distress. 

The patient's vital signs have shown fever with a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. Her heart rate has been within normal limits, ranging from 67-93 beats per minute. Blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings between 109/38 mmHg and 171/75 mmHg. Respiratory rate has been stable, ranging from 12-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation has been maintained at 95%. Central venous pressure (CVP) has been within normal range at 19 mmHg. 

Fluid balance has shown an intake of 1,454-1,616 mL and output of 65-3,493 mL over the 24-hour period. Urine output has been low at 65-7 mL. The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics (piperacillin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam), as well as other ICU medications such"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10087**] is a 58 yo woman with h/o DM1, CAD s/p CABG, recent R SFA
   stent/angioplasty, who presented with fevers to 105 and AMS and was
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension and AG acidosis.
   # Sepsis:  The patient presented with fever to 105 and was found to
   have klebsiella ([**Location (un) **], official records pnd) and VRE ([**Hospital1 **])  in her
   blood.   On linezolid/zosyn, previously on vancomycin.  Also has alpha
   streptococcus or  Lactobacillus sp. in urine cx.  Peritoneal fluid w 26
   PMNs. CT abdomen showed multiple liver abscesses.  DDx includes likely
   liver abscesses v. (GPC) v. LE (recent procedure) vs hepatic abscess.
   No  e/o mesenteric ischemia on abd CT.  ID was consulted today.
    - F/U ID recs
    - Continue linezolid/Zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
    - not requiring pressors at this time
   - sending surveillance blood cx today
    - may need drainage of abscesses in liver
    - f/u final CT read
   # NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD, s/p CABG.  Her troponin has
   increased from 0.14 to 0.31 since admission, and her CK-MB is 10.  Her
   ECG demonstrated ST depressions in V5 and V6 but these appear unchanged
   vs prior.  Likely demand ischemia vs ACS vs vs renal failure. Pt had CP
   overnight, ECG grossly unchanged.
    - HCT>30
    - Continue asa, Plavix, Statin; if more significant bleeding occurs,
   if unstable secondarty to bleeding will hold asa/plavix
    - restarted low dose bb as BP tolerates
   # Respiratory distress: Desat to low 90s with rising O2 req, likely
   secondary to pulm edema from volume overload.  Low suspicion for pna at
   this time.
   - continue PD but will discuss with renal regarding increasing fluid
   removal
   - would try NC if pt tolerates.
   - nebs prn
   - Repeat CXR tomorrow.
   - Continue Linezolid/Zosyn
   # Elevated INR:  On warfarin at home for report of UE DVT.  Likely
   warfarin +abx vs hepatic failure. Oozing through CVL.  FFP total, INR
   trending down.
    - Hold Coumadin
    - DDAVP if needed in the setting of uremic platelets /aspirin
    - would not give vitamin K at this time given NSTEMI
   # Transaminitis: Likely [**1-13**] hepatic abscesses but may also be related
   to shock liver vs hepatitis vs [**Male First Name (un) **] Chiari vs medication
   - antibx, ID consult for hepatic abscesses
   - will send [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and anti-SM Ab, though low suspicion
   - Hold off on Hepatitis serologies, as patient was negative in [**Month (only) 1033**]
   - Decrease Crestor dose to 10 mg daily for renal dosing
   # ESRD: Patient has ESRD on peritoneal HD, secondary to diabetic
   nephropathy.  She last had HD on [**2200-8-3**].  Nephrology has been
   consulted, and they are planning on doing manual exchanges while in the
   hospital.
    - PD vs HD, will discuss with renal
    - Renally dose medications
   # UTI: Patient reports new onset of foul smelling uring in the setting
   leukocytosis, positive U/A and fevers.
   - Continue ABX
   # Bilateral leg pain:  The patient recently underwent stent of R SFA,
   which raised concern of compartment syndrome. This is less likely
   because of bilateral nature of pain and positive CK-MB fraction.
   Vascular surgery does not think compartment syndrome is likely and LE
   CT is neg by prelim.  DDx also includes rhabdo [**1-13**] Crestor use given
   elevated LFTs and CK
    - Decrease Crestor to 10 mg daily

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [**Known lastname 10087**] is a 58-year-old woman with a history of DM1, CAD s/p CABG, and recent right SFA stent/angioplasty. She presented with fevers to 105 and altered mental status and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension and acidosis.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including sepsis due to klebsiella and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in her blood. She also has liver abscesses, which may require drainage. Additionally, she has a history of NSTEMI, respiratory distress possibly secondary to pulmonary edema, elevated INR likely due to warfarin and antibiotics, transaminitis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis, urinary tract infection (UTI), bilateral leg pain, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent findings suggest an ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Liver Abscesses: The presence of multiple liver abscesses increases the risk of liver failure, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and multiorgan dysfunction.

3. NSTEMI: The patient's"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 10087**] is a 58 yo woman with h/o DM1, CAD s/p CABG, recent R SFA
   stent/angioplasty, who presented with fevers to 105 and AMS and was
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension and AG acidosis.
   # Sepsis:  The patient presented with fever to 105 and was found to
   have klebsiella ([**Location (un) **], official records pnd) and VRE ([**Hospital1 **])  in her
   blood.   On linezolid/zosyn, previously on vancomycin.  Also has alpha
   streptococcus or  Lactobacillus sp. in urine cx.  Peritoneal fluid w 26
   PMNs. DDx includes likely urosepsis (GPC) v. LE (recent procedure) vs
   hepatic abscess.  No  e/o mesenteric ischemia on abd CT.
    - Continue linezolid/Zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
    - not requiring pressors at this time
    - ID consult given ?abscesses in liver
    - sending surveillance blood cx today
    - may need drainage of abscesses in liver
    - f/u final CT read
   # NSTEMI: The patient has a history of CAD, s/p CABG.  Her troponin has
   increased from 0.14 to 0.31 since admission, and her CK-MB is 10.  Her
   ECG demonstrated ST depressions in V5 and V6 but these appear unchanged
   vs prior.  Likely demand ischemia vs ACS vs vs renal failure. CP free
   currently.
    - given oozing from IJ and CP free status would hold on heparin for
   now.
    - HCT>30
    - Continue asa, Plavix, Statin; if more significant bleeding occurs,
   if unstable secondarty to bleeding will hold asa/plavix
    - restarted low dose bb as BP tolerates
   # Elevated INR:  On warfarin at home for report of UE DVT.  Likely
   warfarin +abx vs hepatic failure. Oozing through CVL.  FFP total, INR
   trending down.
    - Hold Coumadin
    - DDAVP if needed in the setting of uremic platelets /aspirin
    - would not give vitamin K at this time given NSTEMI
   # Transaminitis: Likely [**1-13**] hepatic abscesses but may also be related
   to shock liver vs hepatitis vs [**Male First Name (un) **] Chiari vs medication
   - antibx, ID consult for hepatic abscesses
   - will send hepatitis serologies and [**Doctor First Name 1205**] though low suspicion
   # Respiratory distress: Desat to low 90s with rising O2 req, likely
   secondary to pulm edema from volume overload.  No suspicion for pna at
   this time.
   - continue PD but will discuss with renal regarding increasing fluid
   removal
   - would try NC if pt tolerates.
   - nebs prn
   # ESRD: Patient has ESRD on peritoneal HD, secondary to diabetic
   nephropathy.  She last had HD on [**2200-8-3**].  Nephrology has been
   consulted, and they are planning on doing manual exchanges while in the
   hospital.
    - PD vs HD, will discuss with renal
    - Renally dose medications
   # UTI: Patient reports new onset of foul smelling uring in the setting
   leukocytosis, positive U/A and fevers.
   - Continue ABX
   # Bilateral leg pain:  The patient recently underwent stent of R SFA,
   which raised concern of compartment syndrome. This is less likely
   because of bilateral nature of paina and positive CK-MB fraction.
   Vascular surgery does not think compartment syndrome is likely and LE
   CT is neg by prelim.
    - Continue pain control with morphine prn
    - f/u final CT read
    - Continue home gabapentin
    - f/u Vascular surgery recs

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presented with hypotension and polymicrobial bacteremia, including pan-sensitive klebsiella and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), with an unclear source. The abdominal CT scan revealed ground glass opacities at the bases bilaterally, which could represent aspiration or infection. There was also a small left pleural effusion and moderate intra-abdominal ascites. An irregular-shaped low-density lesion in segment II of the liver measuring 1.6 x 2.6 was concerning for an abscess. Additional hypodensities in segments represented abscesses versus cysts. The patient's peripheral arteries were patent to the level of the popliteals. No soft tissue gas or fluid collections were identified. The chest X-ray showed right lower lobe opacity and left lower lobe opacity, both new from yesterday. 

The patient's assessment includes coagulopathy, renal failure (end-stage), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and a history of diabetes mellitus type I. The plan includes continuing peritoneal dialysis, monitoring for signs of infection, and managing acute coronary syndrome medically with aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and maintaining anticoagulation with warfarin. The ICU care includes cardiac diabetic diet,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10087**] is a 58 yo woman with h/o DM1, CAD s/p CABG, recent R SFA
   stent/angioplasty, who presented with fevers to 105 and AMS and was
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension and AG acidosis.
   # Sepsis:  Klebsiella ([**Location (un) **], official records pnd) and VRE ([**Hospital1 **])  in
   her blood.   On linezolid/zosyn.  Also has alpha streptococcus or
   Lactobacillus sp. in urine cx.  Peritoneal fluid w 26 PMNs. CT abdomen
   showed multiple liver abscesses.  DDx includes likely liver abscesses
   v. (GPC) v. LE (recent procedure) vs dislocation of stent.  No e/o
   mesenteric ischemia on abd CT.  ID was consulted today.
    - F/U ID recs
    - f/u ERCP recs
    - Continue linezolid/Zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
    - may need drainage of abscesses in liver
    - f/u final CT read
   # Troponin rise: The patient has a history of CAD, s/p CABG.  Troponin
   rise on this admission.  Her ECG demonstrated ST depressions in V5 and
   V6 but these appear unchanged vs prior.  Likely demand ischemia vs ACS
   vs renal failure. Pt had CP overnight, ECG grossly unchanged.  CP free.
    - HCT>30
    - Continue asa, Plavix, Statin; if more significant bleeding occurs,
   if unstable secondarty to bleeding will hold asa/plavix
    - restarted low dose bb as BP tolerates
   - c/s cards if ERCP rec d.c plavix /asa
   # Respiratory distress: Desat to low 90s with rising O2 req, likely
   secondary to pulm edema from volume overload.  Low suspicion for pna at
   this time.
   - continue PD but will discuss with renal regarding increasing fluid
   removal
   - would try NC if pt tolerates.
   - nebs prn
   - Repeat CXR tomorrow.
   - Continue Linezolid/Zosyn
   # Elevated INR:  On warfarin at home for report of UE DVT.  Likely
   warfarin +abx vs hepatic failure.
    - Hold Coumadin
    - DDAVP if needed in the setting of uremic platelets /aspirin
   # Transaminitis: Likely [**1-13**] hepatic abscesses but may also be related
   to shock liver vs hepatitis vs cholestasis/dislocated stent
   - antibx, ID consult for hepatic abscesses
   - will send [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and anti-SM Ab, though low suspicion
   - Hold off on Hepatitis serologies, as patient was negative in [**Month (only) 1033**]
   - Decrease Crestor dose to 10 mg daily for renal dosing
   # ESRD: Patient has ESRD on peritoneal HD, secondary to diabetic
   nephropathy.  She last had HD on [**2200-8-3**].  Nephrology has been
   consulted, and they are planning on doing manual exchanges while in the
   hospital.
    - PD vs HD, will discuss with renal
    - Renally dose medications
   # UTI: GPC in urine. Specificity pnd.
   - Continue ABX
   # Bilateral leg pain:  The patient recently underwent stent of R SFA,
   which raised concern of compartment syndrome. This is less likely
   because of bilateral nature of pain and positive CK-MB fraction.
   Vascular surgery does not think compartment syndrome is likely and LE
   CT is neg by prelim.  DDx also includes rhabdo [**1-13**] Crestor use given
   elevated LFTs and CK
    - Continue pain control with morphine prn
    - f/u final CT read
    - Continue home gabapentin
    - f/u Vascular surgery recs
   # DM1: Insulin gtt overnight, as patient was hyperglycemic yesterday
    - F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
    - Insulin gtt and check FSBG q1h
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue home levothyroxine.
   # Anemia: Chronic. Likely [**1-13**] CRI. No signs of active bleeding.
    - continue Epogen qSaturday

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and recent right superficial femoral artery stent/angioplasty.
- She presented with fevers up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit and altered mental status, leading to her transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).
- The patient was found to have hypotension and acute kidney injury.
- She tested positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae in her blood culture, which is sensitive to multiple antibiotics but resistant to ampicillin.
- She also had vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in her blood and was switched from vancomycin to linezolid.
- Her urine culture showed alpha-streptococcus or Lactobacillus species, and her peritoneal fluid had 26 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs).
- A CT scan of her abdomen revealed multiple liver abscesses.
- The differential diagnosis includes liver abscesses versus gastrointestinal perforation versus biliary stent displacement.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). She had a rise in troponin levels, but her ECG showed no significant changes.
- She was given aspirin and Plavix, which were temporarily held due to bleeding concerns.
- The patient experienced respiratory distress and desaturated to the low 90s, likely"

   - Decrease Crestor dose to 10 mg daily for renal dosing
   # ESRD: Patient has ESRD on peritoneal HD, secondary to diabetic
   nephropathy.  She last had HD on [**2200-8-3**].  Nephrology has been
   consulted, and they are planning on doing manual exchanges while in the

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

- The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent right superficial femoral artery (SFA) stent/angioplasty.
- She presented with fevers up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit and altered mental status (AMS) and was transferred to the MICU with hypotension and acute kidney injury (AKI).
- The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis caused by Klebsiella and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in her blood. She is currently receiving linezolid and Zosyn for broad-spectrum coverage.
- Her urine culture showed alpha-streptococcus or Lactobacillus species, and peritoneal fluid analysis revealed 26 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs).
- A CT scan of her abdomen showed multiple liver abscesses, which may require drainage.
- The patient also has a history of CAD, and her troponin levels have risen on this admission. She demonstrated ST depressions in leads V5 and V6 on her ECG, suggesting possible ischemia.
- She experienced respiratory distress and desaturated to low 90s with rising oxygen requirements, likely secondary to pulmonary edema from fluid overload.
- Her INR is elevated, possibly"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of type I diabetes mellitus, who presented to the hospital with complaints of fever and was found to have Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia. She was initially treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. However, she developed resistance to ampicillin and her VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) in the blood led to a change in antibiotic therapy to linezolid. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), blood pressure ranging from 125/15mmHg to 158/138mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her weight is currently 87 kg.

The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells, CT abdomen showing ground glass opacities at the lung bases, small bilateral effusions, and multiple liver lesions which may be infected. She also had a displacement of an old biliary stent and underwent an ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) after a discussion with the attending physician.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of type I diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presents with hypotension and abdominal pain, and now has polymicrobial bacteremia and possible biliary obstruction. The patient has impaired balance, gait, knowledge, and transfers due to her critical condition. She also has coagulopathy, renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus (DM), type I, coronary artery disease (CAD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD). She has an unclear history of biliary intervention in the past, and the biliary stent is misplaced. The next logical step in her care is an Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure.

The patient requires continued antibiotic therapy, guided by the Infectious Disease team, as well as anti-platelet agents for her CAD and femoral stent. She is also receiving insulin therapy for her DM1, but with caution given her NPO (nothing by mouth) status.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is being kept NPO, receiving insulin infusion for glycemic control, and has multiple lines inserted. She is on systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a medical history of type I diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD). She presents with hypotension, abdominal pain, polymicrobial bacteremia, and possible biliary obstruction.

The patient has an unclear history of biliary intervention in the past, and the biliary stent appears to be misplaced based on the CT scan. ERCP is recommended as the next logical step in her care to address the biliary obstruction and possible liver abscess.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding during the ERCP procedure: The patient is currently on anti-platelet agents for her CAD and femoral stent. There is a risk of bleeding during the ERCP procedure, so FFP should be given prior to the procedure.

2. Infection: The patient already has polymicrobial bacteremia. It is important to continue antibiotics with guidance from the ID team to prevent further infections.

3. Hypoglycemia: The patient has type I diabetes mellitus (DM1) and is receiving insulin therapy. However, caution should be exercised given the patient's NPO status.

4. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD and is on PD. Care should be taken to monitor her renal function and adjust her dialysis regimen accordingly.

   58 yo F transferred from west ICU for ERCP.  Admitted on [**8-5**] with
   polymicrobial sepsis - klebsiella and VRE and transaminitis attributed
   to shock liver.  New hyperbilirubinemia today with worsening
   transaminitis and increased abdominal pain, concern for cholangitis.
   Also with mild SOB on transfer since resolved.
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: TBili acutely increased from 1--->4 this morning
   with worsening abd pain. Concern for cholangitis given rising WBC,
   though HD stable. CT showing displaced stent, and intrahepatic biliary
   duct dilation in addition to several areas concerning for abscess.
   - ERCP following, appreciate recs
   - continue linzeolid and zosyn
   - patient HD stable, plan for INR reversal (4.6 today) over weekend and
   ERCP on Monday.  If becomes hemodynamically unstable will need  ERCP
   more emergently
   - trend LFT's
   # Transaminitis:  Worsening now though had initially been improving.
   Transaminitis on presentation thought to be shock liver and were
   improving.  This morning they worsened in setting of elevated bili.
   Likely [**1-13**] cholangitis.
   - trend
   - ERCP as above
   #. Sepsis:  Resolving.  Presumed cause is biliary tract given
   polymicrobical culture of klebsiella and VRE.  BP's stable (running
   140-160's) over last 24 hours.
   - continue Linezolid and Zosyn
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - R IJ in place
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - MAP >65
   - bolus as needed
   # Elevated INR: INR 4.6 this morning after initially falling from peak
   of 6.7.  Unclear cause, likely [**1-13**] antibiotic use, poor po intake.  Per
   ERCP, ideally will be 1.5 though would tolerate 1.9 for procedure.
   - per hospital INR guidelines, reversal of level of 4.6 involves
   holding doses.  However, patient goign for semi-urgent procedure so
   will be more aggressive in reversing and give vitamin K 4mg po.
   - trend INR - if elevated tomorrow, consider additional po vitamin K,
   no role for IV or sq in this setting
   # Shortness of Breath: Reported on transfer, but since resolved. Likely
   multifactorial - mild volume o/l, splinting [**1-13**] pain, GGOs on CT.
   Sating well on RA.

   # Peripheral Vascular Disease:  S/p R SFA stent placement and
   angioplasty and R SFA-AK [**Doctor Last Name 114**] angioplasty earlier this month.  Leg pain
   at baseline now.  There was initial concern for compartment syndrome
   with elevated CK, but pt with demand ischemia, CK elevation not
   attributed to skeletal muscle source.  Vascular following, appreciate

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, who was admitted on [**8-5**] with polymicrobial sepsis caused by klebsiella and VRE, along with transaminitis attributed to shock liver. The patient has been experiencing worsening abdominal pain and hyperbilirubinemia, leading to concerns of cholangitis. A CT scan showed displaced stent, intrahepatic biliary duct dilation, and areas concerning for abscess. The patient's white blood cell count is rising, indicating ongoing infection.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's bilirubin levels have acutely increased from 1 to 4 this morning, along with worsening abdominal pain. This could be indicative of cholangitis, especially considering the CT findings of a displaced stent and intrahepatic biliary duct dilation.

2. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are worsening, initially thought to be shock liver but now likely secondary to cholangitis.

3. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis is resolving, the presumed cause is still the biliary tract, as evidenced by polymicrobial cultures including klebsiella and VRE.

4. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is 4.6 this morning, after initially falling from a peak of 6.7. This high INR may be due to antibiotic use"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, coronary artery disease (CAD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD). She presents with hypotension and abdominal pain and has been diagnosed with polymicrobial sepsis, cholangitis, and possible biliary obstruction.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 130/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's peripheral pulses are diminished on both upper and lower extremities.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Liver enzymes such as ALT and AST are also elevated. Other lab values show abnormalities in electrolytes, renal function, and coagulation profile.

The patient has impaired balance, gait, knowledge, and transfers due to her critical condition. She has a history of diabetes mellitus type I and CAD, and she is on PD for ESRD. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics, vitamin K for elevated INR, insulin therapy, and anti-platelet agents.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female admitted to the ICU with polymicrobial sepsis, including klebsiella and VRE, and transaminitis attributed to shock liver. She developed new hyperbilirubinemia with worsening transaminitis and increased abdominal pain, raising concerns for cholangitis. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to DM, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with polymicrobial sepsis, and although her condition is currently resolving, there is still a risk of further infection due to the presence of klebsiella and VRE.
2. Cholangitis: The patient's symptoms suggest worsening transaminitis and increased abdominal pain, which could be indicative of cholangitis. This condition requires prompt management to prevent complications.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver enzymes, indicating potential liver dysfunction. Close monitoring of liver function is necessary.
4. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient has a history of demand ischemia with elevated troponin levels and may be at risk for further cardiac complications. Continuous monitoring of cardiac status is essential.
5. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has a history of R SFA stent placement and angioplasty. There is a risk of re-occlusion or further complications related to"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo F transferred from west ICU for ERCP.  Admitted on [**8-5**] with
   polymicrobial sepsis - klebsiella and VRE and transaminitis attributed
   to shock liver.  New hyperbilirubinemia today with worsening
   transaminitis and increased abdominal pain, concern for cholangitis.
   Also with mild SOB on transfer since resolved.
   .
   #. Sepsis:  Resolving.  Presumed cause is biliary tract given
   polymicrobical culture of klebsiella and VRE.  BP's stable (running
   140-160's) over last 24 hours.
   - continue Linezolid and Zosyn
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - MAP >65
   - bolus as needed
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia: TBili acutely increased from 1--->4 this morning
   with worsening abd pain. Concern for cholangitis given rising WBC,
   though HD stable. CT showing displaced stent, and intrahepatic biliary
   duct dilation in addition to several areas concerning for abscess.
   - ERCP following, appreciate recs
   - continue linzeolid and zosyn
   - patient HD stable, plan for INR reversal (4.6 on ICU transfer) over
   weekend and ERCP on Monday.  If becomes hemodynamically unstable will
   need  ERCP more emergently
   - trend LFT's
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Worsening now though had initially been improving.
   Transaminitis on presentation thought to be shock liver and were
   improving.  This morning they worsened in setting of elevated bili.
   Likely [**1-13**] cholangitis.
   - trend
   - ERCP as above
   - serial abdominal exams
      .
   # Elevated INR: INR 3.2 this morning after 4 mg vitamin K yesterday.
   Unclear cause of elevated INR, likely [**1-13**] antibiotic use, poor po
   intake.  Per ERCP, ideally will be 1.5 though would tolerate 1.9 for
   procedure.
   - Check PM INR, give Vitamin K if still elevated
   - plan for ERCP on Monday
   # Demand Ischemia:  Noted to have elevated troponin on admission - was
   at baseline of 0/14 per opt pt cards.  Continued to rise to 0.74 on

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 58-year-old female with multiple medical complications. She was admitted on [8-5] with polymicrobial sepsis caused by klebsiella and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), as well as transaminitis attributed to shock liver. The patient's condition has been worsening, with new hyperbilirubinemia and increased abdominal pain, raising concerns for cholangitis. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure range of 140-160 mmHg and a heart rate of 89 bpm. However, there are several potential medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is resolving, but she still requires continued Linezolid and Zosyn antibiotics. It is important to maintain urine output (UOP) greater than 30 cc/hr, mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and provide fluid boluses as needed.

2. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's total bilirubin level has acutely increased from 1 to 4 mg/dL this morning, along with worsening abdominal pain. This raises concern for cholangitis, especially with the presence of intrahepatic biliary duct dilation seen on CT scan. An ERCP procedure is planned for Monday to address this issue.

3. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminase levels have worsened, initially thought to be shock liver. However"

   The etiology of bacteremia/leukocytosis is likely biliary obstruction
   with evidence of possible liver abscess vs large biliary ducts/bile
   pooling seen on CT abd. Patient has an unclear history of prior biliary
   intervention (placed at OSH several yrs prior, ? [**2185**]) and the biliary
   stent appears to be misplaced by CT read.
   Supratherpautic INR has corrected w/ vit K with plan for ERCP tomorrow.
   We continue antibiotics, with guidance from ID team given her
   polymicrobial bacteremia. Her WBC count isrising slowly, though she
   remains af and lfts slowlydecreasing.  Will send differential and check
   stool for c diff . F/u pending cx data and recx if spikes. Continue to
   monitor LFTs and follow serial abd exams.  Pending ERCP, will consider
   further intervention with possible IR-guided drainage of ? liver
   abscess.
   Coagulopathy/supratherapurtic INR in the setting of coumadin and
   antibxs. Now normalized with vit K.
   For PVD and femoral stent, we will continue anti-platelet agents,
   though there is a risk of bleeding during the ERCP procedure. Clarify
   with vascular surgery. Monitor closely for post-procedure bleeding.
   Keep t and c active.
   She continues on PD for esrd.  Given neg fluid balance, renal plans to
   adjust PD dialysate accordingly.
   Continue insulin therapy given DM1, though need to be cautious given
   NPO status.  [**Last Name (un) 276**] team is following.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presents with hypotension and abdominal pain and has been found to have polymicrobial bacteremia (Klebsiella and VRE) and possible biliary obstruction with evidence of a liver abscess.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Polymicrobial bacteremia: The patient has an infection caused by multiple types of bacteria, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.

2. Biliary obstruction: The patient's biliary system may be blocked, potentially leading to further complications such as cholangitis or liver abscess.

3. Liver abscess: There is a possibility of a liver abscess due to the biliary obstruction and polymicrobial bacteremia. This can cause severe abdominal pain and systemic illness.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an immune response to infection or inflammation.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a supratherapeutic INR (International Normalized Ratio), indicating impaired blood clotting. This can increase the risk of bleeding, especially during invasive procedures.

6. Femoral stent and peripheral vascular disease (PVD): The patient has a femoral stent and PVD, requiring anti-platelet agents to prevent clot formation."

   2. Given abnormal common bile duct stent position in combination with
   intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, the large ill-defined and
   irregular
   left hepatic hypodensity is felt to represent an abscess secondary to
   ascending cholangitis. At this time, an ERCP is recommended with stent
   replacement. If patient does not improve clinically, repeat imaging can
   be
   obtained in 48 hours and eventually percutaneous aspiration can be
   considered.
   3. Calcified bladder wall.
   4. Patent lower extremity vessels and right SFA stent graft with
   multifocal
   areas of narrowing involving the left popliteal and trifurcation
   vessels as

   and
   noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque.
   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo F transferred from west ICU for ERCP.  Admitted on [**8-5**] with
   polymicrobial sepsis - klebsiella and VRE and transaminitis attributed
   to shock liver. She developed new hyperbilirubinemia with worsening
   transaminitis and increased abdominal pain, concern for cholangitis.
   .
   #. Sepsis:  Resolving. Pt now afebrile with nl HR. WBC stable and BP's
   stable (110s-150s) over last 24 hours.  Presumed cause is biliary tract
   given polymicrobical culture of klebsiella and VRE.  T bili now stable
   and pt feels slightly improved. CT showing displaced stent, and
   intrahepatic biliary duct dilation in addition to several areas
   concerning for abscess. Transaminitis on presentation thought to be due
   to shock liver or due to cholangitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female admitted on [**8-5**] with polymicrobial sepsis, including Klebsiella and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and transaminitis attributed to shock liver. She developed new hyperbilirubinemia, worsening transaminitis, and increased abdominal pain, raising concern for cholangitis. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) with complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and gastroparesis. She also has hypothyroidism, anemia, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with recent stent placement in the right superficial femoral artery (SFA). The patient is currently on peritoneal dialysis due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to DM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current sepsis appears to be resolving, but there is still a concern for potential recurrence, especially given the polymicrobial nature of the infection.
2. Cholangitis: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest cholangitis. An ERCP procedure is planned to address this issue.
3. Abscess: The CT scan shows multiple areas concerning for abscesses. If these abscesses progress or become infected, they may require drainage or further intervention.
4. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia indicate possible"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease, demand ischemia, and hypothyroidism.
- She was admitted on [**8-5**] with polymicrobial sepsis due to bacteremia with Klebsiella and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), likely secondary to cholangitis seen on imaging.
- The patient's fever has resolved, and her blood pressure and white blood cell count are stable.
- A CT scan revealed a displaced biliary stent, intrahepatic biliary duct dilation, and multiple areas concerning for abscess.
- The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which included removing the old biliary stent, sludge/stone-like filling defect in the distal common bile duct, and placement of a new stent.
- Repeat ERCP with sphincterotomy is planned in 12 weeks once safely off Plavix for 7 days.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and the statin medication was held.
- Further evaluation and treatment for multiple abscesses are recommended by the Infectious Disease department.
- The patient will restart aspirin (ASA) 72 hours after the procedure.
- The patient's demand ischemia was felt to be due to elevated troponin levels on admission, and it"

   2. Given abnormal common bile duct stent position in combination with
   intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, the large ill-defined and
   irregular
   left hepatic hypodensity is felt to represent an abscess secondary to
   ascending cholangitis. At this time, an ERCP is recommended with stent
   replacement. If patient does not improve clinically, repeat imaging can
   be
   obtained in 48 hours and eventually percutaneous aspiration can be
   considered.
   3. Calcified bladder wall.

   multifocal
   areas of narrowing involving the left popliteal and trifurcation
   vessels as

   and
   noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque.
   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo F transferred from west ICU for ERCP.  Admitted on [**8-5**] with
   polymicrobial sepsis - klebsiella and VRE and transaminitis attributed
   to shock liver. She developed new hyperbilirubinemia with worsening
   transaminitis and increased abdominal pain, concern for cholangitis.
   .
   #. Sepsis:  Resolving. Pt now afebrile with nl HR. WBC stable and BP's
   stable (110s-150s) over last 24 hours.  Presumed cause is biliary tract
   given polymicrobical culture of klebsiella and VRE.  T bili now stable
   and pt feels slightly improved. CT showing displaced stent, and
   intrahepatic biliary duct dilation in addition to several areas
   concerning for abscess. Transaminitis on presentation thought to be due
   to shock liver or due to cholangitis.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications that require attention. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with polymicrobial sepsis caused by Klebsiella and VRE. However, the patient is now afebrile with stable vital signs and white blood cell count, indicating that the sepsis is resolving. The presumed cause of the sepsis is a biliary tract infection.

2. Cholangitis: The patient has worsening hyperbilirubinemia, transaminitis, and increased abdominal pain, which are concerning for cholangitis. Imaging shows a displaced stent, intrahepatic biliary duct dilation, and areas concerning for abscess. An ERCP is planned to address this issue.

3. Demand Ischemia: The patient had elevated troponin levels on admission, which continued to rise. This suggests ongoing demand ischemia, likely due to the body's demand for oxygenated blood during times of stress. The patient's ejection fraction was flat, and the EKG remained unchanged.

4. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has a history of right superficial femoral artery stent placement and angioplasty, as well as left popliteal and trifurcation vessel narrowing due to atherosclerotic plaque. Plavix will be continued given recent stent placement, and ASA will be held prior to ERCP.

5. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female admitted to the ICU for polymicrobial sepsis caused by Klebsiella and VRE, as well as transaminitis attributed to shock liver. She developed new hyperbilirubinemia with worsening transaminitis and increased abdominal pain, leading to a concern for cholangitis. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and gastroparesis. She also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to DM, and is on peritoneal dialysis. Additionally, the patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), for which she underwent right superficial femoral artery (SFA) stent placement and angioplasty, as well as right SFA-ankle bypass surgery. The patient also has anemia at baseline, likely chronic, and likely related to chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 134/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presents with sepsis, hypotension, and polymicrobial bacteremia. Possible biliary obstruction and liver abscess are also suspected. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, impaired gait, knowledge, transfers, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Polymicrobial bacteremia: The patient has an infection caused by multiple bacteria, including Klebsiella and VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus). This can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Biliary obstruction/cholangitis: The patient may have a blockage in her bile ducts, which can cause inflammation of the bile ducts (cholangitis). This can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
3. Liver abscess: There is a possibility of a liver abscess forming due to the suspected biliary obstruction. If not treated, it can lead to further complications and systemic infection.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a supratherapeutic INR (International Normalized Ratio), indicating impaired blood clotting. This increases the risk of bleeding, especially during procedures like ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography).
5. Femoral stent, PVD (peripheral vascular disease): The patient has"

   large biliary ducts/bile pooling seen on CT abd. Patient has an unclear
   history of prior biliary stent (placed at OSH several yrs prior, ?
   [**2185**]) which has migrated by CT read.
   Supratherpautic INR now corrected (vit K) with plan for ERCP today. We
   continue antibiotics for polymicrobial bacteremia. Her WBC count is
   rising slowly, lfts slightly increased, though she remains af.
   Additional infection w/u has been neg to date including c diff cxs,
   urine and f/u blood cxs. We continue to monitor LFTs and follow serial
   abd exams.  Pending ERCP, will consider reimaging to reassess for ?
   liver abscess with possible further intervention of IR-guided drainage

   Coagulopathy/supratherapurtic INR in the setting of coumadin and
   antibxs. Now normalized with vit K. On sq hep for DVT prophy until
   coumadin restarted and therapeutic.
   For PVD and femoral stent, we have continued her plavix, noting risk of
   bleeding during the ERCP procedure. ERCP is aware of this and are not
   planning to perform a sphincterotomy.  We will monitor closely for
   post-procedure bleeding and maintain an active t and c.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis, demand ischemia, peripheral vascular disease, hypothyroidism, and anemia. She was admitted to the ICU for an ERCP procedure due to suspected cholangitis and polymicrobial sepsis. The patient had an old biliary stent removed, a sludge/stone like filling defect in the distal common bile duct, and a new biliary stent placed. She also has several areas concerning for abscess on imaging. The patient's sepsis has resolved, but she remains at risk for complications such as infection and further biliary tract issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of polymicrobial sepsis and remains at risk for further infections, particularly due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines.
2. Biliary Tract Issues: The patient has a sludge/stone like filling defect in the distal common bile duct, which may lead to obstruction or further complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Abscesses: The patient's imaging shows several areas concerning for abscesses, which could potentially worsen or spread if not treated promptly.
4. Cardiovascular Events: The patient has a history of demand ischemia and peripheral vascular disease, placing her at risk for cardiovascular events such"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female admitted to the ICU for ERCP. She was transferred from another ICU due to polymicrobial sepsis caused by bacteremia with klebsiella and VRE, likely secondary to cholangitis. The patient had a previous cholecystectomy and was found to have a sludge/stone like filling defect in the distal common bile duct. An ERCP was performed, old biliary stent was removed, and a new stent was placed. The patient's condition improved, and she is now afebrile with stable vital signs. However, she still has intrahepatic biliary duct dilation and multiple areas concerning for abscesses. The patient's mental status has been altered, and there are several potential causes including infection, seizure, and hyperglycemia. She also has a history of demand ischemia, peripheral vascular disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), hypothyroidism, anemia, and seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of polymicrobial sepsis and is still at risk due to her altered mental status and presence of multiple abscesses.
2. Abscesses: The patient has multiple areas concerning for abscesses, which need to be addressed and treated appropriately.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been altered,"

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, peripheral vascular disease with recent stent placement, demand ischemia, hypothyroidism, anemia, and seizure disorder. She was admitted to the ICU with polymicrobial sepsis due to bacteremia with Klebsiella and VRE, likely secondary to biliary tract infection. She underwent an ERCP procedure on [**8-11**], where an old biliary stent was removed, and a new one was placed due to a sludge/stone-like defect in the distal common bile duct. The patient also has altered mental status, possibly due to infection, seizure, or hypoglycemia, as well as a history of compartment syndrome with elevated CK levels. She is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, blood thinners, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient had polymicrobial sepsis and is still at risk for developing further infections, especially with the presence of multiple indwelling lines and her compromised immune system.
2. Biliary complications: The patient has a history of cholangitis and a recent ERCP procedure, which increases the risk of biliary complications such as cholecystitis or pancreatitis.
3. Ischemia: The patient has a history of demand ischemia and peripheral vascular disease,"

   vs large biliary ducts/bile pooling seen on CT abd.
   Agree with plan to continue linezolid and zosyn for polymicrobial
   bacteremia. Her WBC count and lfts are improving post ercp with stent
   and she remains af.  Additional infection w/u has been neg to date
   including c diff cxs, PD cxs, urine and f/u blood cxs. We continue to
   monitor LFTs and follow serial abd exams.  Will plan to reimage her
   ruq in a few days to guide length of antibx course and need for further
   intervention such as IR-guided drainage procedure in regards to ? liver
   abscesses.
   Unclear etiology of increasing somnolence this am.  VSS and AF. No
   change in oxygenation.  Has known sz history, but no observed sz
   activity.  Will evaluate with abg to assess CO2.  Monitor closely in
   ICU for now pending improvement in MS.
   For PVD and femoral stent, she remains on plavix.  On sq hep for DVT
   prophy until INR therapeutic.  Coumadin has been restarted.  Hct
   remains stable post procuedre.
   Continues with PD for esrd, per renal.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis.
- She presented with sepsis and hypotension and was found to have polymicrobial bacteremia in the setting of biliary obstruction/cholangitis.
- A procedure called ERCP was performed, which involved removing an old stent, clearing sludge, and placing a new stent. However, no cholangiogram was done.
- The patient's white blood cell count and liver function tests are improving post-ERCP.
- Additional infection workup has been negative to date.
- The patient's somnolence is unclear in etiology and will be evaluated with VSS and ABG.
- She remains alert and awake.
- The patient has a history of seizures, but no observed seizure activity was noted.
- She is on Plavix for PVD and femoral stent, and also on Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis until INR becomes therapeutic.
- The patient continues with peritoneal dialysis for end-stage renal disease.
- She will continue insulin therapy due to diabetes mellitus type 1.
- Remainder of the plan outlined in the resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presented with sepsis and hypotension and was found to have polymicrobial bacteremia (Klebsiella and VRE) in the setting of biliary obstruction/cholangitis. There is also a possible liver abscess. The patient has several other medical issues including chronic anemia, impaired balance and gait, impaired knowledge, and impaired transfers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Polymicrobial bacteremia: The patient has an infection caused by multiple bacteria, which can lead to sepsis if not properly treated.
2. Biliary obstruction/cholangitis: The patient's biliary system is blocked, leading to inflammation and potential complications such as liver abscess.
3. Liver abscess: There is a possibility of a liver abscess due to the biliary obstruction and infection.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an increased white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a supratherapeutic INR, indicating a bleeding risk that has been corrected with vitamin K.
6. Femoral stent and peripheral vascular disease: The patient has a femoral stent and peripheral vascular disease, which can increase the risk of vascular complications.
7. Chronic anemia: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 1, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. She presents with sepsis and hypotension and has been diagnosed with polymicrobial bacteremia (Klebsiella and VRE) in the setting of biliary obstruction/cholangitis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure to remove an old stent, clear sludge, and place a new stent. Her insulin regimen has been adjusted, and she is currently on Lantus and SSI.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/46-154/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. She is alert and oriented but more somnolent today. Physical examination reveals clear lung sounds, no murmurs, and equal bilateral blood pressures.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and liver function tests showing improvement post-ERCP. Microbiology results from blood cultures have been negative to date. Additional infection workup, including C. difficile, peritoneal dialysis cultures, urine culture, and follow-up blood cultures, have also been negative.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female admitted to the ICU for polymicrobial sepsis due to bacteremia with klebsiella and VRE likely cholangitis seen on imaging. She underwent an ERCP procedure, during which an old biliary stent was removed, and a new stent was placed. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, demand ischemia, peripheral vascular disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1). She also has hypothyroidism, anemia, and a history of seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing AMS, which can be caused by narcotics, infection, or seizures. Monitoring narcotic use and following up on blood and peritoneal fluid cultures are recommended.

2. Demand Ischemia: The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Continuing beta-blockers and holding statins due to elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are advised.

3. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has a history of R SFA stent placement and angioplasty. Continuing Plavix, restarting ASA after ERCP, and monitoring INR are important for managing this condition.

4. ESRD: The patient is on peritoneal dialysis and has a dwell time of 3 hours. Monitoring peritoneal fluid, following nephrology recommendations, and decreasing cycles"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted on [**8-5**] with polymicrobial sepsis due to bacteremia with Klebsiella and VRE likely cholangitis seen on imaging. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her current condition. These include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can have multiple differential diagnoses including narcotics use, infection, and seizure. Monitoring narcotic use and following up with a CT head are recommended.

2. Demand Ischemia: The patient has elevated troponin levels on admission, indicating possible myocardial ischemia. Continuing beta-blockers and holding statins due to elevated liver function tests are advised.

3. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has a history of recent stent placement in the right superficial femoral artery and angioplasty in the right SFA-ankle. Plavix should be continued given recent stent placement, and aspirin will be restarted 72 hours after the ERCP procedure.

4. ESRD: The patient is on peritoneal dialysis with a dwell time of 3 hours. Peritoneal fluid was bland, not thought to be the source of infection. Nephrology follow-up is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old female admitted to the ICU with polymicrobial sepsis secondary to bacteremia with Klebsiella and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), likely due to cholangitis seen on imaging. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, during which an old biliary stent was removed and a new one was placed. Sludge/stone-like filling defect was observed in the distal common bile duct (CBD). The patient's vital signs are stable, and laboratory results show improving liver function tests (LFTs) and bilirubin levels post-ERCP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient is experiencing altered mental status. Differential diagnoses include narcotics use, infection, and seizure (drugs lowering threshold for seizure). Narcotics are the most likely cause given the administration of morphine at 5 am yesterday. Monitoring narcotic use and following up with blood and peritoneal fluid cultures are recommended.

2. Demand Ischemia: The patient has elevated troponin levels on admission, peak of 0.74 on [**8-7**], suggesting demand ischemia. This is supported by a flat myocardial perfusion imaging (MBI) and unchanged EKG. Continuing beta-blockers (BB) and restarting aspirin (ASA) 72 hours after ERCP are advised.

3. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient had recent stenting"

   disucssed a broad ddx (sz, ifnection, intracranial pathology, co2
   retension or elctolyte imbalance) and work up has been unrevealing.
   Now it seems she had received morphine several hours prior and that is
   liekly etiology.
   Now with mild hyponatremia
this is likely hypovolemic as she had had
   neg fluid balance w/ PD X days and was NPO yesterday.  Hypoithyroid and
   siadh seem less likely and does not appear vol up.  Will resume diet
   and discuss changing PD diaylste with renal tema and montior.  If
   worsens will assess urine lytes and osms.
   We continue linezolid and zosyn for polymicrobial bacteremia. Her WBC
   count and lfts are improving post ercp with stent and she remains af.
   Additional infection w/u has been neg to date including c diff cxs, PD
   cxs, urine and f/u blood cxs with repeat cx
s from yesterday pending.
   Will plan to reimage her  ruq in a few days to guide length of antibx
   course and need for further intervention such as IR-guided drainage
   procedure in regards to ? liver abscesses.  Will also arrange for TTE
   to eval SBE (given staph) as this will loiekly guifde length of antibx
   course.  ID input appreciated. Per ercp will need repeat proceudre in
   several wks with brushings, noting concern for sticture.
   For PVD and femoral stent, she remains on plavix.  Coumadin has been
   restarted and will decrease dose to avoid recurrence of
   supratherapeutic INR while on antibx. Can d/c sq hep and monitor.
   Continues with PD for esrd, per renal. Though likely needs adjustment
   to dialysate as she was 7 L neg yesterday.
   Continue insulin therapy given DM1 with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team following.

s MS and increased somnolence yesterday has resolved.  We discussed
   and evaluated for broad ddx (sz, ifnection, intracranial pathology, co2
   retention or electrolyte imbalance). Work up has been unrevealing.
   Received morphine several hours prior which is likely etiology.
   Now with mild hyponatremia
suspect is hypovolemic, as she had had neg
   fluid balance w/ PD X days and was NPO yesterday.  Hypothyroidism and
   siadh are much less likely.  Will resume diet and discuss changing PD
   diaylsate with renal team.  Will follow na.  If decreases further will
   assess urine lytes and osms.
   We continue linezolid and zosyn for polymicrobial bacteremia. Her WBC
   count and lfts are improving post ercp with stent and she remains af.
   Additional infection w/u has been neg to date including c diff cxs, PD
   cxs, urine and f/u blood cxs with repeat cx
s from yesterday also
   pending.  Will plan to reimage her ruq in a few days to guide length of
   antibx course and assess for need for further intervention such as
   IR-guided drainage procedure in regards to ? liver abscesses.  Will
   also arrange for TTE to eval SBE (given staph uti and bacteremia) as
   this may also impact length of antibx course.  ID input appreciated.
   Per ercp will need repeat procedure in several wks with brushings,
   noting concern for stricture.
   For PVD and femoral stent, she remains on plavix.  Coumadin has been
   restarted and will decrease dose to avoid recurrence of
   supratherapeutic INR while on antibx. Can d/c sq hep.
   Continues with PD for esrd, per renal. Though likely needs adjustment
   to dialysate as she was 7 L neg yesterday.
   Continue insulin therapy given DM1 with [**Last Name (un) 276**] team following.
   Remainder as outlined in resident note.
   Will consult PT and initiate OOB to chair.  D/c foley and rectal bag.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, coronary artery disease (CAD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD). She presented with sepsis and hypotension and was found to have polymicrobial bacteremia, biliary obstruction, cholangitis, and possible liver abscesses. The patient's somnolence and altered mental status have resolved. She continues to have mild hyponatremia, which is being monitored and managed. The patient's white blood cell count and liver function tests are improving after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stent placement. She remains alert and stable, but requires ongoing management for her conditions, including polymicrobial bacteremia, biliary obstruction, possible liver abscesses, chronic anemia, and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Polymicrobial bacteremia: The patient is currently being treated with linezolid and Zosyn for polymicrobial bacteremia. It is important to continue the antibiotic therapy as prescribed to prevent the spread of infection.
2. Biliary obstruction and cholangitis: The patient underwent ERCP with stent placement to address the biliary obstruction and cholangitis. However, there is a concern for possible liver abscesses. Further imaging may be necessary to guide the duration of antibiotic therapy and determine if any additional interventions, such as"
