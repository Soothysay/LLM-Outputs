   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a  46-year-old lady with Malignant Thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   shortness of breath, fatigue, and possible pneumonia.
   .
   SHORTNESS OF BREATH:  Most likely due to progression of cancer, though
   pneumonia or other infection must be excluded.  CXR mentions patchy
   opacities at left lung apex, which are new from prior.  Factors arguing
   for infection include elevated WBC (with increased neutrophils),
   low-grade temp in ED (99), and productive cough.  However, lack of
   bandemia and chronic nature of cough (months) go against diagnosis of
   pneumonia.  Patient's symptoms might all be related to underlying
   disease progression.
   .
   --Send urine, sputum, and blood cultures
   --Treat with 5 days of Levaquin at 750mg QD
   --02 per nasal cannula as needed
   --Albuterol/ipratropium nebs
   --Cough Suppressants
   --Heme/onc consult in AM for evaluation of worsening disease
   --Consider CT chest to evaluate disease progression
   --Consider therapeutic thoracentesis if symptoms worsen
   .
   LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Patient has had elevated WBC in the past, and has been
   slowly rising over the past few months.  Etiologies include worsening
   cancer, malignant pleural effusions, infection, or steroids.
   .
   --Treat empirically for pneumonia
   --Continue to trend white count, fever curve
   --Look at white cells under microscope to evaluate for inflammatory vs.
   malignant process
   .
   HYPONATREMIC:  Drop in sodium from [**Month (only) 594**] to this admission.  Sodium
   is currently 130.  Could be due to worsening lung disease causing an
   SIADH like picture.  PNA has also been known to cause hyponatremia.
   .
   --Free water restrict
   --Gentle NS for volume rescucitation
   --Send plasma osmolality and urine lytes
   --Continue to monitor
   .
   ELEVATED LFTS:  No prior mention of elevated LFTs in patient's history;
   last liver enzymes were checked in [**Month (only) 1996**] of this year and were
   completely normal.  Elevated LFTs likely represent obstructive picture
   from metastatic cancer, with impairment of synthetic function as well
   (i.e. elevated INR)
   .
   --Right upper quadrant ultrasound
   --Consider lactulose re: high ammonia
   --Continue to trend LFTs
   --Consider hepatitis serologies
   .
   MALIGNANT THYMOMA:  Patient had beeen offered hospice in the past,
   though now wants further treatment.  We will defer managment of
   malignancy to heme/onc team.  Consult heme/onc tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of malignant thymoma, admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath, fatigue, and possible pneumonia. She has been experiencing cough for months and has elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate worsening cancer, infection, or other underlying conditions. The patient's vital signs show stable temperature, slightly low blood pressure, normal heart rate, and slightly low oxygen saturation. She is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula. Imaging shows stable opacification of the left lower and mid lung, potentially due to pleural metastatic disease. There is also mention of patchy opacities at the left lung apex, which could represent pneumonia or progression of metastatic disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shortness of breath: The patient's shortness of breath could be attributed to several factors, including progression of cancer, pneumonia, or other infections. It is essential to monitor her respiratory status closely and provide appropriate respiratory support.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate worsening cancer, infection, or other underlying conditions. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which could be due to worsening lung disease causing an SIADH-like picture or metastatic cancer causing hyponatremia. Close monitoring and management of fluid and electrolyte balance is"

   This is a  46-year-old lady with Malignant Thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   shortness of breath, fatigue, and possible pneumonia.
   .
   SHORTNESS OF BREATH:  Most likely due to a combination of progression
   of cancer with an obstructive-pneumonia picture.  Chronicity of problem
   points toward spread of underlying disease, while high white count and
   low-grade temperatures indicate a co-current infection.

   --Albuterol/ipratropium nebs
   --Cough Suppressants
   --Heme/onc consult for evaluation of worsening disease
   --Consider CT chest to evaluate disease progression
   .
   LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Patient has had elevated WBC in the past, and has been
   slowly rising over the past few months.  Etiologies include worsening
   cancer, malignant pleural effusions, infection, or steroids.
   .
   --Treat empirically for pneumonia
   --Continue to trend white count, fever curve
   .
   HYPONATREMIC:  Drop in sodium from [**Month (only) 594**] to this admission.  Sodium
   is currently 130 (same as on admission).  Could be due to worsening
   lung disease causing an SIADH like picture.  PNA has also been known to
   cause hyponatremia.

   ELEVATED LFTS:  No prior mention of elevated LFTs in patient's history;
   last liver enzymes were checked in [**Month (only) 1996**] of this year and were
   completely normal.  Elevated LFTs likely represent obstructive picture
   from metastatic cancer, with impairment of synthetic function as well

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath, fatigue, and possible pneumonia. The patient's symptoms are likely due to a combination of cancer progression and obstructive pneumonia. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and has received various infusions and medications in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been experiencing shortness of breath and fatigue, which could be attributed to pneumonia. The presence of crackles in all lung fields and decreased breath sounds at the left upper lobe, along with the imaging findings, raises concerns for pneumonia. The patient has already been started on empirical antibiotic therapy with Levaquin.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, with readings of 100/65 mmHg. This may indicate hypotension, which could be due to volume depletion or sepsis secondary to infection.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be a response to infection or worsening cancer. Further investigation and monitoring are needed to determine the underlying cause.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low at 130 mEq/L. This could be due to worsening lung disease causing an SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone) or pneumonia-induced hyponatremia. Free water restriction"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old lady admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath, fatigue, and possible pneumonia. She has a history of malignant thymoma. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 100/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is slightly tachycardic and has crackles in all lung fields with decreased breath sounds at the left upper lobe.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 31.3 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 130 mg/dL, and elevated liver function tests with ALT at 212 U/L and AST at 131 U/L. The imaging shows stable opacification of the left lower and mid lung, possibly due to known pleural metastatic disease, and patchy opacities at the left lung apex which could represent pneumonia or progression of metastatic disease.

Plan:

1. Treat empirically for pneumonia with 5 days of Levaquin at 750mg QD starting from [**2122-2-13**].
2. Continue oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula as needed.
3. Administer albuterol/ipratropium nebs and cough suppressants.
4. Consult heme/onc team for evaluation of worsening disease.
5. Consider CT chest to evaluate disease progression.
6. Obtain urine, sputum, and blood cultures.
7. Monitor and trend white count, fever curve, and liver function tests.
8. Free water restrict and add gentle NS for volume resuscitation to address hyponatremia.
9. Add plasma osmolality and continue to monitor sodium levels.
10. Right upper quadrant ultrasound and consider lactulose if the patient becomes encephalopathic due to elevated LFTs.
11. Consult heme/onc team for coordination of further management of malignancy.
12. Define code status with the input of primary providers.
13. Continue ICU care with regular diet, glycemic control, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and no VAP prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient may develop complications related to pneumonia, such as worsening hypoxia, sepsis, or respiratory failure.
2. Malignant Pleural Effusion: The patient's known pleural metastatic disease may lead to complications like pleural effusion, which can cause respiratory distress.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen, leading to symptoms like confusion, seizures, or respiratory distress.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The elevated liver function tests indicate possible liver dysfunction, which may progress and lead to hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Metastatic Disease Progression: The patient's malignant thymoma with known pleural metastatic disease may progress further, leading to complications like respiratory compromise or organ failure."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of myasthenia gravis and malignant thymoma. He presents with respiratory distress, which is attributed to pneumonia or progression of malignancy. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress and clear breath sounds bilaterally.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 31.3 K/uL, hematocrit of 40.3%, platelet count of 217 K/uL, creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL, glucose of 128 mg/dL, and an electrolyte panel showing hypokalemia (potassium of 3.3 mEq/L) and hyponatremia (sodium of 128 mg/dL). The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 212 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 131 U/L. Other lab values indicate an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 203 IU/L and low albumin level of 2.6 g/dL.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 46-year-old with a history of myasthenia gravis and malignant thymoma.
- The patient presents with respiratory distress, which is attributed to a pulmonary infiltrate likely caused by pneumonia or progression of underlying thymoma.
- Other notable findings include hypotension, hyponatremia, jaundice, and hypokalemia.
- The patient is critically ill and currently receiving ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if the pneumonia progresses or if there is further deterioration of the underlying thymoma.
2. Pneumonia: If left untreated, the pneumonia can lead to severe lung infection and potential sepsis.
3. Thymoma Progression: The progression of the malignant thymoma can result in further respiratory compromise and potentially spread to other organs.
4. Hyponatremia: If not managed appropriately, hyponatremia can lead to seizures, neurological dysfunction, and even coma.
5. Jaundice: The underlying cause of jaundice should be investigated promptly to prevent complications associated with liver dysfunction.
6. Hypokalemia: Severe hypokalemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory issues.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a  46-year-old lady with Malignant Thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   shortness of breath, fatigue, and possible pneumonia.
   .
   SHORTNESS OF BREATH:  Most likely due to a combination of progression
   of cancer with an obstructive-pneumonia picture.  Chronicity of problem
   points toward spread of underlying disease, while high white count and
   low-grade temperatures indicate a co-current infection.
   --Await urine, sputum, and blood cultures
   --Treat with 5 days of Levaquin at 750mg QD, with day #1 being [**2122-2-13**]
   --02 per nasal cannula as needed
   --Albuterol/ipratropium nebs
   --Cough Suppressants
   --Heme/onc consult for evaluation of worsening disease
   --Consider CT chest to evaluate disease progression
   .
   LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Patient has had elevated WBC in the past, and has been
   slowly rising over the past few months.  Etiologies include worsening
   cancer, malignant pleural effusions, infection, or steroids.
   .
   --Treat empirically for pneumonia
   --Continue to trend white count, fever curve
   .
   HYPONATREMIC:  Drop in sodium from [**Month (only) 594**] to this admission.  Sodium
   is currently 130 (same as on admission).  Could be due to worsening
   lung disease causing an SIADH like picture.  PNA has also been known to
   cause hyponatremia.
   .
   --Free water restrict
   --Gentle NS for volume rescucitation
   --Add on plasma osmolality
   --Continue to monitor
   .
   ELEVATED LFTS:  No prior mention of elevated LFTs in patient's history;
   last liver enzymes were checked in [**Month (only) 1996**] of this year and were
   completely normal.  Elevated LFTs likely represent obstructive picture
   from metastatic cancer, with impairment of synthetic function as well
   (i.e. elevated INR)
   .
   --Right upper quadrant ultrasound
   --Consider lactulose re: high ammonia if patient becomes
   encephalopathic
   --Continue to trend LFTs
   .
   MALIGNANT THYMOMA:  Patient had beeen offered hospice in the past,
   though now wants further treatment.  We will defer managment of
   malignancy to heme/onc team.  Consult heme/onc today for coordination
   of further management.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old lady with malignant thymoma admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath, fatigue, and possible pneumonia. The patient has several medical conditions and potential complications that need to be addressed.

1. Shortness of breath: The patient's shortness of breath is most likely due to a combination of progression of cancer with an obstructive-pneumonia picture. The chronicity of the problem points towards the spread of underlying disease, while the high white count and low-grade temperatures indicate a co-current infection. The plan is to await urine, sputum, and blood cultures, treat with 5 days of Levaquin at 750mg QD, provide supplemental oxygen, administer albuterol/ipratropium nebs, use cough suppressants, consult a hematology/oncology team for evaluation of worsening disease, and consider a CT chest to evaluate disease progression.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has had elevated WBC in the past, and it has been slowly rising over the past few months. Etiologies include worsening cancer, malignant pleural effusions, infection, or steroids. The plan is to treat empirically for pneumonia and continue to trend the white count and fever curve.

3. Hyponatremia: The drop in sodium from [Month] to this admission is concerning. Sodium is currently 130 (same as on admission). Hyponatremia could"

   This is a  46-year-old lady with Malignant Thymoma admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   shortness of breath, fatigue, and possible pneumonia.
   .
   BACTEREMIA:  Listeria identified as a cause, common in immunosupressed
   hosts such as Ms [**Known lastname **].  First line is ampillin, though pt is allergic.
   Will consult ID re: treatment, need for lP, monitoring.
   - NO raw dairy

   HYPONATREMIC:  Drop in sodium from [**Month (only) 594**] to this admission.  Sodium
   is currently 135  after normal saline.  Seems to be appropriate ADH.
   Could be due to worsening lung disease causing an SIADH like picture.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 46-year-old lady with a history of malignant thymoma. She was admitted for shortness of breath, fatigue, and possible pneumonia. She has bacteremia caused by Listeria monocytogenes, which is common in immunosuppressed hosts. The first-line treatment for listeriosis is ampicillin, but the patient is allergic to penicillins. An infectious disease consultation has been requested to determine the appropriate treatment and need for a lumbar puncture.

The patient's shortness of breath is most likely due to disease progression with an obstructive pneumonia picture. The high white blood cell count and low-grade temperatures indicate a concurrent infection. She has been treated empirically for pneumonia and will reassess given the bacteremia.

The patient also has leukocytosis, which is most likely due to bacteremia. Other contributing etiologies include worsening cancer, malignant pleural effusions, infection, or steroids. Treatment for pneumonia and optimization of treatment for listeriosis have been initiated.

The patient has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 135. This could be due to worsening lung disease causing an SIADH-like picture or pneumonia. Normal saline boluses have been administered as needed.

Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) have been noted, which may represent an obstructive picture from metastatic cancer."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis and malignant thymoma, currently experiencing respiratory distress. The respiratory distress is attributed to a pulmonary infiltrate, likely pneumonia in the left lower lobe, although progression of underlying thymoma cannot be excluded. The patient also has bacteremia with Listeria isolated, possibly related to dietary practices or recent animal exposure. Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and jaundice are also present. The jaundice may be related to disease progression or medication effect. The patient has a history of chronic steroid use, which increases the risk of opportunistic infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The pulmonary infiltrate and respiratory distress could lead to further complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, or pneumonia progression.

2. Infection: The presence of bacteremia with Listeria suggests a risk of systemic infection. This may lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.

3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia and hypokalemia need careful monitoring and management to avoid complications such as seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, or muscle weakness.

4. Liver Abnormalities: The elevated liver enzymes and jaundice could indicate liver dysfunction, which may be related to the underlying malignancy or medication side effects. This can potentially lead to hep"
