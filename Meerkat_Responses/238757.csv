   bronchospasm on exam with high pip and plateau pressures on vent. No
   evidence PNA on CXR and normal WBC count, however was significantly
   hypothermic at NH. PE less likely.
   - Hold on diuresis for now given pressor requirement post-intubation
   - Continue vanco/CTX/levo for now
   - MDIs while intubated, solumedrol 60 IV daily
   - Reposition ET tube and repeat CXR
   # Hypotension: Possibly related to medications peri-intubation, but
   sepsis and cardiogenic also on differential. Unlikely hypovolemic given
   appearance of significant volume overload on examination. Primary
   adrenal cause also unlikely.
   - Wean dopamine, maintain MAP>65
   - Place A-line
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Send sputum
   - Continue antibiotics
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   # CHF: Ischemic etiology. EF 25% s/p ICD. Volume overloaded on exam,
   with CXR consistent with CHF. Hold on diuresis for now until stable off
   pressors, then gently. Hold beta-blocker and ACEi until weaned from

   # CAD: s/p MI and multiple stents with known chronic LAD total
   occlusion. No new ECG changes but has basline LAFB; initial enzymes
   negative.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   - Hold beta-blocker given pressor requirement
   - Cycle enzymes, repeat ECG
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Baseline Cre 1.0, currently 1.3. Likely pre-renal. Will follow
   s/p volume resuscitation in ED. Hold ACEi and lasix.
   # Diabetes type 2: Continue home insulin regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 25%), diabetes mellitus type 2, and asthma. She presented with acute shortness of breath and altered mental status, likely due to congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. She was found hypothermic at the nursing home and has a high respiratory rate and low blood pressure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. She is also receiving sedation with midazolam and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to CHF, and there is evidence of bronchospasm on examination. The high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and plateau pressures on the ventilator suggest the possibility of ventilator-induced lung injury. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and regular chest X-rays should be done to assess the progression of respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to medications given during intubation, but sepsis and cardiogenic causes are also on the differential. Unlikely hypovolemic given the significant volume overload on examination, primary adrenal cause is also unlikely. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate fluid"

There is evidence of bronchospasm on examination, high peak inspiratory pressures (PIP), and plateau pressures on the ventilator. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation status closely.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, possibly related to medications given peri-intubation. Other causes such as sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and primary adrenal insufficiency should also be considered. The patient's blood pressure should be closely monitored and appropriate measures taken to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg.

3. CHF Exacerbation: The patient's presentation is consistent with an exacerbation of CHF, likely secondary to ischemic etiology given her history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous myocardial infarction. The patient appears volume overloaded on examination, and her chest X-ray is consistent with CHF"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 25%), diabetes mellitus type 2, and asthma. She presented with acute shortness of breath and altered mental status in the setting of congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she has been experiencing hypotension that has improved now that she is off pressors. The patient's kidney function has improved, and her fluid balance is being closely monitored. She is also receiving diuretics for volume overload and to manage respiratory failure due to CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to CHF. If not managed properly, there is a risk of further deterioration in her respiratory status, leading to hypoxemia and eventual respiratory arrest.
2. Hypotension: Although the patient's hypotension has improved, there is still a risk of recurrent hypotension, especially if the underlying cause is not adequately addressed. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. If not appropriately treated, the infection can worsen, leading to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Kidney Dysfunction: Although the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 25%), diabetes mellitus type 2, and asthma. She presented with acute shortness of breath and altered mental status in the setting of congestive heart failure exacerbation.

24-hour events:
- Blood culture grew gram-positive cocci, for now, vancomycin was restarted pending speciation.
- Lasix was given with good urine output.
- Tolerated sedation wean (on 10 and 1).
- Hematocrit stable at 32.1 (31.1).
- Too somnolent during the day to try pressure support ventilation (PSV), can try again in the morning.

Infusions:
- Midazolam (Versed) - 2 mg/hour
- Fentanyl - 25 mcg/hour

Other ICU medications:
- Famotidine (Pepcid) - [2195-5-15] 12:06 AM

   #Hypoxemic resp failure
   Minimal vent settings w/good RSBI though MS poor, so not ready for
   extubation
   Rapid steroid taper
   Continue diuresis, I/O goal -1L
   #Altered mental status
   Minimally responsive despite very low doses fent/versed.  Plan change
   to sedation from fent/versed to propofol and then try and wake up- if
   MS continues to be poor, will need head CT.
   #Positive bld cx
   CNS, likely contaminant as subseqent cxs neg, stop vanco today.
   #HTN
   BP improving, if still elevated after changing to propofol, will add
   back ACEI for afterload reduction given sig LV systolic dysfxn.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She also has multiple stents placed, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 25%, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Additionally, she has a history of asthma.

The patient presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and was intubated in the emergency department after a failed trial of bipap. She required dopamine briefly during peri-intubation but has been off since arrival to the ICU. A chest X-ray showed bilateral effusions, and she was likely experiencing a congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation possibly combined with an asthma exacerbation. The cause of the exacerbation is unclear as the EKG remained unchanged, cardiac enzymes were negative, and there were no signs of infection (normal temperature, white blood cell count within normal limits, and no sputum production).

The patient has been treated with diuretics to remove approximately 1.5 liters of fluid, steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Currently, she is maintaining good oxygen saturation on assist control mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 59. The plan is to continue diuresis,"

   at NH w/temp 92), WBC wnl, no sputum).  Diuresed ~1.5L since admission;
   also treated w/steroids and broad spectrum abx.  Currently w/good

   #Altered mental status
   Minimally responsive despite very low doses fent/versed.  Plan change
   to sedation from fent/versed to propofol and then try and wake up- if
   MS continues to be poor, will need head CT.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 25%, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and asthma. The patient presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, hypotension, and altered mental status, leading to intubation in the emergency department after a failed trial of non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP). 

On admission to the ICU, the patient required dopamine briefly but has been off since arrival. The chest X-ray revealed bilateral effusions, suggesting a possible exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) or asthma exacerbation. The cause of the exacerbation is unclear, as the EKG is unchanged, cardiac enzymes are negative, and there is no evidence of infection. The patient has been treated with diuretics, steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Currently, the patient is oxygenating well on assisted mechanical ventilation with good respiratory system compliance, and wheezing has resolved. The plan is to continue diuresis, quickly wean steroids, and discontinue antibiotics. Sedation will be lightened, with a plan to switch to pressure support ventilation (PSV). 

The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, indicating no evidence of infection. Laboratory values show slightly elevated potassium levels and decreased bicarbonate levels. The patient's renal function is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and asthma. The patient presented with acute shortness of breath, altered mental status, and was diagnosed with a congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.

The patient has shown improvement in her respiratory status, as she was successfully extubated the previous evening and was tolerating high-flow oxygen well. Diuretics have been continued to manage fluid overload.

The patient's hypotension has also improved, and she is now off pressors. It is likely that the hypotension was due to baseline poor cardiac output and intubation. Monitoring with diuretics will be continued, and if blood pressure allows, ACE inhibitors will be restarted prior to restarting beta-blockers during acute CHF exacerbation.

The patient has an identified infection with Staphylococcus aureus coag-neg in her blood culture, but it is believed to be a contaminant. Vancomycin has been stopped.

The patient's mental status changes are attributed to ICU delirium, most likely caused by midazolam received for intubation. Sedating medications will be held, and mental status will continue to be monitored. The patient is at risk for aspiration, so nas"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 25%), diabetes mellitus type 2, and asthma. She presented with acute shortness of breath, altered mental status, and a suspected exacerbation of congestive heart failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/56 to 115/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on aerosol-cool with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are some abnormalities in her lab results, including elevated WBC count, slightly low platelet count, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation included acute shortness of breath and altered mental status, which are consistent with respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating a significant respiratory compromise.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show fluctuations, indicating potential hypotension. The patient has been off pressors, but close monitoring is required.
3. Congestive heart failure ("

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo female with h/o CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy and admit with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and post intubation hypotension.  She now
   has been successfully extubated with reasonable stability of
   ventilation by ABG evaluation.  She had a likely combination of volume
   overload and possibly triggered bronchospasm leading to initial
   failure.
   Respiratory Failure-
   Patient with continued O2 requirement
has reasonable capacity to
   protect airway from recurrent aspiration but will maintain caution.
   -Continue diuresis
   -Will not D/C a-line at this time
will need follow up examination and
   ultrasound of upper extremity to rule out DVT
   -Could consider lasix gtt to allow stable and steady diuresis
   Congestive Heart Failure-Chronic and acute systolic dysfunction-
   -Has tolerated diuresis and will continue it
   -Will need to return afterload reduction into place at this time.
   -For CAD treatment willl need to restart Anti=platelet agents
   Altered Mental Status-
   -Continue with aspiration precautions
   -Is encephalopathy by exam
   -Will move to CT for focal deficit or worsening of encephalopathy

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy. She was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and post-intubation hypotension. The patient has been successfully extubated and is now showing reasonable stability of ventilation. Her respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of volume overload and bronchospasm. The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen but has the capacity to protect her airway from recurrent aspiration.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially failed to wean off the ventilator, indicating difficulty in maintaining adequate gas exchange. This could be due to factors such as volume overload and bronchospasm. Continuous oxygen requirement suggests ongoing respiratory compromise.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has chronic and acute systolic dysfunction, which is likely contributing to her current condition. She has tolerated diuretic therapy and will continue with it.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): There is a concern for DVT, especially given the patient's immobility and use of central venous catheters. An ultrasound of the upper extremity is recommended to rule out DVT.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to encephalopathy. She requires continued aspiration precautions and may need further evaluation with a CT scan if her condition worsens.
5. Glycemic Control: The patient requires regular insulin"

   asthma presenting with acute shortness of breath and altered mental
   status in the setting of CHF exacerbation
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic likely due to CHF.
   - diuresed >3L yesterday with 40mg IV lasix x 1 in am.  Goal even to
   500 negative today.   Will hold on lasix for the am. Give in pm if
   positive (20mg IV)
   - Wean 02 as tolerated
   - off prednisone yesterday, rapid taper for possible superimposed
   asthma exacerbation
   # Hypotension: improved now; off pressors.  Likely in setting of
   baseline poor CO and intubation.
   -  Maintained stable BP despite very aggressive diuresis.
   -  Restart BB today, consider restarting ACEI tomorrow if remains
   stable.
   -  stopped vancomycin for positive blood culture; only
 and was
   s.aureus coag negative. Likely contaminant. No other positive culture
   data, unlikely sepsis as etiology for hypotension.
   # Atrial tachycardia.  Has paroxysmal episodes of ectopic atrial
   tachycardia with HR to 140s, BP lower during these times. Responded
   will to dilt gtt yesterday, will few bursts to low 100s, HR typically
   in 70s.
   -attempt to wean dilt today
   -restart BB, home dose is 25 metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], will try TID for now while
   trying to wean dilt
   -continue to keep even/negative as volume overload may have contributed
   to her development of atrial tach.
   # CHF: Ischemic etiology. EF 25% s/p ICD. Volume overloaded on exam,
   with CXR consistent with CHF.
   - restarting BB, poss restart ACEI tomorrow
   - goal negative 0-500cc today
   #AMS
 exam c/w ICU delerium, most likely in setting of midazolam
   received for intubation.  Has been improving.
   -trial of PO, restart po meds. Thus far swallowing without difficulty,
   SPL c/s if concern for aspiration risk.
   -follow up cultures
   #LUE swelling, new.  U/s showed upper extremitiy DVT with complete
   occlusion of subclavian, axiallary vein.  No involvement of IJ. Pt pain
   free.  Likely developed insetting of endothelial injury during multiple
   line placement attempts in setting of previously placed pacer wires.
   -elevate arm
   -removed a-line
   # CAD: s/p MI and multiple stents with known chronic LAD total
   occlusion. No new ECG changes but has basline LAFB; initial enzymes
   negative.
   - Continue ASA, plavix, statin
   -hold ACE, restart BB

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2, and asthma. She presented with acute shortness of breath and altered mental status in the setting of congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including diuretics, antibiotics, and medications for her chronic conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to baseline poor cardiac output and intubation. It needs to be closely monitored and managed.
3. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing episodes of ectopic atrial tachycardia, which can cause an increased heart rate and potentially lead to complications if not controlled.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed a left upper extremity DVT with complete occlusion of the subclavian and axillary veins. This can potentially result in further complications if not treated appropriately.
5. ICU delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to midazolam received for intubation. Close monitoring is necessary to assess for delirium and provide appropriate care.
6. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's baseline creatinine levels indicate possible chronic kidney disease. Regular monitoring is required to manage this"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 25%), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with acute shortness of breath and altered mental status in the setting of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient had a complete thrombosis of the left subclavian vein and left axillary vein with no extension into the left jugular vein.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is hypoxic likely due to CHF. Continuous diuresis with furosemide 40 mg IV was initiated, and she responded well. She successfully extubated last evening and is currently on high flow oxygen.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure improved now and is off pressors. It is likely in the setting of baseline poor cardiac output and intubation. Monitoring with diuresis is recommended, and if tolerated, restarting ACE inhibitors prior to restarting beta-blockers in the setting of acute CHF exacerbation is advised.
3. CHF: The patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 25% and has received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She is volume overloaded on examination, and her chest X-ray is consistent with CHF. Holding beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for now is advised, with the intention"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with acute shortness of breath and altered mental status in the setting of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (T) at 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate (HR) ranging from 81 bpm to 142 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 148/67 mmHg to 95/22 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 91%. The patient's rhythm is sinus with occasional ectopic atrial tachycardia.

The patient has been receiving various treatments, including diuretics, anticoagulants, and cardiac medications. She also has a history of asthma and is currently on MDIs as needed. The patient's renal function is impaired, with elevated serum creatinine levels.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is hypoxic likely due to CHF. Continuous diuresis with furosemide has been initiated, and the goal is to achieve an intake/output balance of -1L.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved, and she is no longer on pressors."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus type 2, and asthma. She presented with acute shortness of breath and altered mental status in the setting of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient underwent intubation and is currently in the ICU. She has been receiving diuretics, vasopressors, and other medications. Her condition has improved, but she continues to have respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient also has a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to CHF exacerbation. If not managed properly, she may experience worsening respiratory failure, which could lead to further deterioration of her mental status and potential complications like pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to baseline poor cardiac output and intubation. If not monitored closely and managed appropriately, it may result in organ hypoperfusion and potential multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Left upper extremity DVT: The patient has a confirmed complete thrombosis of the left subclavian vein and left axillary vein. If left untreated, it could lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism or further venous thromboembolism events.

   69 yo female with admission with altered mental status and hypoxemia.
   She has had reasonable response to diuresis over past 24 hours
   suggesting significant contribution from volume overload at this time.
   Will, by problems-->
   1)Hypoxemia-Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue diuresis
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -Will maintain goal of 500cc negative only today given hypernatremia
   and increased HCO3 with likely contraction alkalosis
   2)Altered Mental Status-
   -Continue exam with hope for continued improvement towards baseline
   -CT, again, for worsening or focal deficit
   -Stabilize electrolyte abnormalities
   3)Atrial Tachycardia-
   -Patient with Dilt gtt
   -Wean to B-blocker as tolerated
   4)Upper Extremity DVT-
   -Will monitor exam
   -Would consider anticoagulation in the setting of UE DVT if extension
   seen or clinical syndrome consistent with PE leading to evaluation and
   treatment for PE

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient's response to diuresis suggests a significant contribution from volume overload. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemia-Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen levels may lead to respiratory failure if not adequately managed. Continued diuresis, weaning off oxygen, and maintaining a negative fluid balance are recommended to address this issue.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status should continue to be monitored for improvement towards baseline. If there is no improvement or worsening, a CT scan may be necessary to evaluate for any focal deficits. Stabilizing electrolyte abnormalities is also important in improving mental status.

3. Atrial Tachycardia: The patient is being treated with Diltiazem for atrial tachycardia. Weaning off Diltiazem and considering beta-blocker therapy as tolerated is advised.

4. Upper Extremity Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Monitoring the patient's exam is crucial, and anticoagulation may be considered if there is extension of the DVT or clinical signs consistent with a pulmonary embolism (PE). Further evaluation and treatment for PE should be considered if appropriate.

Overall, close monitoring and management of these potential complications are essential for the patient's well-being."

   69F h/o CAD s/p multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), DM2,
   asthma presenting with acute shortness of breath and altered mental
   status in the setting of CHF exacerbation
   # Respiratory failure: Hypoxic likely due to CHF.
   - diuresed >3L yesterday with 40mg IV lasix x 1 in am.  Goal even to
   500 negative today.   Will hold on lasix for the am. Give in pm if
   positive (20mg IV)
   - Wean 02 as tolerated
   - off prednisone yesterday, rapid taper for possible superimposed
   asthma exacerbation
   # Hypotension: improved now; off pressors.  Likely in setting of
   baseline poor CO and intubation.
   -  Maintained stable BP despite very aggressive diuresis.
   -  Restart BB today, consider restarting ACEI tomorrow if remains
   stable.
   -  stopped vancomycin for positive blood culture; only
 and was
   s.aureus coag negative. Likely contaminant. No other positive culture
   data, unlikely sepsis as etiology for hypotension.
   # Atrial tachycardia.  Has paroxysmal episodes of ectopic atrial
   tachycardia with HR to 140s, BP lower during these times. Responded
   will to dilt gtt yesterday, will few bursts to low 100s, HR typically
   in 70s.
   -attempt to wean dilt today
   -restart BB, home dose is 25 metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], will try TID for now while
   trying to wean dilt
   -continue to keep even/negative as volume overload may have contributed
   to her development of atrial tach.
   # CHF: Ischemic etiology. EF 25% s/p ICD. Volume overloaded on exam,
   with CXR consistent with CHF.
   - restarting BB, poss restart ACEI tomorrow
   - goal negative 0-500cc today
   #AMS
 exam c/w ICU delerium, most likely in setting of midazolam
   received for intubation.  Has been improving.
   -trial of PO, restart po meds. Thus far swallowing without difficulty,
   SPL c/s if concern for aspiration risk.
   -follow up cultures
   #LUE swelling, new.  U/s showed upper extremitiy DVT with complete
   occlusion of subclavian, axiallary vein.  No involvement of IJ. Pt pain
   free.  Likely developed insetting of endothelial injury during multiple
   line placement attempts in setting of previously placed pacer wires.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 25%), diabetes mellitus type 2, and asthma. She presented with acute shortness of breath, altered mental status, and a confirmed diagnosis of congestive heart failure exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to the exacerbation of congestive heart failure. Diuretics have been administered, and the goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of 500 mL today. The patient's oxygen delivery device is set to nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient had improved hypotension, likely secondary to baseline poor cardiac output and intubation. Pressors have been held, and the patient's blood pressure remains stable despite aggressive diuresis. Beta-blockers will be restarted today, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be restarted tomorrow if the patient remains stable.

3. Atrial tachycardia: The patient has had episodes of ectopic atrial tachycardia with heart rates up to 140 beats per minute. These episodes were associated with lower blood pressure. Diltiazem has been effective in controlling the heart rate. An attempt will be made to wean off diltiazem today, and metoprolol will be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, s/p multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), diabetes mellitus type 2, asthma, and depression. She presented with acute shortness of breath and altered mental status in the setting of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been diagnosed with atrial tachycardia, ICU delirium (AMS), and upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with complete occlusion of the subclavian and axillary vein.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CHF exacerbation: The patient's presentation and history suggest an acute exacerbation of CHF. If not properly managed, it can lead to respiratory distress, fluid overload, and worsening cardiac function.
2. Atrial tachycardia: The patient's episodes of ectopic atrial tachycardia with heart rates up to 140s and low blood pressure may indicate a potential complication of atrial fibrillation or flutter, which can cause hemodynamic instability.
3. ICU delirium (AMS): The patient's altered mental status could be due to ICU delirium, which can increase the risk of falls, infections, and other complications.
4. Upper extremity DVT: The presence of an upper extremity DVT with complete occlusion of the subclavian and axillary vein"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She also has a history of asthma. The patient presented with likely congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and possible asthma exacerbation. She was intubated in the emergency department after failed non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and was extubated on [**5-15**] following improvement with diuretics. The patient was observed to have a slow recovery after extubation.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 114/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.46, PCO2 of 55 mmHg, and PO2 of 81 mmHg. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles and scattered expiratory wheezes in the bases bilaterally, and she is responsive to simple commands but not fully oriented to self.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.7 thousand/mm3, hematocrit"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 25%), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and asthma. She was admitted with likely congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation possibly accompanied by an asthma exacerbation. She required intubation in the emergency department after failed bipap. The patient improved with diuretics and was extubated on [5-15]. Since extubation, she has been slowly waking up. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), blood pressure ranging from 114/66 mmHg to 136/90 mmHg, heart rate of 105 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. She is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 4 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.

Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for a significant improvement in interactivity and mental status. The patient has no known drug allergies. Her last dose of antibiotics was on [2195-5-18]. She is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium for prophylaxis, lasix, lopressor, and atrovent nebs every 6 hours.

The patient's flow sheet data shows stable hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. Her laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.7, hematocrit (Hct) of 30.9, platelet (Plt) count of 200, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 35, glucose level of 109, and other lab values within normal ranges.

Imaging shows interstitial pulmonary edema on a chest X-ray taken on [5-18], and the position of the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line is okay.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's condition is attributed to a likely CHF exacerbation possibly accompanied by an asthma exacerbation. The significant response to diuretics and treatment for heart failure suggests that this was the major contributor. Asthma/COPD exacerbation may have also contributed. The goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance today, and the patient will continue on bronchodilators.

Other assessments include metabolic alkalosis likely due to diuresis, heart failure (systolic) acute and chronic, altered mental status/delirium, atrial tachycardia, upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and potential subdural hematoma (SDH). 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving artificial nutrition and hydration (ADAT), regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, PICC line for medication administration, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and elevation of head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to a combination of volume overload and an asthma exacerbation. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate of 105 bpm and a slightly elevated blood pressure of 114/66 mmHg. The respiratory rate is also on the higher end at 25 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is within normal range at 97%.

The patient has been receiving nebulizer treatments every 6 hours and will continue to do so as needed for asthma management. Additionally, the patient will be restarted on home lasix 40mg twice daily to address the volume overload.

There is a mention of metabolic alkalosis, which is believed to be caused by diuresis. It is noted that giving diamox would require the patient to increase their minute ventilation, so this intervention is not recommended.

The patient is also diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) and is still considered volume overloaded, although improvements have been made. The same lasix regimen as mentioned earlier will be restarted, along with the reintroduction of home ACE inhibitors.

The patient's altered mental status is improving, but confirmation with the family is still pending. The patient's code status remains as full code, and the disposition is planned for transfer to the floor.

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening respiratory failure, exacerbation of asthma symptoms, volume overload leading to worsening CHF,"

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing respiratory failure, which is being managed with CPAP/PSV ventilation, a nasal cannula, and supplemental oxygen. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 55, and PaO2 of 69, suggesting a respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 114/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 93.8 kg, and they have received a total of 1,271 mL of fluids since midnight.

The patient has a history of asthma exacerbation, and their chest examination reveals crackles at the bases bilaterally and scattered expiratory wheezes. The patient's oxygen delivery device is a nasal cannula, with settings including FiO2 of 30% and PEEP of 4 cmH2O. The patient's ABG values are within acceptable ranges.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of 200 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 109 to 198 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances such as sodium of 40 mEq/L and potassium of 3.7 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging reveals interstitial pulmonary edema on a chest X-ray taken on 5/18, and the position of the PICC line appears to be correct. 

Based on the assessment, the patient has respiratory failure due to volume overload and asthma exacerbation. The plan includes restarting home lasix 40mg po bid with an input/output goal of 1L negative, continuing nebs standing and as needed for asthma, and arranging an outpatient sleep evaluation.

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis likely secondary to diuresis, and congestive heart failure with ongoing volume overload. Lasix has been restarted, along with a restart of home ACE inhibitors. The patient's altered mental status is improving, and it is recommended to confirm bilateral findings with family.

The patient's code status is full code, and they will be transferred to the floor. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, a PICC line, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's HOB (head of bed) elevation is being used to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   ICD, and asthma a/w likely CHF exacerbation +/- asthma exacerbation,
   precipitant unclear.  Intubated in ED after failed bipap.  Improved
   w/diuresis and extubated [**5-15**].  Slowly waking up after extubation.
   #Respiratory failure - Vol overload + asthma exacerbation.  CXR [**5-18**]
   with e/o vol overload but no new infiltrate.
   -restart home lasix 40mg po bid with I/O goal 1L neg
   -cont nebs standing and prn for asthma
   -needs outpatient sleep eval
   #Metabolic alkalosis - likely [**2-21**] diuresis, will not give diamox as
   doing so would require patient to increase her minute ventilation
   #CHF - still vol overloaded, though much improved.  Lasix as above.
   Restart home ACEI
   Altered mental status - improving.  Confirm b/l with family
 consider
   head CT if pt far off her b/l.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 25%, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She also has a history of asthma. The patient was admitted with likely congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation possibly compounded by an asthma exacerbation. 

She was intubated in the emergency department after failing noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). She showed improvement with diuresis and was subsequently extubated on [**5-15**]. However, she remained sedated and confused after extubation. 

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, a heart rate of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 114/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. 

Her physical examination revealed crackles in the bases bilaterally and scattered expiratory wheezes. She is well-nourished but overweight/obese. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.7 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium of 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine of"
