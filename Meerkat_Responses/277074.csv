   Assessment and Plan
   67F with stage 4 pancreatic cancer now p/w 4 days of nausea and
   vomiting, inabaility to tolerate po, and fatigue, found to have
   hyponatremia, hyerkalemia, and acute renal insufficiency
   .
   #. Nausea and vomiting - most likely etiology is profound ileus from
   meds, SBP, carcinomatosis, vs incomplete SBO, constipation, massive
   ascites, vs. extrinsic compresison of mass into UGI tract. Pt with
   recent thrush but her complaint does not appear a primary esophageal
   one. Other DDx includes SBP as elevated WBC count in peritoneal fluid
   (73% polys) peritonitis, primary or secondary, esp given recent
   catheter placement and elevated WBC count. Has been deemed an
   unacceptable risk for surgical pallliation.
   -- advance diet to sips, ADAT consider NGT if e/o SBO (not seen on CT
   scan)
   -- symptomatic control with zofran, compazine, ativan
   -- pain control with prn dilaudid and fentanyl patch
   -- f/u micro data; urine and blood cultures
   #. [**Name (NI) 9741**] unclear if peritoneal fluid is infection from SBP or
   from pleurex catheter; at any rate, treatment with IV Ceftriaxone
   should be sufficient to cover the GNRs from SBP and the GPCs from
   catheter-related infection.
   -- increase IV CTX to 2gm daily (as per SBP tx)
   -- d/c cipro and flagyl
   -- f/u pending culture data
   .
   #. Stage IV pancreatic Cancer - has been on palliative chemo with
   recent decision to move towards hospice care as an outpatient.
   -- contact outpatient onc Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9717**]/[**Doctor Last Name 2998**]
   -- is well known to palliative care, team, will consult as inpatient
   -- therapeutic drainage of ascites for comfort
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - s/p calcium, kayexylate, insulin/D50 in ED
   -- trend K [**Hospital1 **]
   -- recheck EKG now
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - likely hypovolemic given n/v, ketonuria, urine SG,
   and ARF. No e/o MS changes. Was 129 on d/c on [**11-29**].
   -- check urine lytes, osms
   -- continue IV NS maintenance
   -- give 500cc IV NS bolus, recheck Na
   -- q6h sodiums, goal to increase 0.5 mEq/hr
   .
   # ARF - Cr. 1.4 from 1.0, likely prerenal
   -- check urine lytes, osms, eos
   -- IVF
   -- trend Cr
   -- renally dose meds
   .
   #. recent thrush - no evidence of this currently
   -- oral nystatin prn
   .
   # constipation -
   -- [**Hospital1 **] standing colace and senna
   -- add daily miralax
   -- add [**Hospital1 **] lactulose
   .
   # h/o PE
   -- renally adjust lovenox dose
   .
   #. rash - unclear etiology, may be related to lidoderm patch recently
   used
   -- monitor for now
   .
   # Hypothyroid
   -- continue levothyroxine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with stage 4 pancreatic cancer who has been admitted to the ICU with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal insufficiency. 

The patient's medical complications and potential medical conditions include:

1. Nausea and vomiting: The possible etiologies include profound ileus from medications, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), carcinomatosis, incomplete small bowel obstruction (SBO), constipation, massive ascites, or extrinsic compression of the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract by the pancreatic mass.

2. Hyponatremia: The likely cause is hypovolemic, given the patient's nausea, vomiting, ketonuria, urine specific gravity (SG), and acute renal failure (ARF). The sodium level was initially 129 on discharge on [11-29]. The plan is to continue IV normal saline (NS) maintenance, give a 500cc IV NS bolus, recheck sodium, and trend it every 6 hours with a goal to increase the sodium by 0.5 mEq/hr.

3. Hyperkalemia: The patient had an EKG showing peaked T waves, and the potassium level was 5.5 mEq/L. She received calcium gluconate, kayexalate, and insulin/D50 in the emergency department. The potassium levels should be monitored"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old female with stage 4 pancreatic cancer presenting with nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism, depression, and a previous pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently on palliative chemotherapy and has recently been transitioned to hospice care.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 111/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Physical examination findings include conjunctival pallor, slightly distended abdomen with pleurex catheter in place, 2+ peripheral edema, and mottled appearance to the flanks and lower back with discrete erythematous macules on the anterior thighs.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 34.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, platelet count of 303 K/uL, sodium of 125 mEq/L, potassium of 5.5 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen of 45 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 127 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal a large pancreatic mass with liver metastasis, new areas of peritoneal thickening along the left hemidiaphragm, infiltration of the mesentery, and diffuse omental caking suggesting peritoneal carcinomatosis. There is also a partial thrombosis of the left portal vein.

The patient's current plan includes nasogastric tube placement for nausea and vomiting, symptomatic control with antiemetics, pain management with opioids, and therapeutic drainage of ascites for comfort. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI), and she is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

1. Small bowel obstruction (SBO) due to peritoneal carcinomatosis or extrinsic compression from the pancreatic mass.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) given the elevated white blood cell count in the peritoneal fluid and recent catheter placement.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, or prerenal causes.
4. Hyponatremia that may worsen if not carefully managed.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization or malignancy-related hypercoagulable state.
6. Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Constipation"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 67-year-old female with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. She presents with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and an inability to tolerate oral intake. The patient also has hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's inability to tolerate oral intake may be due to profound ileus from medications, small bowel obstruction (SBO), or peritoneal carcinomatosis. Other differential diagnoses include constipation and extrinsic compression of the upper gastrointestinal tract by the pancreatic mass.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has an elevated potassium level, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. Treatment includes administering calcium gluconate, insulin with dextrose, and Kayexalate to lower potassium levels.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which can cause confusion, seizures, and muscle cramps. Treatment involves correcting fluid balance and electrolyte imbalances with normal saline (NS) infusion.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. This can be caused by prerenal factors such as dehydration or intrinsic renal injury. Management includes correcting fluid status, stopping nephrotoxic medications, and adjusting renal dosing of medications.

5. Peritonitis: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yof advanced stage IV pancreatic cancer now with nausea and
   vomiting, poor PO tolerance, and fatigue, found to have hyponatremia,
   hyerkalemia, and ARF.
   NAUSEA VOMITTING
 likely multifactorial, including medications
   (narcotics, antibiotics), hyponatremia, and possible abdominal
   infection (recent instrumentation).  Evaluation in progress.  Desire to
   feed (to minimize risk for bacterial tranlocation).  Hopefully nausea
   will improve as serum Na normalizes and SBP improves.
   HYPONATREMIA
 Improved.  likely dehydration, and net sodium loss.
   Possible SIADH, but good response to NS.  Continue NS, monitor Na, and
   if continues to correct, may be able to transfer to medicine floor.
   ABD PAIN
 Suspect SBP on back ground of progressive intraperitoneal
   carcinomatosis.  Await evaluation of ascites fluid to assess for SBP.
   Review and compare current CT with recent CT..
   SBP
 possibly related to abdominal drain placement.  Continue
   empirical antimicrobials, adjust according to culture results.
   Consider drainage on regular regimen.  Monitor.
   LEFT FOOT ERYTHEMA -- Intiail concern for cellulitis, but much
   improved.
   PANCREATIC CA -- Stage IV,  s/p Palliative chemoRx, now planning
   transition to hospice care.
   HYPERKALEMIA
 likely due to ARF.   s/p calcium, kayexylate,
   insulin/D50 in ED
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
 likely hypovolemia --> improved with hydration.
   Monitor BUN, creatinine while resussitating with fluids.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 encourage PO as tolerated.
   h/o PE -- Adjust lovenox dose for renal failure.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with advanced stage IV pancreatic cancer. The patient has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), and acute renal failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Seizures: Hyponatremia can lead to seizures due to the imbalance of electrolytes in the body.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: Both hyponatremia and hyperkalemia can disrupt the normal electrical activity of the heart, leading to arrhythmias.
3. Kidney damage: Acute renal failure can further impair kidney function and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to cancer and the use of immunosuppressive medications may increase the risk of infections, especially with the recent instrumentation and possible abdominal infection.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's overall critical condition may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, electrolyte levels, renal function, and nutritional status while providing appropriate supportive care and managing any potential complications that may arise."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with advanced stage IV pancreatic cancer, experiencing nausea, vomiting, poor oral tolerance, fatigue, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU and receiving intravenous normal saline (NS). The patient has a history of multiple antibiotic treatments, including ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and ciprofloxacin. He also has an indwelling port, central venous catheter, and arterial line.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, which need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing ARF, likely due to hypovolemia. It is important to monitor his renal function and provide appropriate fluid resuscitation to prevent worsening of renal function.

3. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of an abdominal drain, there is a risk of infection, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Evaluation of ascites fluid and monitoring of vital signs are essential to detect any signs of infection.

4. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient's poor oral tolerance and ongoing nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration and malnutrition. Nutritional support should be provided, and medications that contribute"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. She has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate oral intake, and fatigue for the past four days. The patient's laboratory results indicate hyponatremia (low sodium levels), hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), and acute renal insufficiency.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Nausea and vomiting: The most likely etiology is profound ileus from medications, SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), carcinomatosis, or incomplete small bowel obstruction. The patient has a history of thrush but her complaint does not appear to be a primary esophageal one. Other differential diagnoses include SBP as elevated WBC count in peritoneal fluid (73% polys) peritonitis, primary or secondary, especially given recent catheter placement and elevated WBC count.

2. SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion): The patient has hyponatremia, which is consistent with SIADH. Fluid restriction should continue.

3. Stage IV pancreatic cancer: The patient is receiving palliative chemotherapy but recent decisions have been made to move towards hospice care as an outpatient. The oncologist will consult as needed.

4. Hyperkalemia: This has resolved, but potassium levels should be trended daily.

5. Hyponatremia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with stage 4 pancreatic cancer who has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and fatigue for the past four days. She was found to have hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal insufficiency. The patient's recent medical history includes thrush, constipation, and a history of deep vein thrombosis. She is currently on palliative chemotherapy and has recently decided to move towards hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nausea and vomiting: The patient is experiencing profound ileus, which can be caused by medications, SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), carcinomatosis, or incomplete small bowel obstruction (SBO). It is important to monitor for signs of esophageal involvement and consider an upper gastrointestinal tract evaluation.
2. SBP: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count in the peritoneal fluid, indicating a possible infection. Treatment with IV ceftriaxone has been initiated to cover both SBP and catheter-related infection.
3. Stage IV pancreatic cancer: The patient is currently receiving palliative chemotherapy but has recently decided to transition to hospice care. Outpatient oncology consultation will be arranged.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, and she has received treatment with calcium, kayexylate, and insulin/D50 in the emergency department. Close monitoring of potassium levels and re"

   Assessment and Plan
   67F with stage 4 pancreatic cancer now p/w 4 days of nausea and
   vomiting, inabaility to tolerate po, and fatigue, found to have
   hyponatremia, hyerkalemia, and acute renal insufficiency
   .
   #. Nausea and vomiting - most likely etiology is profound ileus from
   meds, SBP, carcinomatosis, vs incomplete SBO, constipation, massive
   ascites, vs. extrinsic compresison of mass into UGI tract. Pt with
   recent thrush but her complaint does not appear a primary esophageal
   one. Other DDx includes SBP as elevated WBC count in peritoneal fluid
   (73% polys) peritonitis, primary or secondary, esp given recent
   catheter placement and elevated WBC count. Has been deemed an
   unacceptable risk for surgical pallliation.
   -- advance diet to sips, ADAT consider NGT if e/o SBO (not seen on CT
   scan)
   -- symptomatic control with zofran, compazine, ativan
   -- pain control with prn dilaudid and fentanyl patch
   -- f/u micro data; urine and blood cultures
   #. [**Name (NI) 9741**] unclear if peritoneal fluid is infection from SBP or
   from pleurex catheter; at any rate, treatment with IV Ceftriaxone
   should be sufficient to cover the [**Name (NI) 7260**] from SBP and the GPCs from
   catheter-related infection.
   -- increase IV CTX to 2gm daily (as per SBP tx)
   -- d/c cipro and flagyl
   -- f/u pending culture data
   .
   #. Stage IV pancreatic Cancer - has been on palliative chemo with
   recent decision to move towards hospice care as an outpatient.
   -- contact outpatient onc Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9717**]/[**Doctor Last Name 2998**]
   -- is well known to palliative care, team, will consult as inpatient
   -- therapeutic drainage of ascites for comfort
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - s/p calcium, kayexylate, insulin/D50 in ED
   -- trend K [**Hospital1 **]
   -- recheck EKG now
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - likely hypovolemic given n/v, ketonuria, urine SG,
   and ARF. No e/o MS changes. Was 129 on d/c on [**11-29**].
   -- check urine lytes, osms
   -- continue IV NS maintenance
   -- give 500cc IV NS bolus, recheck Na
   -- q6h sodiums, goal to increase 0.5 mEq/hr
   .
   # ARF - Cr. 1.4 from 1.0, likely prerenal
   -- check urine lytes, osms, eos
   -- IVF
   -- trend Cr
   -- renally dose meds
   .
   #. recent thrush - no evidence of this currently
   -- oral nystatin prn
   .
   # constipation -
   -- [**Hospital1 **] standing colace and senna
   -- add daily miralax
   -- add [**Hospital1 **] lactulose

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. She presents with nausea and vomiting, inability to tolerate oral intake, and fatigue. She also has hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal insufficiency. 

The patient's symptoms are likely due to a combination of factors including profound ileus from medications, spinal cord compression, carcinomatosis, or incomplete small bowel obstruction. The elevated white blood cell count in the peritoneal fluid suggests possible peritonitis, either primary or secondary. 

The plan includes advancing her diet to sips, considering the placement of a nasogastric tube if there is evidence of small bowel obstruction. Symptomatic control will be achieved with antiemetics and pain relief. 

Regarding her infection, it is unclear whether the peritoneal fluid is infected from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or from a pleurex catheter-related infection. However, treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone should cover both possibilities. The dosage of ceftriaxone will be increased to 2 grams daily. 

The patient has stage IV pancreatic cancer and has been on palliative chemotherapy. The decision has been made to transition towards hospice care. 

She also has hyperkalemia, which has been treated with calcium, kayexylate, and insulin/D50 in the emergency department. 

Additionally, the patient has hyponatremia, likely due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yof advanced stage IV pancreatic cancer now with nausea and
   vomiting, poor PO tolerance, and fatigue, found to have hyponatremia,
   hyerkalemia, and ARF.
   NAUSEA VOMITTING
 likely multifactorial, including medications
   (narcotics, antibiotics), hyponatremia, and possible abdominal
   infection (recent instrumentation).  Evaluation in progress.  Desire to
   feed (to minimize risk for bacterial tranlocation).  Hopefully nausea
   will improve as serum Na normalizes and SBP improves.
   HYPONATREMIA
 Overall clinically improved, although Na remains low.
   Likely SIADH, wit component of significant dehydration, and net sodium
   loss.  Consider continued net fluid restriction, but may require iv NS
   fluid bolus for low urine output or hypotension.  Consider Renal
   consultation to assist in fluid management.  Monitor Na
 will likely
   tolerate low Na.
   ABD PAIN
 Suspect SBP on back ground of progressive intraperitoneal
   carcinomatosis.  Await evaluation of ascites fluid to assess for SBP.
   Review and compare current CT with recent CT..
   SBP
 possibly related to abdominal drain placement.  Continue
   empirical antimicrobials, adjust according to culture results.
   Consider drainage on regular regimen.  Monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with advanced stage IV pancreatic cancer. The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, poor tolerance of oral medications, fatigue, and is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been found to have hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure.

The patient's nausea and vomiting are likely multifactorial, including medications (narcotics, antibiotics), hyponatremia, and possible abdominal infection due to recent instrumentation. The patient desires to feed to minimize the risk of bacterial translocation. Hopefully, the patient's symptoms will improve as serum sodium normalizes and systolic blood pressure improves.

The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) with a component of significant dehydration and net sodium loss. Continued net fluid restriction may be required, but intravenous normal saline fluid bolus may be necessary for low urine output or hypotension. Renal consultation should be considered to assist in fluid management. The patient is expected to tolerate low sodium levels.

The patient's abdominal pain is suspected to be secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) on the background of progressive intraperitoneal carcinomatosis. Evaluation of ascites fluid should be done to assess for SBP. Comparison with recent computed tomography (CT) scans should be reviewed. SBP may be related to abdominal drain placement.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yof advanced stage IV pancreatic cancer now with nausea and
   vomiting, poor PO tolerance, and fatigue, found to have hyponatremia,
   hyerkalemia, and ARF.
   NAUSEA VOMITTING
 likely multifactorial, including medications
   (narcotics, antibiotics), hyponatremia, and possible abdominal
   infection (recent instrumentation).  Evaluation in progress.  Desire to
   feed (to minimize risk for bacterial tranlocation).  Hopefully nausea
   will improve as serum Na normalizes and SBP improves.
   HYPONATREMIA
 Overall improved.  Likely SIADH, wit component of
   significant dehydration, and net sodium loss.  Consider continued net
   fluid restriction, but may require iv NS fluid bolus for low urine
   output or hypotension.  Consider Renal consultation to assist in fluid
   management.  Monitor Na.
   ABD PAIN
 Suspect SBP on back ground of progressive intraperitoneal
   carcinomatosis.  Await evaluation of ascites fluid to assess for SBP.
   Review and compare current CT with recent CT..
   SBP
 possibly related to abdominal drain placement.  Continue
   empirical antimicrobials, adjust according to culture results.
   Consider drainage on regular regimen.  Monitor.
   LEFT FOOT ERYTHEMA -- Much improved, with variable exam ?related to
   malignancy.
   PANCREATIC CA -- Stage IV,  s/p Palliative chemoRx, now planning
   transition to hospice care.
   HYPERKALEMIA
 likely due to ARF.   s/p calcium, kayexylate,

The patient is a 67-year-old male with advanced stage IV pancreatic cancer. He is currently experiencing nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of poor oral intake tolerance and is unable to stand. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101-117/80-84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 99%, and temperature within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, normal-sized pupils, no conjunctival pallor or edema, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, distended with right-sided percutaneous abdominal drain, edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show hyponatremia (sodium level of 108 mg/dL), hyperkalemia (potassium level of 5.8 mEq/L), elevated white blood cell count (34.8 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (36.5%), and elevated platelet count (286 K/uL). Other lab values are within normal limits.
