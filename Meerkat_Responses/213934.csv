   Reports:
   CXR Today
   FINDINGS: The heart is mildly increased in size. There are bilateral
   pleural
   effusions. There is hazy bilateral vasculature with pulmonary vascular
   redistribution.
   IMPRESSION: CHF.
   .
   Transthoracic Echocardiogram:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
   moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %). The number
   of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   .
   EKG:
   Sinus tachycardia, left axis deviation, TWI in I, aVL, V5-V6 (new as
   compared to prior), poor R wave progression, <0.5 ST depression in I,
   aVL, possibly V5-V6
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 35 year old female with history of SLE and restrictive
   lung disease who is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further management of
   new CHF in the setting of intra-uterine fetal demise detected today.
   .
   # Shortness of breath: Based on clinical examination with bibasilar
   rales, chest x-ray with enlarged cardiac sillohuette and pleural
   effusions, and echocardiogram with EF 30%, fits picture of new systolic
   heart failure. Etiology is not entirely clear, as no dilation seen
   (dilated cardiomyopathy of pregnancy), less likely ischemic in this
   young female, no classically associated with Lupus flare. No report of
   significant stressors prior to news of IUFD this AM to suspect
   Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy. Her renal function appears stable based on
   creatinine, and although she has proteinuria, it does not appear to be
   significantly worse as compared to the last several weeks, making
   nephrotic syndome less likely the etiology of her fluid overloaded
   state. Recent use of steriods likely contributed at least some degree
   to fluid retention, but would not explain depressed EF.
   .
   Best way to put together her presentation is likely subtle asymptomatic
   decline in her EF since [**2177**] (possibly due to SLE), with possible
   diastolic component from HTN, and in setting of worsening hypertension
   coupled with increased fluid retention (both due to steroids and
   pregnancy) with increased circulating volume due to 2^nd trimester
   pregnancy unmasked worsening EF and led to decompensation. EF of 30%
   may represent acute worsening from baseline in setting of
   decompensation versus new baseline (last echo in our system was
   3/[**2177**]). Tachycardia today and acute stress of IUFD further worsened
   picture with less time for filling in diastole. Now has 2+ MR as well,
   so would likely benefit from afterload reduction (eg ACE-I for
   proteinuria as well) once fluid status and renal function stable.
   .
   Her underlying restrictive disease is also likely contributing along
   with increased pressure on the diaphragm due to gravid uterus.  HIV
   negative 6/[**2179**]. Other potential etiologies include secondary to SLE or
   medication effect (rare effect of plaquenil)
   - Follow up final cardiac echocardiogram read
   - Continue diuresis with 10 mg IV lasix bolus, as she has had good
   output to first dose and feels subjectively better already with nearly
   400cc of urine out
   - Strict I/O's, goal net out at least 1 L as tolerated by creatinine
   and blood pressure; holding other BP medications for now to leave room
   for diuresis
   - Monitor potassium, repleting and monitoring magnesium
   - Investigate potential etiologies: TSH within normal limits, has been
   on multivitamin making beriberi very unlikely
   - Follow U/A and proteinuria
   - D&E tomorrow should also help fluid status by decreasing uterine
   blood flow and thus eventually reduce circulating intravascular volume
   - BNP and CK, troponin pending
   - Follow up PM creatinine to ensure she tolerates diuresis
   - Discussed with cardiology team who agrees with diuresis as first
   step, formal consult in AM
   .
   # Fetal demise: Unfortunately noted incidentially today during
   evalution. Patient has been seen by social work and currently has good
   support available from her husband and sister. She had significant
   pre-pregnancy counseling about the high risk nature of this pregnancy.
   Work-up for etiology of demise per OB/GYN and rheumatology team
   - D&E planned for tomorrow under general anesthesia
   - Appreciate OB/GYN assistance with management
   - Per OB/GYN team discussion with resident and attending, they would
   recommend holding antibiotics at this time unless patient has rupture
   of membranes--at that time would then start regimen of amp/gent/clinda
   or amp/erythromycin
   - Patient has active type and screen, NPO at midnight
   - 2nd large bore IV to be placed
   - Monitor coagulation factors, CBC, electrolytes, LFTs q8h
   .
   # SLE: Patient followed by rheumatoloy at [**Hospital1 183**] and was seen by
   rheumatology team as a consult today. Her creatinine is stable.
   - Appreciate rheumatology recommendations
   - Continuing stress dose steroids for now surrounding her D&E, however
   would like to decrease dose as soon as possible, as want to minimize
   fluid retention
   - Continue home medications as recommended
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Has been attributed to her SLE. Currently stable
   and actually improved from this AM.
   - Continue to monitor closely, has active type in event she develops
   bleeding or plt count drops <60
   .
   # Anemia: Suspect both of chronic disease secondary to SLE as well as
   physiologic of pregnancy.
   - Continue to monitor, currently stable.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Suspect both reactive to stress of IUFD as well as
   recent steroid taper.
   - Continue to monitor, low threshold to culture and initiate
   antibiotics should she demonstrate any signs of infection or
   hemodynamic decline
   .
   # Gastritis: Continue PPI
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Mildly elevated anion gap. Suspect largely due to
   elevated BUN. Will continue to monitor. Checking albumin to further
   assess gap.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of SLE and restrictive lung disease.
- She is admitted to the ICU for new-onset congestive heart failure (CHF) in the setting of intrauterine fetal demise.
- The patient's shortness of breath is consistent with new systolic heart failure, but the exact etiology is unclear.
- She has subtle asymptomatic decline in ejection fraction (EF) since [**2177**] (possibly due to SLE), with possible diastolic component from hypertension, and worsening fluid retention (due to steroids and pregnancy) unmasked worsening EF leading to decompensation.
- The patient also has moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis, moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function, and moderate mitral regurgitation.
- Other potential etiologies include secondary to SLE or medication effect (rare effect of plaquenil).
- The patient has been on stress dose steroids for her D&E and would like to decrease the dose as soon as possible to minimize fluid retention.
- She is also being treated for thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukocytosis, and gastritis.
- The patient's renal function appears stable, and her blood pressure is being closely monitored.
- The patient is on strict input/output monitoring, with a goal net output of at least 1 L as tolerated by creatinine and blood pressure.
- She will continue"

   - Discussed with cardiology team who agrees with diuresis as first
   step, formal consult in AM
   .
   # Fetal demise: Unfortunately noted incidentally today during
   evaluation. Patient has been seen by social work and currently has good
   support available from her husband and sister. She had significant
   pre-pregnancy counseling about the high risk nature of this pregnancy.
   Work-up for etiology of demise per OB/GYN and rheumatology team
   - D&E planned for possibly today under general anesthesia
   - Appreciate OB/GYN assistance with management
   - Per OB/GYN team discussion with resident and attending, they would
   recommend holding antibiotics at this time unless patient has rupture
   of membranes--at that time would then start regimen of amp/gent/clinda
   or amp/erythromycin
   - Patient has active type and screen, NPO
   - 2nd large bore IV placed
   - Monitor coagulation factors, CBC, electrolytes, LFTs q8h
   .
   # SLE: Patient followed by rheumatoloy at [**Hospital1 183**] and was seen by
   rheumatology team as a consult today. Her creatinine is stable.
   - Appreciate rheumatology recommendations
   - Continuing stress dose steroids for now surrounding her D&E, however
   would like to decrease dose as soon as possible, as want to minimize
   fluid retention
   - Continue home medications as recommended
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Has been attributed to her SLE. Currently stable
   and actually improved from this AM.
   - Continue to monitor closely, has active type in event she develops
   bleeding or plt count drops <60
   .
   # Anemia: Suspect both of chronic disease secondary to SLE as well as
   physiologic of pregnancy.
   - Continue to monitor, currently stable.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Suspect both reactive to stress of IUFD as well as
   recent steroid taper.
   - Continue to monitor, low threshold to culture and initiate
   antibiotics should she demonstrate any signs of infection or
   hemodynamic decline
   .
   # Gastritis: Continue PPI
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Resolved. Will continue to monitor.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of SLE and restrictive lung disease.
- She was transferred to the ICU for further management of new CHF in the setting of intra-uterine fetal demise detected today.
- The patient's symptoms include shortness of breath, bibasilar rales, chest x-ray showing an enlarged cardiac silhouette and pleural effusions, and an echocardiogram with EF 30%.
- The etiology of her CHF is not entirely clear, as no dilation was seen (dilated cardiomyopathy of pregnancy), less likely ischemic in this young female, no classically associated with Lupus flare, and no report of significant stressors prior to the news of IUFD.
- Her renal function appears stable based on creatinine, and although she has proteinuria, it does not appear to be significantly worse as compared to the last several weeks, making nephrotic syndrome less likely the etiology of her fluid overloaded state.
- Recent use of steroids likely contributed at least some degree to fluid retention, but would not explain depressed EF.
- The patient's underlying restrictive disease is also likely contributing along with increased pressure on the diaphragm due to the gravid uterus.
- Potential etiologies include secondary to SLE or medication effect (rare effect of plaquenil).
- Follow-up final cardiac echocardiogram read, continue diuresis with 10 mg IV lasix"

 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE:  Diuresed overnight.  I/0
   -   negative about half a liter since midnight.  Clinically improved,
   CXR improved albeit given supine AP film difficult to know if she has
   residual effusion layering up.  Still with dullness to percussion right
   base, fine crackles < [**11-21**] way up.  To give repeat dose of 10 mg IV
   lasix this am.  Cardiolgy to evaluate this am.  Monitor K/Mg with
   diruesis.
 PREGNANCY WITH FETAL DEMISE:  Followed by OB service.  They discussed
   options with patient this morning relative to going through L & D vs.
   scheduled D & E.  Patient and husband weighing decision.  Continued
   stress dose steroids overnight, received last dose of hydrocrotisone ~
   2 am. Will discuss need for fruther dosing with OB.
 SLE:  Received stress dose steroids overnight. Hold
   methylprednisolone on hydrocortisone.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  An issue in the past requiring intermittent
   steroids.  Platelet count remains greater than 120.
 RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: Slight bump in creatinine in setting of diuresis
   overnight.  Given she had clinically improved did not feel the need to
   push further given she has underlying SLE and dcoumented proteinurial.
 ANXIETY:  Seems less anxious this am albeit still see HR increase
   when family or staff enter patient's room.  Monitor need for
   axiolytics.

   STUDIES:

   Echo Final: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with relatively
   preserved contraction in the basal segments. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate global hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-1-15**], left
   ventricular systolic function is now more impaired and the ventricle is
   more dilated. The severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 35 year old female with history of SLE and restrictive
   lung disease who is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further management of
   new CHF in the setting of intra-uterine fetal demise detected today.
   .
   # Shortness of breath: Based on clinical examination with bibasilar
   rales, chest x-ray with enlarged cardiac silhouette and pleural
   effusions, and echocardiogram with EF 30%, fits picture of new systolic
   heart failure. Etiology is not entirely clear, as no dilation seen
   (dilated cardiomyopathy of pregnancy), less likely ischemic in this
   young female, no classically associated with Lupus flare. No report of
   significant stressors prior to news of IUFD this AM to suspect
   Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy. Her renal function appears stable based on
   creatinine, and although she has proteinuria, it does not appear to be
   significantly worse as compared to the last several weeks, making
   nephrotic syndrome less likely the etiology of her fluid overloaded
   state. Recent use of steroids likely contributed at least some degree
   to fluid retention, but would not explain depressed EF.

   Best way to put together her presentation is likely subtle asymptomatic
   decline in her EF since [**2177**] (possibly due to SLE), with possible
   diastolic component from HTN, and in setting of worsening hypertension
   coupled with increased fluid retention (both due to steroids and
   pregnancy) with increased circulating volume due to 2^nd trimester
   pregnancy unmasked worsening EF and led to decompensation. EF of 30%
   may represent acute worsening from baseline in setting of
   decompensation versus new baseline (last echo in our system was
   3/[**2177**]). Tachycardia today and acute stress of IUFD further worsened
   picture with less time for filling in diastole. Now has 2+ MR as well,
   so would likely benefit from afterload reduction (eg ACE-I for
   proteinuria as well) once fluid status and renal function stable.
   .
   Her underlying restrictive disease is also likely contributing along
   with increased pressure on the diaphragm due to gravid uterus.  HIV
   negative 6/[**2179**]. Other potential etiologies include secondary to SLE or
   medication effect (rare effect of plaquenil)
   - Follow up final cardiac echocardiogram read
   - Continue diuresis with 10 mg IV lasix bolus, as she has had good
   output to first dose and feels subjectively better already with nearly
   400cc of urine out
   - Strict I/O's, goal net out at least 1 L as tolerated by creatinine
   and blood pressure; holding other BP medications for now to leave room
   for diuresis
   - Monitor potassium, repleting and monitoring magnesium
   - Investigate potential etiologies: TSH within normal limits, has been
   on multivitamin making beriberi very unlikely
   - Follow U/A and proteinuria
   - D&E possibly today should also help fluid status by decreasing
   uterine blood flow and thus eventually reduce circulating intravascular
   volume
   - Follow up with creatinine to ensure she tolerates diuresis
   - Discussed with cardiology team who agrees with diuresis as first
   step, formal consult in AM
   .
   # Fetal demise: Unfortunately noted incidentally today during
   evaluation. Patient has been seen by social work and currently has good
   support available from her husband and sister. She had significant
   pre-pregnancy counseling about the high risk nature of this pregnancy.
   Work-up for etiology of demise per OB/GYN and rheumatology team
   - D&E planned for possibly today under general anesthesia
   - Appreciate OB/GYN assistance with management
   - Per OB/GYN team discussion with resident and attending, they would
   recommend holding antibiotics at this time unless patient has rupture
   of membranes--at that time would then start regimen of amp/gent/clinda
   or amp/erythromycin
   - Patient has active type and screen, NPO
   - 2nd large bore IV placed
   - Monitor coagulation factors, CBC, electrolytes, LFTs q8h
   .
   # SLE: Patient followed by rheumatoloy at [**Hospital1 183**] and was seen by
   rheumatology team as a consult today. Her creatinine is stable.
   - Appreciate rheumatology recommendations
   - Continuing stress dose steroids for now surrounding her D&E, however
   would like to decrease dose as soon as possible, as want to minimize
   fluid retention
   - Continue home medications as recommended
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Has been attributed to her SLE. Currently stable
   and actually improved from this AM.
   - Continue to monitor closely, has active type in event she develops
   bleeding or plt count drops <60
   .
   # Anemia: Suspect both of chronic disease secondary to SLE as well as
   physiologic of pregnancy.
   - Continue to monitor, currently stable.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Suspect both reactive to stress of IUFD as well as
   recent steroid taper.
   - Continue to monitor, low threshold to culture and initiate
   antibiotics should she demonstrate any signs of infection or
   hemodynamic decline

   # Gastritis: Continue PPI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of SLE and restrictive lung disease who was admitted to the ICU for new-onset CHF in the setting of intrauterine fetal demise. She has been diagnosed with moderate global hypokinesis and moderate mitral regurgitation based on an echocardiogram. Her left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 30-35%, indicating moderately depressed systolic function. The patient's renal function appears stable, but she has proteinuria. She has been on stress dose steroids, which may have contributed to fluid retention.

The patient's presentation suggests a subtle asymptomatic decline in her EF since last year, possibly due to SLE, with a possible diastolic component from hypertension. The worsening hypertension, coupled with increased fluid retention (due to steroids and pregnancy) and increased circulating volume due to 2nd trimester pregnancy, has unmasked worsening EF and led to decompensation. The patient also has bibasilar rales on lung examination, an enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest x-ray, and an echocardiogram showing moderate mitral regurgitation.

The patient is currently on diuretics, with a goal of net outputting at least 1 L as tolerated by creatinine and blood pressure. Her potassium levels will be monitored, and magnesium will be repleted as necessary. Potential etiologies for her condition, such as secondary to SLE or medication effect, are being investigated.

   Echo Final: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with relatively
   preserved contraction in the basal segments. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate global hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-1-15**], left
   ventricular systolic function is now more impaired and the ventricle is
   more dilated. The severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 35 year old female with history of SLE and restrictive
   lung disease who is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further management of
   new CHF in the setting of intra-uterine fetal demise detected today.
   .
# Shortness of breath: Presenting with new-onset systolic heart failure with EF
of 30-35%.  Most likely due to renal insufficiency and SLE flare in the setting
of pregnancy and fetal demise, which may havecontributed to cardiovascular dysfu
nction because of the release of inflammatory, vasodilatory cytokines.  Etiology
 is not entirely clear, as no dilation seen (dilated cardiomyopathy of pregnancy
), less likely ischemic in this young female, no classically associated with Lup
us flare. No report of significant stressors prior to news of IUFD this AM to [**Doctor First Name **]
spect Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy. Her renal function appears stable based on cre
atinine, and although she has proteinuria, it does not appear to be significantl
y worse as compared to the last several weeks, making nephrotic syndrome less li
kely the etiology of her fluid overloaded state. Recent use of steroids likely c
ontributed at least some degree to fluid retention, but would not explain depres
sed EF.  Now has 2+ MR as well, so would likely benefit from afterload reduction
 (eg ACE-I for proteinuria as well) once fluid status and renal function stable.
 Her underlying restrictive disease is also likely contributing.

","The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and restrictive lung disease. She was admitted to the ICU for management of new congestive heart failure (CHF) in the setting of intrauterine fetal demise. 

Summary:
- The patient has moderate global hypokinesis and moderate mitral regurgitation based on the echocardiogram results.
- She is experiencing systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30-35%.
- Possible etiologies for her CHF include renal insufficiency, SLE flare during pregnancy, and fetal demise.
- Her renal function appears stable, but she has proteinuria.
- Recent use of steroids may have contributed to fluid retention.
- She also has underlying restrictive lung disease.
- She is currently receiving diuretics for fluid overload and will be monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening CHF: The patient's systolic heart failure may progress, leading to further fluid accumulation and respiratory compromise.
2. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal function should be monitored closely, as renal insufficiency could worsen due to the underlying SLE, pregnancy, or medications.
3. Infection: The patient is at an increased risk for infections due to her immunocompromised state from SLE and steroid use. Close monitoring for signs of infection is crucial.

   STUDIES:
   CXR today
   Echo Final: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with relatively
   preserved contraction in the basal segments. Overall left ventricular
   systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Moderate global hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-1-15**], left
   ventricular systolic function is now more impaired and the ventricle is
   more dilated. The severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 35 year old female with history of SLE and restrictive
   lung disease who is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further management of
   new CHF in the setting of intra-uterine fetal demise detected today.
   .
# Shortness of breath: Presenting with new-onset systolic heart failure with EF
of 30-35%.  Most likely due to renal insufficiency and SLE flare in the setting
of pregnancy and fetal demise, which may havecontributed to cardiovascular dysfu
nction because of the release of inflammatory, vasodilatory cytokines.  Etiology
 is not entirely clear, as no dilation seen (dilated cardiomyopathy of pregnancy
), less likely ischemic in this young female, no classically associated with Lup
us flare. No report of significant stressors prior to news of IUFD this AM to [**Doctor First Name **]
spect Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy. Her renal function appears stable based on cre
atinine, and although she has proteinuria, it does not appear to be significantl
y worse as compared to the last several weeks, making nephrotic syndrome less li
kely the etiology of her fluid overloaded state. Recent use of steroids likely c
ontributed at least some degree to fluid retention, but would not explain depres
sed EF.  Now has 2+ MR as well, so would likely benefit from afterload reduction
 (eg ACE-I for proteinuria as well) once fluid status and renal function stable.
 Her underlying restrictive disease is also likely contributing.
   - Strict I/O's, goal net out at least 1 L as tolerated by creatinine
   and blood pressure
   - Monitor potassium, repleting and monitoring magnesium
   - Investigate potential etiologies
   - Follow U/A and proteinuria
   - Add ACEI in setting of moderate MR
   - f/u with renal
   .
   # Fetal demise: Unfortunately noted incidentally today during
   evaluation. Patient has been seen by social work and currently has good
   support available from her husband and sister. She had significant
   pre-pregnancy counseling about the high risk nature of this pregnancy.
   Work-up for etiology of demise per OB/GYN and rheumatology team
   - Appreciate OB/GYN assistance with management
   - Per OB/GYN team discussion with resident and attending, they would
   recommend holding antibiotics at this time unless patient has rupture
   of membranes--at that time would then start regimen of amp/gent/clinda
   or amp/erythromycin
   - Patient has active type and screen, NPO
   - 2nd large bore IV placed
   - Monitor coagulation factors, CBC, electrolytes, LFTs q8h
   .
   # SLE: Patient followed by rheumatoloy at [**Hospital1 183**] and was seen by
   rheumatology team as a consult today. Her creatinine bumped from 1.1 to
   1.2.
   - Appreciate rheumatology recommendations
   - d/c stress dose steroids later today (24hr s/p procedure) and
   decrease to 60mg pred
   - Continue home medications as recommended
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Has been attributed to her SLE. Currently stable
   and actually improved from this AM.
   - Continue to monitor closely, has active type in event she develops
   bleeding or plt count drops <60
   .
   # Anemia: Suspect both of chronic disease secondary to SLE as well as
   physiologic of pregnancy.
   - Continue to monitor, currently stable with Hct at 30
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Suspect both reactive to stress of IUFD as well as
   recent steroid taper.
   - Continue to monitor, low threshold to culture and initiate
   antibiotics should she demonstrate any signs of infection or
   hemodynamic decline
   .
   # Gastritis: Continue PPI
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Resolved. Will continue to monitor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of SLE and restrictive lung disease who was transferred to the ICU for further management of new CHF in the setting of intra-uterine fetal demise. She presented with systolic heart failure and an ejection fraction of 30-35%. The etiology of her heart failure is not entirely clear, but it may be related to renal insufficiency, SLE flare, and possibly the release of inflammatory cytokines due to fetal demise. Other potential causes such as dilated cardiomyopathy of pregnancy, ischemic heart disease, or Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy are less likely. She has moderate global hypokinesis and moderate mitral regurgitation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has new-onset systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30-35%. This could be due to renal insufficiency and SLE flare in the setting of pregnancy and fetal demise.
2. Intra-Uterine Fetal Demise: The patient's fetus has unfortunately passed away. The cause of the fetal demise needs to be investigated.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is attributed to her SLE. This needs to be monitored closely.
4. Anemia: The patient is suspected to have anemia due to chronic disease secondary to SLE as well as physiologic changes of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-inch, 69.8 kg female with a chief complaint of congestive heart failure. She underwent a D & E procedure and tolerated it well, with minimal vaginal spotting. The patient received IV fluids and was hemodynamically stable overnight. She was also transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells postoperatively.

Review of systems shows fatigue, but no pain or genitourinary symptoms. Vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 106 bpm (93-124 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 112/86 mmHg to 128/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (15-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination reveals crackles at both lung bases, but no lower extremity edema. Neurological examination is not assessed due to the patient's intubation status. Laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.3 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 100 K/uL, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging shows poor inspiration and increased interstitial markings on chest X-ray.
