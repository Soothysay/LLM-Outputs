","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, including brain and cervical spine metastases. She was admitted to the ICU after falling at home and was found to have PCP pneumonia and hypoxia. She is currently on NC/FM oxygen alone and has stable O2 sats. The patient's lab results show an elevated WBC count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine, and various electrolyte imbalances. Imaging by CXR shows worsening, but a CTA was negative for PE. The patient is being treated with TMP/SMX DS q8h for PCP, dex 4 mg q8h for PCP (equivalent to 40 mg prednisone), and Levofloxacin as coverage for aspiration pneumonia. The patient is also experiencing weakness with proximal muscle weakness, likely steroid-induced myopathy. The brain and cervical spine MRI showed stable mets, and she is currently on irinotecan/bevacizumab for her ovarian cancer. Her hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine, and she is on PPI, heparin SC, and a bowel regimen for prophylaxis. The patient is on a regular diet with supplements and finger sticks while on steroids. Her disposition is ICU level of care for now, and she has a full code status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma and brain and cervical spine metastases. She presented to the ICU after a fall at home. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely due to Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), and is being treated with TMP/SMX DS and dexamethasone (dex). She also has weakness, possibly caused by steroid-induced myopathy, and is receiving symptomatic treatment. The patient has stable metastases on MRI and is on irinotecan/bevacizumab for ovarian cancer. She has hypothyroidism and is on levothyroxine. The patient requires prophylaxis for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is on a regular diet with supplements and finger stick glucose monitoring while on steroids. The patient is currently in the ICU and has a full code status.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is at risk for worsening hypoxia due to PCP, as indicated by her current hypoxia on ABG and previous positive PCP test.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's weakened state and possible aspiration could lead to aspiration pneumonia.
3. Steroid-induced myopathy: The patient's weakness may worsen due to prolonged steroid use for treating PCP.
4. Nutritional status: The patient's poor appetite and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of shortness of breath (SOB). They have been diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer and PJP. The patient is experiencing hypoxia and anemia. Oxygenation seems to be adequate with the current FiO2, but the patient becomes uncomfortable with minimal exertion. They are receiving ICU care, including nutrition support and glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has an indwelling port (PortaCath) for medication administration and is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's SOB and hypoxia indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure. Monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Infection: PJP and the use of indwelling lines increase the risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are essential.
3. Bleeding: Anemia and the use of anticoagulants (heparin) for DVT prophylaxis may increase the risk of bleeding. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and careful management of anticoagulation therapy are necessary.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The systolic murmur noted during the physical examination may indicate underlying cardiac pathology. Continuous cardiac monitoring and further evaluation may be needed to assess cardiovascular status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of metastatic ovarian cancer and PJP (presumably pulmonary involvement). They are currently experiencing hypoxia, anemia, and oxygenation difficulties. The patient is receiving steroid treatment and ICU care, including nutrition and glycemic control. They have an indwelling port for medication administration and are on prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygenation remains tenuous, indicating a potential risk of respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
2. Infection: Given the presence of an indwelling port and prolonged ICU stay, there is a risk of developing healthcare-associated infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or bloodstream infections.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures are in place, but the patient's critical illness and immobility increase the risk of developing DVT.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis, but there is still a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with the use of anticoagulant therapy.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level indicates a potential risk of renal dysfunction, which may be exacerbated by the patient's critical condition and medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma with
   brain and cervical spine metastases presented after fall at home
   transferred to ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia which appears worse by
   CXR. Increasing O2 requirement and increased work of breathing
   therefore patient was intubated. Currently doing well on AC with FIO2
   of 70%. Attempting to wean down FIO2.
   -          Continue AC
   -          Monitor ABG if changes to vent
   -          Continue abx for PCP
   #  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Has received one weeks of Bactrim treatment dose with
   minimal response. [**Month (only) 60**] need to change coverage to pentamidine. Will
   consult ID. Given hyponatremia, will change Bactrim to liquid PO via
   NG.
   - continue TMP/SMX DS q8h
   - continue dex 4 mg q8h  (equivalence to 40 mg prednisone [**Hospital1 **] for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **])
   - Monitor WBC, fever curve
   - Ck daily CXR
   # Hyponatremia: Urine osm and Urine sodium consistent with SIADH,
   likely secondary to her pulmonary process. Although, known brain mets
   can also cause SIADH.
   -          change bactrim to PO to minimize free water intake.
   -          recheck lytes to confirm Na is correct as drastic change
   from day prior
   -          treat with fluid restriction
   -          monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Weakness: with proximal muscle weakness, likely steroid-induced
   myopathy. ?worsening CNS involvement. Also in the setting of possible
   pneumonia. Telemetry unremarkable. Brain and C-spine MRI showed stable
   mets. Cannot wean off steroids yet due to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - symptomatic treatment, PT as tolerated once out of ICU
   - Nutritional status is poor given poor appetite, boost/supplements
   .
   # Ovarian cancer with CNS mets: stable mets on MRI. On
   irinotecan/bevacizumab.
   - continue steroids
   - chemo on hold in setting of acute illness
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, hep SC, bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN:  NPO, [**Hospital1 **] finger sticks while on steroids
   # Dispo: ICU level of care for now.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, brain and cervical spine metastases. She was transferred to the ICU for PCP pneumonia and hypoxia. The patient presented with no overnight events but became progressively more hypoxic during rounds, using accessory muscles.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 109/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a face tent with supplemental oxygen. The patient's ABG results indicate hypoxemia.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, and warm skin without rash. The patient is sedated and not oriented, with absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose, hyponatremia, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes hypoxia secondary to PCP pneumonia, which appears worse on chest X-ray. She was intubated and placed on assisted ventilation with FIO2 of 70%. The plan is to continue assisted ventilation and wean down the FIO2 as tolerated. Antibiotic coverage for PCP is continued, and consultation with Infectious Disease is requested"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, including brain and cervical spine metastases. She presented to the ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia after a fall at home. The patient has been receiving treatment for her conditions, including antibiotics, steroids, and chemotherapy. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/43 mmHg to 155/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is on respiratory support with a face tent and has clear breath sounds. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, and warm skin without rash. Her neurological assessment shows that she responds to tactile stimuli and is sedated. Laboratory results indicate stable kidney function, slightly elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxia likely due to PCP pneumonia. Although her oxygen saturation is currently stable, monitoring is necessary to ensure she maintains adequate oxygenation.

2. Pneumonia: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient's chest X-ray shows worsening pneumonia. Continued monitoring and treatment are required to prevent further deterioration.

3. Steroid-induced myopathy: The patient's weakness may be"

   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma with
   brain and cervical spine metastases presented after fall at home
   transferred to ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia which appears worse by
   CXR. Increasing O2 requirement and increased work of breathing
   therefore patient was intubated. Currently doing well on AC with FIO2
   of 60%.
   -          Continue AC
   -          Monitor ABG if changes to vent
   -          Continue pentamidine
   #  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Has received one weeks of Bactrim treatment dose with
   minimal response. [**Month (only) 60**] need to change coverage to pentamidine. Will
   consult ID. Given hyponatremia, will change Bactrim to liquid PO via
   NG.
   - continue Pentamidine, monitor LFTs
   - continue dex 4 mg q8h  (equivalence to 40 mg prednisone [**Hospital1 **] for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **])
   - Monitor WBC, fever curve
   - Ck daily CXR
   - F/U ID recs
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to sedation, PEEP. Requiring small doses
   of levophed.
   - Attempt to wean sedation
   - Wean pressors
   # Hyponatremia: Urine osm and Urine sodium consistent with SIADH,
   likely secondary to her pulmonary process. Although, known brain mets
   can also cause SIADH. Today serum Na 127
   -          continue fluid restriction as tolerated
   -          monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Weakness: with proximal muscle weakness, likely steroid-induced
   myopathy. ?worsening CNS involvement. Also in the setting of possible
   pneumonia. Telemetry unremarkable. Brain and C-spine MRI showed stable
   mets. Cannot wean off steroids yet due to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - symptomatic treatment, PT as tolerated once out of ICU
   - Nutritional status is poor given poor appetite, boost/supplements
   .
   # Ovarian cancer with CNS mets: stable mets on MRI. On
   irinotecan/bevacizumab.
   - continue steroids
   - chemo on hold in setting of acute illness
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, hep SC, bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN:  NPO, [**Hospital1 **] finger sticks while on steroids.
   - monitor another set of lytes to confirm serum sodium is stable
   - consult nutrition for recs
   - Autodiuresing while on pressors. Monitor BP, UO. Bolus as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, brain and cervical spine metastases, who presented to the ICU after experiencing a fall at home. She was transferred to the ICU due to PCP pneumonia and hypoxia. The patient was intubated and placed on assisted ventilation with a FiO2 of 60%. 

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely secondary to PCP pneumonia, which appears worse on the chest X-ray. The patient's increasing O2 requirement and increased work of breathing necessitated intubation. Continuous assisted ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% is being provided.

2. PCP Pneumonia: Despite receiving one week of Bactrim treatment, the patient has shown minimal response. As a result, the coverage for PCP pneumonia needs to be changed to pentamidine. The patient will be consulted with an Infectious Disease specialist. Bactrim will be administered in liquid form via nasogastric tube due to the patient's hyponatremia.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to sedation and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). The patient is requiring small doses of levophed.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has low serum sodium levels, which are consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, brain, and cervical spine metastases. She presented to the ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia after a fall at home. She was intubated due to worsening oxygenation and increased work of breathing. She is currently on pentamidine and steroids for PCP pneumonia. The patient has hypotension likely secondary to sedation and PEEP, requiring small doses of levophed.

The patient is on full code status and requires ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PCP pneumonia exacerbation: The patient's PCP pneumonia seems to be worsening, as indicated by the increasing O2 requirement and increased work of breathing. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to sedation and PEEP. It is essential to attempt to wean off sedation and monitor the patient's response to avoid excessive use of press"

   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma with
   brain and cervical spine metastases presented after fall at home
   transferred to ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia which appears worse by
   CXR. Increasing O2 requirement and increased work of breathing
   therefore patient was intubated. Currently doing well on AC with FIO2
   of 60%.
   -          Continue AC
   -          Monitor ABG if changes to vent
   -          Continue pentamidine
   #  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Has received one weeks of Bactrim treatment dose with
   minimal response. [**Month (only) 60**] need to change coverage to pentamidine. Will
   consult ID. Given hyponatremia, will change Bactrim to liquid PO via
   NG.
   - continue Pentamidine, monitor LFTs
   - continue dex 4 mg q8h  (equivalence to 40 mg prednisone [**Hospital1 **] for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **])
   - Monitor WBC, fever curve
   - Ck daily CXR
   - F/U ID recs
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to sedation, PEEP. Requiring small doses
   of levophed.
   - Attempt to wean sedation
   - Wean pressors
   # Hyponatremia: Urine osm and Urine sodium consistent with SIADH,
   likely secondary to her pulmonary process. Although, known brain mets
   can also cause SIADH. Today serum Na 127
   -          continue fluid restriction as tolerated
   -          monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Weakness: with proximal muscle weakness, likely steroid-induced
   myopathy. ?worsening CNS involvement. Also in the setting of possible
   pneumonia. Telemetry unremarkable. Brain and C-spine MRI showed stable
   mets. Cannot wean off steroids yet due to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - symptomatic treatment, PT as tolerated once out of ICU
   - Nutritional status is poor given poor appetite, boost/supplements
   # Ovarian cancer with CNS mets: stable mets on MRI. On
   irinotecan/bevacizumab.
   - continue steroids
   - chemo on hold in setting of acute illness
   # Leukopenia: add on diff and ANC.  Culture if spikes.  Neutropenic
   precauations if neutropenic.
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, hep SC, bowel regimen
   # FEN:  NPO, [**Hospital1 **] finger sticks while on steroids.
   - monitor another set of lytes to confirm serum sodium is stable
   - consult nutrition for recs
   - Autodiuresing while on pressors. Monitor BP, UO. Bolus as needed.
   # Dispo: ICU level of care for now.

","The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, brain, and cervical spine metastases. She presented to the ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia after falling at home. The patient has been intubated and is currently on assisted ventilation with a FiO2 of 60%. 

She has received one week of Bactrim treatment for her PCP pneumonia, but with minimal response. The ID team recommends changing coverage to pentamidine. Her hyponatremia may be due to SIADH, possibly secondary to her pulmonary process or worsening CNS involvement. Fluid restriction should continue as tolerated, and electrolytes should be monitored. 

The patient's weakness is likely steroid-induced myopathy, possibly worsening CNS involvement, or related to pneumonia. Telemetry is unremarkable, and brain and C-spine MRI showed stable mets. She cannot wean off steroids yet due to PCP.

Her ovarian cancer with CNS mets is stable on irinotecan/bevacizumab. Chemotherapy is on hold in the setting of acute illness. Leukopenia should be managed with a differential and ANC, and neutropenic precautions should be taken if neutropenic. Hypothyroidism should continue with levothyroxine.

The patient requires ICU level of care, and her code status is full code. Prophylactic measures include DVT prophylaxis with SQ UF Heparin, stress ulcer"

- Upon admission, she required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to worsening hypoxia.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues, including hypoxia, hypotension, hyponatremia, weakness, ovarian cancer with CNS metastases, leukopenia, and hypothyroidism.
- She has been receiving treatment for PCP pneumonia with pentamidine and steroids, as well as empiric coverage for febrile neutropenia.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F (38.6°C), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 96/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on FiO2 of 70%.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with an ANC of 700, hyponatremia, elevated LDH, and abnormal liver function tests.
- She is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, and anticoagulants.
- The patient's prognosis remains poor, and she requires ongoing ICU-level care.

   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma with
   brain and cervical spine metastases presented after fall at home
   transferred to ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia which appears worse by
   CXR.  Sats dropping overnight so increased PEEP and FIO2.
   -          Monitor ABG
   -          Continue PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
   #  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Currently on pentamidine and steroids per ID recs.
   - continue Pentamidine for now, monitor LFTs
   - Ck daily CXR to rule out PTX
   - F/U ID recs
   #Hypotension/ Shock: BPs have been worsening requiring increasing doses
   of pressors. Likely septic vs hypovolemic shock.
   - Attempt to wean sedation
   - Wean pressors
   #  Febrile neutropenia: ANC 1000 after starting on GCSF. On empiric
   ocverage for febrile neutropenia.
   -          neutropenic precautions
   -          cover with vanco and cefepime given lines
   -          continue abx for PCP
   # Hyponatremia: Sodium currently normal.
   -        monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Weakness: with proximal muscle weakness, likely steroid-induced
   myopathy. ?worsening CNS involvement. Also in the setting of possible
   pneumonia. Telemetry unremarkable. Brain and C-spine MRI showed stable
   mets. Cannot wean off steroids yet due to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
    - symptomatic treatment, PT as tolerated once out of ICU
   - Nutritional status is poor given poor appetite, boost/supplements
   # Ovarian cancer with CNS mets: stable mets on MRI. On
   irinotecan/bevacizumab- last dose 10 days ago.
   - continue steroids
   - chemo on hold in setting of acute illness
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, hep SC, bowel regimen
   # FEN:  Tube feeds, [**Hospital1 **] finger sticks while on steroids.
   # Dispo: ICU level of care for now.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, brain and cervical spine metastases. She presented to the ICU with community-acquired pneumonia (PCP pneumonia) and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications since her admission. 

1. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been dropping, indicating worsening respiratory function. This is likely secondary to PCP pneumonia, which appears worse on the chest X-ray. The plan is to monitor arterial blood gases (ABG) and continue with the current treatment for PCP pneumonia.

2. PCP [Name Initial (PRE)]: The patient is currently on pentamidine and steroids per ID recs. It is recommended to continue pentamidine and monitor liver function tests (LFTs). Daily chest X-rays should be done to rule out pneumothorax (PTX). Follow-up with ID recs is also advised.

3. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's blood pressures have been worsening, requiring increasing doses of pressors. This suggests the possibility of septic or hypovolemic shock. The plan is to attempt to wean sedation and gradually decrease the use of pressors.

4. Febrile neutropenia: The patient's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is 1000 after starting on G-CSF. She is on empirical coverage for febrile neutropenia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of metastatic ovarian malignancy, currently experiencing respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis infection and hypotension of unclear etiology. She is in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a fever, thrombocytopenia, oliguria, hyponatremia, weakness, neutropenia, and a history of ovarian malignancy. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids, and pentamidine for Pneumocystis treatment. The etiology of her shock is uncertain, and further evaluation is pending. The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The presence of multiple central lines increases the risk of CLABSI.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and malignancy increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of nosocomial infections.
5. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient's hypotension and fever suggest sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not promptly treated.
6. Acute kidney injury"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian malignancy who is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis infection and hypotension of unclear etiology. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with increased FiO2. The patient has a history of fever, oliguria, hyponatremia, weakness, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. She is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics and receiving fluids and vasopressors to maintain hemodynamic stability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of clinical signs and symptoms, as well as appropriate cultures, should be done to identify early if VAP develops.

2. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not adequately managed. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood pressure, and urine output is crucial. Prompt identification and treatment of the underlying infection are essential.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria and elevated creatinine levels suggest a possible AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary. If the patient's condition worsens, renal replacement therapy may be required.

4. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) progression: Although the patient is already receiving treatment for PCP"

   -          on pentamidine per ID
   Thrombocytopenia
   - likely multifactorial
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia which appears worse by
   CXR. Increasing O2 requirement and increased work of breathing
   therefore patient was intubated. Currently oxygenating well with FIO2
   of 60%.
   -          Continue AC
   -          Monitor ABG if changes to vent
   -          Continue pentamidine
   # oliguria
   #  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Currently on pentamidine and steroids per ID recs.
   - continue Pentamidine for now, monitor LFTs
   - Decrease dex  by half
   - Ck daily CXR
   - F/U ID recs
   #Hypotension: Likely secondary to sedation, PEEP. Requiring small doses
   of levophed.
   - Attempt to wean sedation
   - Wean pressors
   # Hyponatremia: Sodium currently normal.
   -        monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Weakness: with proximal muscle weakness, likely steroid-induced
   myopathy. ?worsening CNS involvement. Also in the setting of possible
   pneumonia. Telemetry unremarkable. Brain and C-spine MRI showed stable
   mets. Cannot wean off steroids yet due to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
   - symptomatic treatment, PT as tolerated once out of ICU
   - Nutritional status is poor given poor appetite, boost/supplements
   # Ovarian cancer with CNS mets: stable mets on MRI. On
   irinotecan/bevacizumab- last dose 10 days ago.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, brain and cervical spine metastases who presented to the ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia. She has respiratory failure, likely secondary to PCP pneumonia, septic shock, fever, thrombocytopenia, oliguria, weakness, and leukopenia. The patient's condition requires critical care support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, which can be a life-threatening condition if not managed properly. This may require mechanical ventilation and close monitoring of oxygenation.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is in septic shock, indicated by hypotension and the need for vasopressor support. This condition carries a high risk of mortality if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Infection: The presence of fever and leukopenia suggests an ongoing infection, which needs to be identified and treated appropriately. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have already been started, but specific identification of the causative organism is necessary.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications. Platelet transfusion may be required if the platelet count is dangerously low.
5. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is reduced, indicating possible renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
6. Hypoxia: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, brain, and cervical spine metastases. She was transferred to the ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia likely secondary to PCP pneumonia, 2+ GPCs on gram stain from sputum culture, and elevated stroke volume variation despite fluid boluses. She also has profuse diarrhea, hyponatremia, weakness, and proximal muscle weakness. The patient is on empiric antibiotics for PCP pneumonia and suspected C. diff infection, as well as caspofungin for fungal infection. She has been weaned off pressors and is being managed with IVF boluses for hypotension. The patient's nutritional status is poor, and she is receiving tube feeds. Her code status is full code, and she is currently on ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the presence of PCP pneumonia, the patient is at risk of worsening respiratory failure and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Infectious Complications: The patient's profuse diarrhea raises concerns for C. diff infection or antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Close monitoring of symptoms and stool cultures is necessary. The presence of 2+ GPCs in the sputum culture indicates a possible bacterial infection, which may require adjustment of the antibiotic regimen.

   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma with
   brain and cervical spine metastases presented after fall at home
   transferred to ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia.
    # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia which appears worse by
   CXR. Also with 2+ GPC on gram stain sputum culture. Sats dropping
   overnight so increased PEEP and FIO2 to 12 and 80 respectively.
   -          F/U Sputum culture
   -          Monitor ABG
   -          Continue PCP therapy
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]          Continue empiric antibiotic with broad spectrum antibiotics
   -           Daily CXR
   #  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Added caspofungin to regimen
   - continue Pentamidine, monitor LFTs
   - Ck daily CXR to rule out PTX
   - F/U ID recs
   - added caspofungin
   # COMA: Not responsive to pain. Concern for either intracranial bleed
   given thrombocytopenia. Also with known brain mets.
   - hold sedation
   - Stat Head CT
   #Hypotension/ Shock: Septic vs hypovolemic. Requiring pressors. Vitileo
   demonstrates elevated stroke volume variation despite numerous fluid
   boluses.
   -          IVF boluses for hypotension
   -          Continue empiric antibiotics
   #  Fevers: WBC 2.6 on GCSF. Profuse diarrhea concerning for c. diff vs
   antibiotic associated diarrhea. Also with 2+ GPCs in sputum. C diff
   toxin negative  x 2. Therefore likelihood of C diff infection is low.
   Also with other pulmonary source for fevers.
   -          cover with vanco and cefepime given lines
   -          continue abx for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]          If cultures negative, can begin to peel off abx.
   -          D/C flagyl for C. diff
   # Oliguric renal failure: minimal urine output with bump in creatinine
   from 0.6 to 1.  Could be prerenal vs ischemic ATN given hypotension.
   Also may be post renal failure [**12-22**] obstruction from knon ovarian CA.
   - send urine lytes
   - ck renal ultrasound
   - keep MAP greater than 60
   # Hyponatremia: Sodium currently normal.
   -        monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Weakness: with proximal muscle weakness, likely steroid-induced
   myopathy. ?worsening CNS involvement. Also in the setting of possible
   pneumonia. Telemetry unremarkable. Brain and C-spine MRI showed stable
   mets. Cannot wean off steroids yet due to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
    - symptomatic treatment, PT as tolerated once out of ICU
   - Nutritional status is poor given poor appetite, boost/supplements
   # Ovarian cancer with CNS mets: stable mets on MRI. On
   irinotecan/bevacizumab- last dose 10 days ago.
   - continue steroids
   - chemo on hold in setting of acute illness
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, hep SC, bowel regimen
   # FEN:  Tube feeds, [**Hospital1 **] finger sticks while on steroids.
   # Dispo: ICU level of care for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, brain, and cervical spine metastases. She presented to the ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia. The patient is currently unresponsive and on mechanical ventilation. She has been experiencing fever, tachypnea, and metabolic acidosis. Her laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and hyponatremia. The patient's recent fall at home led to her transfer to the ICU. She has multiple comorbidities, including hypothyroidism, ovarian cancer with CNS metastases, and possible C. diff infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxia is likely secondary to PCP pneumonia. The worsening condition may require further interventions such as increased PEEP and FiO2.
2. PCP Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia, and her symptoms are worsening despite treatment. It is essential to monitor ABG and follow-up with sputum culture.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be secondary to recent chemotherapy, pentamidine therapy, or other causes. Monitoring platelet count and investigating DIC labs is necessary.
4. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient has minimal urine output with an increase in creatinine, suggesting possible prerenal or"

   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma with
   brain and cervical spine metastases presented after fall at home
   transferred to ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia.
    # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia which appears worse by
   CXR. Also with 2+ GPC on gram stain sputum culture. Sats dropping
   overnight so increased PEEP and FIO2 to 12 and 80 respectively.
   -          F/U Sputum culture
   -          Monitor ABG
   -          Continue PCP therapy
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]          Continue empiric antibiotic with broad spectrum antibiotics
   -           Daily CXR
   #  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Added caspofungin to regimen
   - continue Pentamidine, monitor LFTs
   - Ck daily CXR to rule out PTX
   - F/U ID recs
   - added caspofungin
   # COMA: Not responsive to pain. Concern for either intracranial bleed
   given thrombocytopenia. Also with known brain mets.
   - hold sedation
   - Stat Head CT
   #Hypotension/ Shock: Septic vs hypovolemic. Requiring pressors. Vitileo
   demonstrates elevated stroke volume variation despite numerous fluid
   boluses.
   -          IVF boluses for hypotension
   -          Continue empiric antibiotics
   #  Fevers: WBC 2.6 on GCSF. Profuse diarrhea concerning for c. diff vs
   antibiotic associated diarrhea. Also with 2+ GPCs in sputum. C diff
   toxin negative  x 2. Therefore likelihood of C diff infection is low.
   Also with other pulmonary source for fevers.
   -          cover with vanco and cefepime given lines
   -          continue abx for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]          If cultures negative, can begin to peel off abx.
   -          D/C flagyl for C. diff
   # Oliguric renal failure: minimal urine output with bump in creatinine
   from 0.6 to 1.  Could be prerenal vs ischemic ATN given hypotension.
   Also may be post renal failure [**12-22**] obstruction from knon ovarian CA.
   - send urine lytes
   - ck renal ultrasound
   - keep MAP greater than 60
   # Hyponatremia: Sodium currently normal.
   -        monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Weakness: with proximal muscle weakness, likely steroid-induced
   myopathy. ?worsening CNS involvement. Also in the setting of possible
   pneumonia. Telemetry unremarkable. Brain and C-spine MRI showed stable
   mets. Cannot wean off steroids yet due to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
    - symptomatic treatment, PT as tolerated once out of ICU
   - Nutritional status is poor given poor appetite, boost/supplements
   # Ovarian cancer with CNS mets: stable mets on MRI. On
   irinotecan/bevacizumab- last dose 10 days ago.
   - continue steroids
   - chemo on hold in setting of acute illness
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, hep SC, bowel regimen
   # FEN:  Tube feeds, [**Hospital1 **] finger sticks while on steroids.
   # Dispo: ICU level of care for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, brain and cervical spine metastases, who presented to the ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia. She has been experiencing several medical complications including hypoxia, coma, hypotension, fever, oliguric renal failure, hyponatremia, weakness, hypothyroidism, and a history of ovarian cancer with CNS metastases. She has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, antifungals, steroids, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential respiratory distress or failure due to PCP pneumonia.
2. Coma: The patient's unresponsiveness to pain suggests a possible intracranial bleed, especially considering her thrombocytopenia and known brain metastases.
3. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's requirement for pressors and elevated stroke volume variation indicate potential septic or hypovolemic shock.
4. Fevers: The presence of profuse diarrhea and 2+ GPCs in sputum suggests the possibility of C. difficile infection or antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
5. Oliguric renal failure: The minimal urine output and increased creatinine level suggest acute kidney injury, which could be prerenal, ischemic ATN, or post-renal due to known ovarian cancer.
6. Hyponatremia: Although the patient's sodium levels are currently normal, monitoring is necessary as hyponatremia can develop due to various causes.
7. Weakness: The proximal muscle weakness may be attributed to steroid-induced myopathy or worsening CNS involvement.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient requires continued levothyroxine replacement therapy.
9. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving various prophylactic measures, including PPI, SC heparin, and bowel regimen.
10. Ovarian cancer with CNS metastases: The patient's stable brain and cervical spine metastases on MRI need ongoing management.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information or further evaluation may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian malignancy now with
   respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis, and hypotension of unclear
   etiology.
   Respiratory failure
   -          at least initially secondary to PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]          await final cultures before tailoring antibiotics for
   possible VAP
   Shock
   -          etiology uncertain at this point; likely septic
   -          continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   -          stop Flagyl given two negative C diff toxin assays
   -          fluid boluses for high stroke volume variation
   -          volume challenge with isotonic bicarb (given non-gap
   acidosis)
   Fever
   - Maintain on broad-spectrum ABX pending cx and resolution of
   neutropenia
   Pneumocystis
   - on steroids, tapering
   - on pentamidine and casofungin per ID
   Thrombocytopenia
   - likely multifactorial; ID is concerned that pentamidine may play a
   role
   - check DIC labs and smear.  If no
   - follow for now
   Oliguric acute renal failure
   -          likely related to hemodynamics
   -          volume challenge with isotonic bicarb
   -          check urine lytes and sediment
   -          Renal ultrasound
   Non-gap metabolic acidosis
   -          Likely secondary to diarrhea and pentamidine
   Ovarian malignancy
   - No acute rx. Mgmt per onc
   Neutropenia
   - neutropenic precautions
   - antibiotics while febrile
   Altered mental status
   -          Quite unresponsive in spite of relatively minimal sedation
   -          Hold sedation

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of metastatic ovarian malignancy who is currently in respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia and hypotension of unclear etiology. She is unresponsive and on multiple medications including broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antiparasitic agents. She has thrombocytopenia, oliguric acute renal failure, non-gap metabolic acidosis, and altered mental status. She is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for changes in sputum color, increased fever, and worsening oxygenation parameters would be important.
2. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, especially blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output, would be crucial. Hemodynamic support with fluids and vasopressors might be necessary.
3. Renal failure: The patient's oliguric acute renal failure requires close monitoring of kidney function and fluid balance. Adjusting diuretic therapy and managing fluid administration carefully would be important.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and considering platelet transfusion if necessary would be important.

   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma with
   brain and cervical spine metastases presented after fall at home
   transferred to ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia.
    # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to PCP pneumonia which appears worse by
   CXR. Also with 2+ GPC on gram stain sputum culture. Sats dropping
   overnight so increased PEEP and FIO2 to 12 and 80 respectively.
   -          F/U Sputum culture
   -          Monitor ABG
   -          Continue PCP therapy
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]          Continue empiric antibiotic with broad spectrum antibiotics
   -           Daily CXR
   #  PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]: Added caspofungin to regimen
   - continue Pentamidine, monitor LFTs
   - Ck daily CXR to rule out PTX
   - F/U ID recs
   - added caspofungin
   # COMA: Not responsive to pain. Concern for either intracranial bleed
   given thrombocytopenia. Also with known brain mets.
   - hold sedation
   - Stat Head CT
   #Hypotension/ Shock: Septic vs hypovolemic. Requiring pressors. Vitileo
   demonstrates elevated stroke volume variation despite numerous fluid
   boluses.
   -          IVF boluses for hypotension
   -          Continue empiric antibiotics
   #  Fevers: WBC 2.6 on GCSF. Profuse diarrhea concerning for c. diff vs
   antibiotic associated diarrhea. Also with 2+ GPCs in sputum. C diff
   toxin negative  x 2. Therefore likelihood of C diff infection is low.
   Also with other pulmonary source for fevers.
   -          cover with vanco and cefepime given lines
   -          continue abx for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]          If cultures negative, can begin to peel off abx.
   -          D/C flagyl for C. diff
   # Oliguric renal failure: minimal urine output with bump in creatinine
   from 0.6 to 1.  Could be prerenal vs ischemic ATN given hypotension.
   Also may be post renal failure [**12-22**] obstruction from knon ovarian CA.
   - send urine lytes
   - ck renal ultrasound
   - keep MAP greater than 60
   # Hyponatremia: Sodium currently normal.
   -        monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Weakness: with proximal muscle weakness, likely steroid-induced
   myopathy. ?worsening CNS involvement. Also in the setting of possible
   pneumonia. Telemetry unremarkable. Brain and C-spine MRI showed stable
   mets. Cannot wean off steroids yet due to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
    - symptomatic treatment, PT as tolerated once out of ICU
   - Nutritional status is poor given poor appetite, boost/supplements
   # Ovarian cancer with CNS mets: stable mets on MRI. On
   irinotecan/bevacizumab- last dose 10 days ago.
   - continue steroids
   - chemo on hold in setting of acute illness
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, hep SC, bowel regimen
   # FEN:  Tube feeds, [**Hospital1 **] finger sticks while on steroids.
   # Dispo: ICU level of care for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, brain and cervical spine metastases.
- She was transferred to the ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia, now with altered mental status, CMV viremia, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient has profuse watery bowel movements, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin was negative twice, making the likelihood of C. diff infection low.
- She has a positive CMV viral load and is being treated with ganciclovir.
- The patient requires pressor support with Neo and has hypotension requiring IVF boluses.
- She is experiencing non-gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to diarrhea.
- The patient has oliguric renal failure with minimal urine output and a bump in creatinine from 0.6 to 1.7.
- Her thrombocytopenia may be secondary to pentamidine, recent chemotherapy, or possibly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
- The patient has proximal muscle weakness likely due to steroid-induced myopathy.
- Her ovarian cancer with CNS metastases is stable on MRI.
- She is on irinotecan and bevacizumab chemotherapy, which is on hold in the setting of acute illness.
- The patient has hypothyroidism and is being treated with levothyroxine.

   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma with
   brain and cervical spine metastases presented after fall at home
   transferred to ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia now with altered
   mental status, CMV Viremia, renal failure and thrombocytopenia.
   .
    # PCP pneumonia
 Oxygenation stable but increasing ventilation
   requirements.
   -  Continue PCP therapy
 pentamidine/caspofungin and dexamethasone,
   appreciate ID recs
 dose for GFR 0 given rapid rise of Cr
   -  Continue empiric antibiotic with broad spectrum antibiotics
   -  Daily CXR
   .
   # CMV Viremia
 VL elevated at 32K. Started on ganciclovir. Possible
   cause of diarrhea
   - continue ganciclovir
 renal dosing
   - monitor VL
   - monitor counts/renal function w/ addition of ganciclovir
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Profuse Diarrhea
 pt with ~ 2L stool output [**4-23**]. C. diff negative to
   date. Toxin B sent. CMV VL positive at 32,000.
   - continue ganciclovir for CMV
 monitor VL
   - continue po vanco for empiric treatment of C. diff
 await toxin B
   - Continue IVF support as needed
   .
   # Altered MS
 Pt with minimal responsiveness to pain. Increasing
   spontaneous movement this pm. Likely toxic/metabolic component. CT Head
   negative for evidence of bleed. Pt with known brain mets.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - monitor neuro exam
 minimally responsive off sedation
   - consider MRI if fails to improve with holding sedation
    .
   #Hypotension/ Shock: Septic vs hypovolemic. Off pressors.
   -   IVF boluses for hypotension
   -   Continue empiric antibiotics
   -          Continue pressor support with neo as needed
   .
   # Oliguric renal failure: minimal urine output with continued rise in
   creatinine to 2.0.  Likely ATN given nephrotoxins and hypotension. Pt
   also with evidence of RTA based on urine lytes/gap. Acidosis corrected
   with Cl repletion.
   - renal ultrasound negative
   - keep MAP greater than 60
   - pt with poor urine output despite adequate BP
   - poor response to fluid bolus
   - renally dose medications
   - continue supportive care
   .
   #. Non gap metabolic acidosis: Likely secondary to diarrhea. [**Month (only) 60**] be RTA
   type 4 [**12-22**] pentamidine.
   - Elevated urine gap c/w RTA
   - IVF boluses with isotonic bicarb to correct acidosis
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pentamidine, nadir from recent
   chemo or possibly DIC or HIT. Given other likely causes for
   thrombocytopenia, will not investigate HIT as possible source at this
   time.
   - ck DIC labs
   -  monitor platelet count
   - Transfuse for less than 30
   .
   # Weakness: with proximal muscle weakness, likely steroid-induced
   myopathy. ?worsening CNS involvement. Also in the setting of possible
   pneumonia. Telemetry unremarkable. Brain and C-spine MRI showed stable
   mets. Cannot wean off steroids yet due to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **].
    - symptomatic treatment, PT as tolerated once out of ICU
   - Nutritional status is poor given poor appetite, boost/supplements
   .
   # Ovarian cancer with CNS mets: stable mets on MRI. On
   irinotecan/bevacizumab- last dose 10 days ago.
   - continue steroids
   - chemo on hold in setting of acute illness
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, hep SC, bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN:  Tube feeds, [**Hospital1 **] finger sticks while on steroids.
   .
   # Dispo: ICU level of care for now.
 Family meeting planned for Wed.
   Pt continues to decompensate with worsening renal failure and poor
   mental status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma and brain and cervical spine metastases.
- She presented to the ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia, now with altered mental status, CMV viremia, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient's condition has worsened, with profuse diarrhea, worsening renal function, and acidosis.
- She is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care.
- The patient has a history of ovarian cancer with CNS metastases, for which she is receiving chemotherapy.
- She also has other medical conditions such as hypothyroidism, and prophylactic measures are in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PCP pneumonia: The patient's PCP pneumonia appears worse on the CXR, indicating a potential worsening of respiratory status.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is minimally responsive to pain, with increasing spontaneous movement. This could indicate a decline in her neurological status.
3. CMV viremia: The patient has positive CMV viral load, which requires treatment with ganciclovir. CMV infection can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, and may contribute to her overall weakness and poor appetite.
4. Renal failure: The patient has minimal urine output and an elevated creatinine level. This suggests possible prerenal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma, brain, and cervical spine metastases. She presented to the ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia, altered mental status, CMV viremia, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. PCP Pneumonia: The patient's oxygenation is stable but shows no evidence of improvement. She is being treated with pentamidine/caspofungin and dexamethasone. Continuous monitoring and daily chest X-ray are recommended to assess the progression of the pneumonia.

2. CMV Viremia: The patient has an elevated viral load of 32,000 and is being treated with ganciclovir. The cause of her diarrhea may be CMV-related. Monitoring of viral load, blood counts, and renal function with the addition of ganciclovir is advised. Toxin B for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) negative so far.

3. Profuse Diarrhea: The patient has experienced bloody diarrhea, but C. diff has been ruled out. CMV viral load is positive at 32,000. Treatment with ganciclovir should continue, along with monitoring of viral load. Vancomycin is being administered for empiric treatment of C. diff, and the results of the toxin"

   Assessment and Plan
   77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma with
   brain and cervical spine metastases presented after fall at home
   transferred to ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia now with altered
   mental status, CMV Viremia, renal failure and thrombocytopenia.
   .
    # PCP pneumonia
 Oxygenation stable but no evidence of improvement.
   -  Continue PCP therapy
 pentamidine/caspofungin and dexamethasone,
   appreciate ID recs
 dose for GFR 0 given rapid rise of Cr
   -  Continue empiric antibiotic with broad spectrum antibiotics
   -  Daily CXR
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care as concern that patient may
   not respond to therapy
   .
   # CMV Viremia
 VL elevated at 32K. Started on ganciclovir. Possible
   cause of bloody diarrhea. Improvement since starting ganciclovir.
   - continue ganciclovir
 renal dosing
   - monitor VL
   - monitor counts/renal function w/ addition of ganciclovir
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Profuse Diarrhea
 Bloody diarrhea. Decreased output overnight. C.
   diff negative to date. Toxin B sent. CMV VL positive at 32,000.
   - continue ganciclovir for CMV
 monitor VL
 await toxin B; still pending
   - continue IV flagyl.
   # Altered MS
 Pt with minimal responsiveness to pain. Likely
   toxic/metabolic component. CT Head negative for evidence of bleed.
   Worsening neuro exam with upgoing toes bilaterally. No evidence of
   posturing. Pt with known brain mets.
   - Continue to hold sedation
   - monitor neuro exam
 minimally responsive off sedation
   - consider MRI if fails to improve with holding sedation
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
    .
   #Hypotension/ Shock: Septic vs hypovolemic. Off pressors.  BP now
   within normal for several days.
   -   IVF boluses for hypotension
   -   Continue empiric antibiotics
   .
   # Oliguric renal failure: minimal urine output with continued rise in
   creatinine to 2.3.  Likely ATN given nephrotoxins and hypotension. Pt
   also with evidence of RTA based on urine lytes/gap. Acidosis corrected
   with Cl repletion.
   - renal ultrasound negative
   - keep MAP greater than 60
   - pt with poor urine output despite adequate BP
   - poor response to fluid bolus
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #. Non gap metabolic acidosis: Evidence of RTA. Also with profuse
   diarrhea which can. [**Month (only) 60**] be RTA type 4 [**12-22**] pentamidine.
   - Elevated urine gap c/w RTA
   - IVF boluses with isotonic bicarb to correct acidosis
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to pentamidine, DIC or HIT. Given
   other likely causes for thrombocytopenia, will not investigate HIT as
   possible source at this time.  Fibrinogen level 886. INR 1.7.
   -  monitor platelet count
   - Transfuse for less than 30
   - hold HSC
   .
   # Weakness: Unable to assess as n9ow minimally responsive
    - symptomatic treatment, PT as tolerated once out of ICU
   - Nutritional status is poor given poor appetite, boost/supplements
   .
   # Ovarian cancer with CNS mets: stable mets on MRI. On
   irinotecan/bevacizumab- last dose 12days ago.
   - continue steroids
   - chemo on hold in setting of acute illness
   - f/u onc and neuro onc recs
   - family meeting for goals of care
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI, hep SC, bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN:  Tube feeds, [**Hospital1 **] finger sticks while on steroids.
   .
   # Dispo: ICU level of care for now.
 Family meeting planned for
   today. Pt continues to decompensate with worsening renal failure and
   poor mental status.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with primary papillary serous ovarian carcinoma and brain and cervical spine metastases. She presented to the ICU with PCP pneumonia and hypoxia, now with altered mental status, CMV viremia, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient has several medical complications that need attention:

1. PCP pneumonia: The patient is being treated with pentamidine/caspofungin and dexamethasone. Oxygenation is stable, but there is no evidence of improvement. Daily chest X-rays are being done.

2. CMV viremia: The patient has a positive VL at 32K and is on ganciclovir. The bloody diarrhea has improved since starting ganciclovir. Monitoring of VL, counts, and renal function is necessary.

3. Profuse diarrhea: The patient had bloody diarrhea, but the output has decreased overnight. C. difficile negative to date. Toxin B sent. CMV VL positive at 32,000. Continue ganciclovir for CMV and monitor VL. Await toxin B results and continue IV flagyl.

   Assessment and Plan
   Given her unresolving pneumonia, continuous vent requirement, CMV
   viremia, renal failure, and deterioration in neurological status, team
   felt it was unlikely for patient to recover. Family meeting was held
   and sons agreed to withdraw all care, except for the ventilator, as per
   the [**Hospital1 **] tradition. Patient was started on a morphine gtt for
   comfort. Continues on ventilator with high peep requirements. All other
   interventions were discontinued.

The patient is a 61-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with unresolving pneumonia, continuous ventilator requirement, CMV viremia, renal failure, and deterioration in neurological status. The family has agreed to withdraw all aggressive treatment, except for the ventilator, as per hospital tradition. The patient is currently on comfort measures only and is receiving morphine for pain relief. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilator use increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness can lead to blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum due to increased acid production.
4. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): Indwelling lines such as the PICC line or PortaCath can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream, leading to infection.
5. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring various nosocomial infections, including urinary tract infections and central line-associated meningitis.
6. Barotrauma: High levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can cause barotrauma, which is lung injury"

   Assessment and Plan
   Given her unresolving pneumonia, continuous vent requirement, CMV
   viremia, renal failure, and deterioration in neurological status, team
   felt it was unlikely for patient to recover. Family meeting was held
   and sons agreed to withdraw all care, except for the ventilator and
   tube feeds, as per the [**Hospital1 **] tradition. Patient was started on a
   morphine gtt for comfort. Continues on ventilator with high peep
   requirements and tube feeds with minimal residuals. All other
   interventions were discontinued. Will continue to communicate with
   family to answer questions as needed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female admitted to the ICU with unresolving pneumonia, CMV viremia, renal failure, and deteriorating neurological status. The patient's family agreed to withdraw all aggressive treatment, except for mechanical ventilation and tube feeds. The patient is currently on comfort measures only and is receiving morphine for pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and daily chest x-rays will be necessary to detect any signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and early ambulation should be implemented to reduce the risk.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at higher risk of developing stress ulcers due to the physiological stress. Proton pump inhibitors like pantoprazole should be continued to prevent these ulcers.
4. Autonomic dysreflexia: In patients with spinal cord injuries or neurological impairment, autonomic dysreflexia can occur, causing severe hypertension and potentially leading to stroke or other complications. Regular blood pressure monitoring is essential to detect any abnormal increases.
5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can result in pressure ulcers."

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male admitted to the ICU with unresolving pneumonia, continuous ventilator requirement, CMV viremia, renal failure, and deterioration in neurological status. The medical team felt it unlikely for the patient to recover and held a family meeting where the sons agreed to withdraw all care except for the ventilator and tube feeds, as per hospital tradition. The patient has been started on morphine for comfort and continues on the ventilator with high PEEP requirements and tube feeds with minimal residuals. All other interventions have been discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on a ventilator with high PEEP requirements, which can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. This increases the risk of fluid overload and further deterioration of renal function.
3. Neurological Deterioration: The patient's neurological status is deteriorating, which could be due to hypoxic damage or infection. This increases the risk of additional neurological complications such as seizures or brain hemorrhage.
4. CMV Viremia: The patient has CMV viremia, which is a viral infection that can be severe in immunocompromised individuals. It can lead to complications such as gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatitis, or bone marrow suppression.
5. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Given her unresolving pneumonia, continuous vent requirement, CMV
   viremia, renal failure, and deterioration in neurological status, it is
   unlikely for patient to recover.
   - Continue comfort measures only
   - Confirm with son wishes to d/c ventilator; otherwise continue
   ventilation and tube feeds

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of continuous ventilator requirement, unresolving pneumonia, CMV viremia, renal failure, and deterioration in neurological status. The patient's son wishes to discontinue ventilator support. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 73/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and antiviral medications. The laboratory results indicate renal failure and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet count are within normal range. The patient's neurological status is deteriorating.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on continuous ventilator support for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Prolonged mechanical ventilation can cause lung damage, especially with high tidal volumes or inappropriate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings.
3. Barotrauma: High airway pressures during mechanical ventilation may lead to barotrauma, causing lung or pleural injury.
4. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of CMV viremia increase the risk of developing sepsis.
