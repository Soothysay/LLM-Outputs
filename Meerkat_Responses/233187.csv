   #) Hypoxia
 CXR demonstrates worsening of opacities. Positive for
   paraflu, however at high risk of infection due to immunosuppression. He
   has been on broad spectrum coverage for possible bacterial and fungal
   etiologies for the past few days and is worsening. Possible infectious
   etiologies include viral causes including CMV (but recently has had
   negative CMV VLs), adenovirus, TB, PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] for influenza. Other
   possibilities include GVHD, BOOP, COP, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, or
   component of volume overload/pulm edema.
   - Continue current regimen: vancomycin, cefepime, acyclovir,
   micafungin, atovaquone.
   - Patient will need to be intubated if want bronchoscopy
   - TB precautions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was initially admitted for fever, fatigue, and diarrhea, and then transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has multiple medical conditions including MDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic low back pain, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral therapy, antifungal therapy, and immunosuppressive medications. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 132/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on non-rebreather mask. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal renal function tests. The patient's diagnosis includes hypoxemia, diarrhea, liver function abnormalities, and possible infections such as viral, bacterial, and fungal etiologies. The patient's plan includes continuing current medical therapy, monitoring urine output, performing diagnostic tests including bronchoscopy, and initiating tuberculosis precautions. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic low back pain. He was initially admitted for failure to thrive (FTT), diarrhea, and respiratory distress, and later transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia, bilateral ground-glass opacities on imaging, bandemia, and worsening despite broad-spectrum antibiotic and antifungal coverage. Other possible infectious etiologies include viral causes such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, parainfluenza, or influenza, as well as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Pulmonary consultation recommended a bronchoscopy, but it is being held off due to the patient's hypoxia.

The patient also has bloody diarrhea, previously diagnosed as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the colon. He has been treated with infliximab and continues on immunosuppressive therapy.

Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are present, with a differential diagnosis including GVHD of the liver, drug effect, or cholestasis. MRCP showed dilation of extrahepatic ducts without stones.

The patient has a history ofGV"

 Stable. Differential diagnosis includes GVHD of
   liver vs. drug effect, cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement. MRCP
   limited by pt movement but did demonstrate dilation of extrahepatic
   duct without any stones.
   - Appreciate hepatology consult.
   - Hold on possibility of ERCP for now until better respiratory status
   - Continue to monitor daily.

   I have seen and examined the patient with the resident
s and agree with
   the assessment and plan with the following emphasis/changes:
   This is a 65 yo M with h/o MDS who is day +68 s/p nonablative matched
   unrelated donor stem cell transplant complicated by acute GVHD of the
   skin and gut who initially presented with FTT and now is transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] in setting of worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. He
   was ultimately found to have parainfluenza and radiographs reveal
   bilateral infiltrates.  He progressed over 36-48 hours to increasingly
   more dyspneic and this morning respiratory rate is now increasing and
   hypoxia worsening despite high flow oxygen.
   On exam, patient is in mild-mod respiratory distress and hypoxic
   despite high flow O2
   CXR: coarse BS bilaterally
   S1 S2 reg
   Abd: soft NT ND
   Ext: no edema
   CXR: bilateral infiltrates
   Cultures: Still no growth
   Assessment/Plan:
   1)       Respiratory Failure secondary to pneumonia
   -          Has confirmed parainfluenza and may have superimposed
   bacterial infection
   -          Continue Tamiflu and continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   -          Because now in significant respiratory distress and
   desaturating, we will perfom endotracheal intubation
   -          After intubation, will do bronch or mini-BAL for good sample
   2)       MDS S/P unrelated donor stem cell transplant
   3)       GVHD

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin and gut, which is a common complication following stem cell transplantation. He also presented with bloody diarrhea, which has been extensively evaluated, including sigmoidoscopy, and the path was consistent with GVHD. The patient has received infliximab and is being monitored for further progression.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and the differential diagnosis includes GVHD of the liver versus drug effect, as well as cholestasis. An MRCP demonstrated dilation of extrahepatic ducts without any stones, and hepatology consult has been appreciated.

The patient is also experiencing a rash, which is suspected to be secondary to GVHD. He has been started on high-dose steroids and is being monitored closely.

The patient's medical history also includes hypertension (HTN), chronic low back pain, coronary artery disease (CAD), and MDS. His current medications include cyclosporine, ursodiol, acyclovir, micafungin, cellcept, methylprednisolone, and budesonide.

He was initially admitted for failure to thrive, diarrhea, and transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia.

The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including MDS, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic low back pain, and chronic atrial fibrillation. He is currently on several medications, including cyclosporine, ursodiol, acyclovir, micafungin, cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide, metoprolol, nifedipine, and opioids for pain management.

His vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 103 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 130/53 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95% on high-flow nasal cannula.

   65 yo M day +68 s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor stem cell
   transplant for MDS, CAD, chronic low back pain initially admitted for
   FTT, diarrhea and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for worsening respiratory
   distress and hypoxia.
   .
   #) Hypoxia
 CXR demonstrates worsening of opacities. Positive for
   parainfluenza, however at high risk of infection due to
   immunosuppression for secondary infection also. He has been on broad
   spectrum coverage for possible bacterial and fungal etiologies for the
   past few days and is worsening. Possible infectious etiologies include
   viral causes including CMV (but recently has had negative CMV VLs),
   adenovirus, TB, PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] for influenza. Other possibilities
   include GVHD, BOOP, COP, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, or component of
   volume overload/pulm edema. [**6-18**] stopped atovaquone and changed to
   clindamycin, and changed micafungin to voriconazole.
   - Continue current regimen: vancomycin, cefepime, acyclovir,
   voriconazole ([**6-18**]- ), cliindamycin ([**6-18**]- ), and cipro ([**6-18**]- )
   - Patient will need to be intubated if want bronchoscopy, but will
   monitor respiratory status if needed
   - TB precautions while awaiting AFB
   - Repeat ABG.
   - Continue to monitor urine output. Goal I/O negative 500 liters
   - f/u urinary legionella, urine histo Ag, serum crypto Ag, adenovirus
   PCR, mycoplasma IgM/IgG, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] stool viral PCR.
   - f/u serum IgG.
   - Nebs prn.
   - Appreciate ID following, will f/u recs.
   .
   #) Bloody diarrhea - Has had extensive prior work-up including
   sigmoidoscopy [**5-11**] with path being c/w GVHD. Stool volumes have varied
   with how much steroids and other immunosuppresion pt has received. s/p
   inflixumab on [**6-13**].
   - f/u GI recs.
   - Will hold on repeat sigmoidoscopy for now given respiratory status.
   - Continue current immunosuppresion with methylprednisolone,
   budesonide, cyclosporine, and cellcept
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs
 Stable. Differential diagnosis includes GVHD of
   liver vs. drug effect, cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement. MRCP
   limited by pt movement but did demonstrate dilation of extrahepatic
   duct without any stones.
   - Appreciate hepatology consult.
   - Hold on possibility of ERCP for now until better respiratory status
   - Continue to monitor daily.
   .
   #) Rash - [**2-4**] GVHD. Plan as above. Monitor FS with HISS while on high
   dose steroids.
   .
   #) MDS s/p BMT: Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide. Will follow-up primary BMT
   team recommendations.
   .
   #) HTN
 thought to be elevated from cyclosporine. However now starting
   diuresis
   - decrease metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 25 TID while being diuresed
   - continue nifedipine 20 mg q8h, but will adjust as  needed
   .
   #) Pain
    - Continue oxycontin and oxycodone (percocet in house)
   .
   #) CAD
    - Continue beta-blocker. Not on ASA in peri transplant setting.
   .
   #) Access - Tunneled triple lumen [**Last Name (LF) 7108**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   #) FEN/Lytes - TPN, replete lytes [**Hospital1 **]

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male who underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and has a history of chronic low back pain and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was initially admitted for failure to thrive (FTT) and diarrhea, and then transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 130/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode. His physical examination shows mild use of accessory muscles, bronchial breath sounds at the left base, occasional wheezes bilaterally, and cool skin.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. His blood cultures have shown positive results for parainfluenza virus, and he has negative cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral load.

The patient's current medical issues include hypoxemia, diarrhea, liver function abnormalities, and possible infections such as viral causes (including CMV, adenovirus, TB, PCP), secondary infections, GVHD, BOOP, COPD,"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, CAD, chronic
   LBP, initially admitted for diarrhea, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxia: Likely [**2-4**] infection. Has parainfluenza, and now also high
   level viremia of adenovirus. Also at high risk for other infection. [**Month (only) 8**]
   also have worsened hypoxia from pulm edema vs GVHDz in the lung. [**6-18**]
   stopped atovaquone and changed to clindamycin, and changed micafungin
   to voriconazole. S/p intubation [**6-20**]. Mini-BAL on [**6-20**] with GNRs.
   - vancomycin, cefepime, acyclovir, voriconazole ([**6-18**]- ), clindamycin
   ([**6-18**]- ), and cipro ([**6-18**]- ). On vent now with higher FIO2, concern for
   ARDs.

   - bronch today to look for DAH
   - increase PEEP
   # Bloody diarrhea: Has had extensive prior work-up including
   sigmoidoscopy [**5-11**] with path being c/w GVHD. Stool volumes have varied
   with how much steroids and other immunosuppresion pt has received. s/p
   inflixumab on [**6-13**].
   - f/u GI recs.
   - flexible sigmoidoscopy, will hold off
   - Continue current immunosuppresion with methylprednisolone,
   budesonide, cyclosporine, and cellcept
   - monitor lytes
   # Hypernatremia: likely from NS resuscitation. Given D5W on [**6-20**] for Na
   of 151.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant. He presented with fever, tiredness, and diarrhea and was initially admitted for diarrhea but later transferred to the ICU due to worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure secondary to pneumonia: The patient has confirmed parainfluenza infection and may have a superimposed bacterial infection. He also has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.
2. Adenovirus/Parainfluenza virus infection: The patient is growing adenovirus from blood PCR and has confirmed parainfluenza infection. He is currently being treated with antiviral medication.
3. MDS post unrelated donor stem cell transplant: The patient's underlying condition of MDS may predispose him to infections and other complications.
4. GVHD (Graft versus Host Disease): The patient has acute GVHD of the skin and gut, which can lead to various complications such as infection, organ dysfunction, and poor wound healing.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic lung disease (LBP), and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient was initially admitted for diarrhea but was transferred to the ICU due to worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, bloody diarrhea, hypernatremia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), rash, and hypertension. The possible causes of these conditions are infection, pulmonary edema, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the lung, or other underlying factors.

The patient has been treated with various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals. The patient's immunosuppression regimen includes methylprednisolone, budesonide, cyclosporine, and cellcept. The patient also has ongoing nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include worsening respiratory distress, sepsis, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and appropriate management of these conditions are essential for the patient's well-being."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) post stem cell transplantation (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), and currently admitted for respiratory failure. The patient was initially admitted for diarrhea and then transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. The patient's condition has worsened, and he required intubation.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient likely has a viral infection with a gram-negative bacterial superinfection, as well as adenovirusemia. The patient also has pulmonary edema versus graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the lung. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.

Other medical complications mentioned in the progress note include bloody diarrhea, hypernatremia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and rash. The bloody diarrhea is suspected to be caused by GVHD, and the patient has received infliximab. The hypernatremia is likely due to normal saline resuscitation, and the patient is being given D5W to correct the sodium levels. The elevated LFTs are attributed to GVHD or drug effects, and the patient requires a hepatology consult. The rash is also suspected to be GVHD-related.

The patient's medications include cyclosporine, ursodiol, acyclovir, micafungin, cellcept,"

1. Hypoxia: The patient has a high level of viremia of adenovirus and is also at risk for other infections. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with increased FiO2. The hypoxia may be due to pulmonary edema or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the lung.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level likely from normal saline (NS) resuscitation. D5W has been given to lower the sodium level.

3. Diarrhea: The patient has bloody diarrhea with prior work-up including sigmoidoscopy showing GVHD. Stool volumes have varied with changes in immunosuppression.

4. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with a differential diagnosis including GVHD of the liver versus drug effect or cholestasis. MRCP demonstrated dilation of extrahepatic duct without any stones.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male who underwent allo-SCT 2 months ago and has been diagnosed with GVHD. He is currently admitted to the ICU for paraflu infection, positive adenovirus viral load in blood, and fever. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics, antivirals, and other medications. He is intubated and sedated, with active exhalation and crackles in the left lung base. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient has hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, and MDS post allo-SCT/GVHD. He is on TPN with lipids and receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's crackles in the left lung base and prolonged expiratory phase suggest a potential risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Infection: The patient's positive viral load and fever indicate an ongoing infection. It is crucial to continue the current antibiotic regimen and monitor for any signs of progression or new infections.
3. Hepatic Dysfunction: The liver function abnormalities may indicate hepatic dysfunction. Further evaluation and management should be done to prevent any complications related to liver failure.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be corrected carefully to avoid complications such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of allo-SCT 2 months ago, GVHD, paraflu from respiratory sample, and positive adenovirus viral load in blood. The patient has been experiencing fever and has been converted to PCV. He is currently on cidofovir and has received various antibiotics in the past 24 hours. The patient is intubated and sedated, with crackles in the left base of the lungs. Vital signs include a temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 128/62 to 141/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and kidney function. The patient also has liver function abnormalities, with elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a positive adenovirus viral load in blood, paraflu from respiratory sample, and is experiencing fever. These findings suggest a potential viral infection. The patient is also on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a concern for bacterial infection as well.

2. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hyponatremia, which is a low sodium level in the blood. This condition can cause symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and muscle weakness."

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) post stem cell transplantation (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), initially admitted for diarrhea, transferred to the ICU for hypoxia, and now intubated. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure likely caused by a viral infection with a Gram-negative bacterial (GNR) superinfection. Parainfluenza Type 3 was detected in a nasal swab, and adenoviremia was also identified. A mini-brain autopsy with GNRs was performed on the 20th.

The patient has several other medical issues, including bloody diarrhea with a previous work-up indicating GVHD, ongoing treatment with immunosuppressive medications, and an improvement in symptoms after receiving infliximab. Hypernatremia is present, likely due to NS resuscitation, and is being treated with D5W. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are stable and could be attributed to GVHD or drug effects. A hepatology consult is recommended. The patient also has a rash consistent with GVHD, which is being monitored. Other ongoing treatments include cyclosporine, ursodiol, acyclovir, micafungin, cellcept, and methylprednisolone.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) status post stem cell transplant (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), initially admitted for diarrhea and transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. He is currently intubated and sedated due to respiratory failure caused by a likely viral infection with bacterial superinfection. The patient also has worsening hypoxia from pulmonary edema versus graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the lung. He is on mechanical ventilation and various medications for infection coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory function is necessary.
2. Supra-infections: The patient is at high risk for other super-infections due to his immunocompromised state. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt identification of any new signs of infection are crucial.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and there is a risk of further hypotension. Decreasing levophed and starting phenylephrine may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Diuretic use: The patient requires careful monitoring and diuresis to manage fluid balance and prevent fluid overload.
5. Acute renal failure: Although the patient's urine output is currently adequate, close monitoring of renal function is necessary, especially considering the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of MDS and previous allo-SCT, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient is mechanically ventilated and receiving multiple antibiotics due to suspected viral PNA/viremia/resp failure. He has hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, and is receiving TPN with lipids. The patient has a tunneled (Hickman) line, arterial line, and peripheral IV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation while on mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient is already on multiple antibiotics due to suspected viral PNA/viremia/resp failure. There is a risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections or other hospital-acquired infections.
3. Liver toxicity: The patient's liver function abnormalities may progress, leading to further impairment of liver function. This could be exacerbated by the continued administration of antibiotics that are potentially hepatotoxic.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels need to be monitored closely to prevent complications such as neurological dysfunction or seizures.
5. Thrombotic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
6. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): As a previous allo-SCT recipient, the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an ICU admission with multiple medical complications. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and asynchronous ventilation. They have been receiving various antibiotics and sedation. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.9 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 105/57 to 148/72 mmHg, heart rate between 97 and 132 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and plateau pressure of 26 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate renal failure with an increase in creatinine from 0.3 to 1.3 over the past week, pancytopenia with decreased white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, hypernatremia with a sodium level of 156 mEq/L, liver function abnormalities including elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's chest X-ray shows slightly more prominent infiltrates.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing medical issues including renal failure, possibly due to medication toxicity, particularly cido"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint and HPI suggest ongoing issues with fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress. 

The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and antiviral medications, including clindamycin, voriconazole, acyclovir, vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and Tamiflu. They are also on multiple infusions of midazolam (versed), norepinephrine, fentanyl, and propofol.

The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature, tachycardia, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates significant fluid intake and output imbalances.

Laboratory results reveal renal failure with an increase in creatinine from 0.3 to 1.3 over the past week. This could be due to medication toxicity, with cidofovir being a likely culprit. The patient also has hypernatremia, pancytopenia, hypotension, viral pneumonia, liver function abnormalities, and a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with prior allogenic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and glycemic control. They have multiple lines"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), coronary artery disease (CAD), who was admitted for diarrhea and later transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxia. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors including shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, hypernatremia, diarrhea, liver function abnormalities, hypoxemia, and rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at high risk for sepsis due to the presence of fever, tachycardia, and worsening respiratory status. The recent switch in antibiotics suggests a possible bacterial infection.
2. ARDS: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which is characterized by severe lung inflammation and impaired gas exchange.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of renal parameters and urine output is essential.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. This can lead to neurological complications if not managed appropriately.
5. Diarrhea: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly bloody diarrhea, may indicate an ongoing infection or complications related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
6. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, suggesting"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M w MDS s/p SCT ([**4-/2126**]), CAD, initially admitted for diarrhea,
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for hypoxia, now s/p intubation.
   # Respiratory failure: Likely [**2-4**] viral infection w Sternotrophomonas
   xanthomonas [**6-20**]. Parainfluenza Type 3 in nasal swab ([**6-18**]).
   Adenoviremia. [**Month (only) 8**] also have worsened hypoxia from pulm edema vs GVHDz
   in the lung. [**6-18**] stopped atovaquone and changed to clindamycin, and
   changed voriconazole back to micafungin. S/p intubation [**6-20**].
   Clindamycin ([**Date range (1) 7235**])
   - vancomycin, cefepime, cipro ([**6-18**]- )
   - acyclovir
   - cidovir ([**6-21**] - ) for adenovirus
   - miconazole for fungal coverage
   - oseltamivir for parainfluenza
   - continue mechanical ventilation, attempt to decrease PEEP, will
   increase FIO2 if needed
   - monitor ABGs
   - hold diuresis due to caridac issues
   - f/u pending studies/cxs sensetivities
   - f/u ID recs
   - consider paralytics if needed once propofol is decreased
   # Caridac ischemia/Afib with RVR: AM of [**6-24**],  had afib with RVR, then
   developed ST elevations on EKG. Concerning for ischemia in RV. Concern
   for CAD vs vasospasm due to pressors. Is preload dependent. Been on
   lasix gtt since last night.
   - cardiology recs
   - given transfusion
   - trying to wean propofol, so neo can be weaned if possible
   - consider ASA, however, plts low
   - will hold off on cath due to inability to anticoagulate
   - discontinue lasix gtt
   - try to derease PEEP but up titrating the FIO2
   - consider beta blocker, low dose
   - use dopamine if need a pressor
   - start statin
   - if presistant hypotension may need aortic balloon pump
   # Hypotension: On neo gtt, levo was weaned off. Was on lasix gtt
   - see above for plan to decrease neo and try to increase preload
   - transfuse if needed
   # Bloody diarrhea: Has had extensive prior work-up including
   sigmoidoscopy [**5-11**] with path being c/w GVHD. Stool volumes have varied
   with how much steroids and other immunosuppresion pt has received. s/p
   inflixumab on [**6-13**]. Symptomatically better.
   - f/u GI recs. Patient currently not stable enough for sigmoidoscopy.
   - continue current immunosuppresion with methylprednisolone,
   budesonide, cyclosporine, and cellcept
   - monitor lytes
   - start bowel meds, since no BMs
   # Hypernatremia: likely from NS resuscitation and high Na in TPN. Now
   resolved
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Acute Renal Failure: Most likely secondary to cidovir dose. Urine
   output adequate.  Now dark red urine. Lytes were more consitent with
   prerenal, but likely also has instrinsic renal damage from medicaiton.
   - renal consult
   - resent urine
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
   - try to avoid further nephrotoxins
   # Acute Anemia: Close to prior baseline.
   - pm HCT
   # Elevated LFTs: Stable. Differential diagnosis includes GVHD of liver
   vs. drug effect, cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement. MRCP
   limited by pt movement but did demonstrate dilation of extrahepatic
   duct without any stones. LFTs downtrending.
   - Continue to monitor daily.
   .
   # Rash: [**2-4**] GVHD. Plan as above. Monitor FS with HISS while on high
   dose steroids.
   # MDS s/p BMT:
   - Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin, cellcept,
   methylprednisolone, budesonide, atovaquone
   - BMT team recommendations
   - monitor neutrophil count
   - monitor cyclosporine level

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) post stem cell transplant (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), initially admitted for diarrhea, transferred to the hospital for hypoxia, now intubated. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure due to a likely viral infection with Sternotrophomonas xanthomonas, pulmonary edema, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the lung. The patient also has cardiac ischemia/atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which developed into ST elevations on the EKG, indicating possible ischemia in the right ventricle. There is concern for coronary artery disease (CAD) versus vasospasm due to pressors. The patient is preload-dependent and has been on a lasix drip since last night.

The patient also has hypotension, bloody diarrhea attributed to GVHD, hypernatremia resolved, acute renal failure secondary to cidovir dose, acute anemia close to prior baseline, elevated liver function tests (LFTs) stable, and a rash consistent with GVHD. The patient's medications include clindamycin, vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, acyclovir, micafungin, oseltamivir, methylprednisolone, budesonide, cyclosporine, and cellcept.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure of 117/61 mmH"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of MDS, s/p SCT, CAD, initially admitted for diarrhea, transferred to the ICU for hypoxia, and now intubated. He has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure due to viral infection with Sternotrophomonas xanthomonas, cardiac ischemia/atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, bloody diarrhea likely secondary to GVHD, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, anemia, elevated liver function tests, rash, and MDS s/p BMT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to a viral infection with Sternotrophomonas xanthomonas. There is a potential complication of worsening hypoxia and further deterioration in respiratory status.

2. Cardiac ischemia/atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient has developed ST elevations on EKG, which is concerning for ischemia in the right ventricle. This can lead to further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be related to his cardiac issues or other factors. This can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.

4. Bloody diarrhea: The patient has bloody diarrhea likely secondary to GVHD. This can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential sepsis.

   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, CAD, chronic
   LBP, initially admitted for diarrhea, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   CAD -- evidence for acute MI this AM, RV distribution.  Known
   underlying CAD.  Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, ASA and
   possible cardiac cath --> however, not candidate for anticoabulation or
   ASA (high risk for bleed).  Not candidate for cardiac cath
   (infection).  Plan optimize hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).
   Initiate statin.  Attempt trial of b-blocker if tolerates
   hemodynamically.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirsu).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation,
   antimicrobials.  Monitor ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg.
   Desire to maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize
   sedation to minimize dysynchrony.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro.
   SEPSIS -- Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   RENAL FAILURE -- evolving oliguria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension).  Now off lasix infusion.  Renal US
   unrevealing for obstruction.  Renal consultation in progresss.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- resolved.  Monitor Na.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. He underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic liver disease, and chronic back pain. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated, sedated, and requires IV lasix to maintain urine output. 

New findings include the presence of atrial fibrillation on the monitor, with an EKG revealing new ST segment elevation in the inferior leads, suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). A cardiac echo showed hypokinetic right ventricle (RV), indicating reduced RV function. 

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including voriconazole, acyclovir, cefepime, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. He is also on midazolam, phenylephrine, fentanyl, and propofol infusions, as well as metoprolol and other medications.

Vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an increased respiratory rate. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on supplemental oxygen. Laboratory results indicate renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute MI with RV involvement - recommended anticoagulation, aspirin"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, CAD, chronic
   LBP, initially admitted for diarrhea, transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for
   worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia.
   CAD -- evidence for acute MI this AM, RV distribution.  Known
   underlying CAD.  Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, ASA and
   possible cardiac cath --> however, not candidate for anticoabulation or
   ASA (high risk for bleed).  Not candidate for cardiac cath
   (infection).  Plan optimize hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).
   Initiate statin.  Attempt trial of b-blocker if tolerates
   hemodynamically.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirsu).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation,
   antimicrobials.  Monitor ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg.
   Desire to maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize
   sedation to minimize dysynchrony.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro.
   SEPSIS -- Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   RENAL FAILURE -- evolving oliguria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension).  Now off lasix infusion.  Renal US
   unrevealing for obstruction.  Renal consultation in progresss.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- resolved.  Monitor Na.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic low back pain. He was admitted initially for diarrhea and transferred to the ICU due to worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia. The patient has a history of known underlying CAD and now presents with evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) in the right ventricular distribution. Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, aspirin, and possible cardiac catheterization; however, the patient is at high risk for bleeding and not a candidate for anticoagulation or cardiac catheterization. The plan is to optimize hemodynamics, initiate statin therapy, and attempt a trial of beta-blocker if tolerated hemodynamically.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure attributed to infection (parainfluenza and adenovirus) with a risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), positive fluid balance (possibly contributing to left heart failure), and unclear whether it is related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Mechanical ventilation will be continued, along with antimicrobials. ABG monitoring will be maintained to keep the pH between 7.35-7.40 and pO2 above 60 mmHg. A net negative fluid balance will be desired, and sedation will be optimized to minimize dysynchrony.

Additionally, the patient has pneumonia"

   # Respiratory failure: Likely [**2-4**] viral infection w Sternotrophomonas
   xanthomonas [**6-20**]. Parainfluenza Type 3 in nasal swab ([**6-18**]).
   Adenoviremia. [**Month (only) 8**] also have worsened hypoxia from pulm edema vs GVHDz
   in the lung. [**6-18**] stopped atovaquone and changed to clindamycin, and
   changed voriconazole back to micafungin. S/p intubation [**6-20**].
   Clindamycin ([**Date range (1) 7235**])
   - vancomycin, cefepime, cipro ([**6-18**]- )
   - acyclovir
   - cidovir ([**6-21**] - ) for adenovirus
   - miconazole for fungal coverage
   - oseltamivir for parainfluenza
   - continue mechanical ventilation, attempt to decrease PEEP, will
   increase FIO2 if needed
   - monitor ABGs
   - hold diuresis due to caridac issues
   - f/u pending studies/cxs sensetivities
   - f/u ID recs
   - consider paralytics if needed once propofol is decreased
   # Caridac ischemia/Afib with RVR: AM of [**6-24**],  had afib with RVR, then
   developed ST elevations on EKG. Concerning for ischemia in RV. Concern
   for CAD vs vasospasm due to pressors. Is preload dependent. Been on
   lasix gtt since last night.
   - cardiology recs
   - given transfusion
   - trying to wean propofol, so neo can be weaned if possible
   - consider ASA, however, plts low
   - will hold off on cath due to inability to anticoagulate
   - discontinue lasix gtt
   - try to derease PEEP but up titrating the FIO2
   - consider beta blocker, low dose
   - use dopamine if need a pressor
   - start statin
   - if presistant hypotension may need aortic balloon pump
   # Hypotension: On neo gtt, levo was weaned off. Was on lasix gtt
   - see above for plan to decrease neo and try to increase preload
   - transfuse if needed
   # Bloody diarrhea: Has had extensive prior work-up including
   sigmoidoscopy [**5-11**] with path being c/w GVHD. Stool volumes have varied
   with how much steroids and other immunosuppresion pt has received. s/p
   inflixumab on [**6-13**]. Symptomatically better.
   - f/u GI recs. Patient currently not stable enough for sigmoidoscopy.
   - continue current immunosuppresion with methylprednisolone,
   budesonide, cyclosporine, and cellcept
   - monitor lytes
   - start bowel meds, since no BMs
   # Hypernatremia: likely from NS resuscitation and high Na in TPN. Now
   resolved
   - monitor [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Acute Renal Failure: Most likely secondary to cidovir dose. Urine
   output adequate.  Now dark red urine. Lytes were more consitent with
   prerenal, but likely also has instrinsic renal damage from medicaiton.
   - renal consult
   - resent urine
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - renally dose meds
   - try to avoid further nephrotoxins
   # Acute Anemia: Close to prior baseline.
   - pm HCT
   # Elevated LFTs: Stable. Differential diagnosis includes GVHD of liver
   vs. drug effect, cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement. MRCP
   limited by pt movement but did demonstrate dilation of extrahepatic
   duct without any stones. LFTs downtrending.
   - Continue to monitor daily.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) post stem cell transplant (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), initially admitted for diarrhea, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypoxia, now intubated. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to a likely viral infection with Stentrophomonas xanthomonas and parainfluenza Type 3 in the nasal swab. There is also worsening hypoxia from pulmonary edema versus graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the lung. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and the plan is to decrease PEEP and increase FiO2 as needed. 

The patient is also experiencing cardiac ischemia/atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), myocardial infarction (STEMI/NSTEMI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hypernatremia (high sodium), diarrhea, liver function abnormalities, hypoxemia, and anemia.

The patient's current medications include clindamycin, vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, micafungin, acyclovir, statin, beta-blocker, and other immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine, cellcept, and methylprednisolone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MDS) status post stem cell transplantation (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), initially admitted for diarrhea, and transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. The patient is now on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has several medical complications including myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, hypoxemia, anemia, and rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Ischemia/Afib with RVR: The patient experienced elevations in cardiac enzymes and troponins, indicating possible cardiac ischemia or a heart attack. There is also evidence of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which can lead to poor cardiac output and further complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which can result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Diarrhea: The patient initially presented with diarrhea, which has been attributed to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This can cause fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure has progressed to ARDS, characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, likely secondary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MDS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and post-stem cell transplantation (SCT). He was initially admitted for diarrhea and later transferred to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of viral infection with Sternotrophomonas xanthomonas, parainfluenza Type 3, and adenoviremia. The patient's condition has worsened with pulmonary edema and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the lung. He has also experienced cardiac ischemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), ST elevations on EKG, and troponin peak. There is a concern for vasospasm or CAD. The patient has hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hypernatremia, bloody diarrhea likely due to GVHD, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and anemia. The patient's current medications include clindamycin, micafungin, ciprofloxacin, amiodarone, midazolam, fentanyl, and various other immunosuppressive agents. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has shown signs of cardiac ischemia, atrial fibrillation with RVR, ST elevations on EKG, and elevated troponin levels, which are indicative of a myocardial infarction.
2. Shock: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension and requires vasopressors for blood pressure support, suggesting possible shock.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and worsening hypoxia, along with the presence of diffuse rhonchi on pulmonary examination, indicate ARDS.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with muddy brown casts and elevated creatinine levels, indicating intrinsic renal damage.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels are likely due to NS resuscitation and high sodium content in TPN. Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary.
6. Diarrhea: The patient has bloody diarrhea, which is likely secondary to GVHD. Monitoring of stool output and ongoing immunosuppression is required.
7. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has stable LFTs, but further investigation is needed to determine the cause, which could be GVHD or drug-induced liver injury.
8. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia, likely secondary to chronic blood loss and ongoing immunosuppression.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and additional details may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multiple sclerosis (MDS) post stem cell transplant (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), initially admitted for diarrhea, and transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. He is now intubated.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, hypoxemia, diarrhea, and myocardial infarction.
- The patient's cardiac condition includes cardiac ischemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB with RVR), and ST-elevation on EKG. Troponins are peaking, and right ventricular (RV) hypokinesis is observed. There is concern for coronary artery disease (CAD) or vasospasm due to pressors.
- The patient's respiratory failure has improved with pressure control settings. He tolerates oxygen in the 60s and likely has a viral infection with Sternotrophomonas xanthomonas. Parainfluenza Type 3 was detected in the nasal swab, and adenovirus is present.
- The patient's renal function is compromised, with muddy brown casts indicating intrinsic renal damage. Urine output is adequate, but the patient has bright red urine Foley output.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with a differential diagnosis including graft-versus"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of MDS s/p SCT (stem cell transplantation), CAD (coronary artery disease), and other conditions. The patient was initially admitted for diarrhea and then transferred to the ICU for hypoxia, resulting in endotracheal intubation.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient experienced an acute MI, likely secondary to coronary artery disease. Treatment includes antiarrhythmic medications, cardiac enzymes monitoring, and consideration for cardiac catheterization.

2. Shock: The patient had episodes of hypotension requiring pressor support, indicating possible cardiogenic shock or septic shock due to an underlying infection.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure has been managed with mechanical ventilation, pressure control settings, and ABGs stabilization. Increased congestion on chest X-ray suggests fluid overload, which needs to be addressed.

4. Renal Failure: The patient developed acute renal failure, likely secondary to medication toxicity (specifically, cidovir dose). Intrinsic renal damage may also be present. Renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be adjusted accordingly.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient had hypernatremia likely due to NS resuscitation and high sodium content in TPN. This condition has resolved.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MDS) post stem cell transplantation (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), and initial admission for diarrhea. He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and is now intubated.

Summary:
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, hypoxemia, and diarrhea.
- He is currently experiencing cardiac ischemia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), as well as hypotension.
- The patient's respiratory failure has improved with pressure control settings and ABGs stable, but he still has worsened hypoxia from pulmonary edema versus graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the lung.
- He has bloody diarrhea likely secondary to GVHD, and his renal function is compromised with muddy brown casts indicating intrinsic renal damage.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and there is concern for GVHD or drug-induced liver injury.
- He has a history of MDS post BMT and is currently on immunosuppressive therapy.
- The patient's bandemia is concerning for infection or bone marrow recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Ischemia/Afib with RVR: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and he requires close monitoring and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, CAD, now with
   pneumonia and ARDS.
   CAD -- evolving acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, ASA and possible cardiac cath
   --> however, not candidate for anticoabulation or ASA (high risk for
   bleed).  Not candidate for cardiac cath (infection).  Plan optimize
   hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue statin.  Attempt trial
   of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.  Consider repeat cardiac
   echo.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirsu).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 60% antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Attributed to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion.  Currently stable, but monitor closely.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro.
   SEPSIS -- Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   RENAL FAILURE -- evolving oliguria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Consider resuming lasix infusion.  Renal US unrevealing for
   obstruction.  Renal consultation in progresss.  Uremia.
   HEMATURIA -- foley trauma, thrombocytopenia and uremia.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- resolved.  Monitor Na.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and coronary artery disease (CAD). He is currently admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has several medical complications and potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure attributed to infection (parainfluenza, adenovirus) and possibly left heart failure. He is on mechanical ventilation to optimize PEEP and decrease FiO2 below 60%. ABG monitoring will be done to maintain pH between 7.35-7.40, pO2 above 60 mmHg, and SaO2 above 90%.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but it was attributed to sepsis and intravascular depletion. Close monitoring is necessary.

3. Pericardial Effusion: A repeat echo may be considered to assess the size of the pericardial effusion.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by parainfluenza and possibly Stenotrophomonas. Antibiotics such as cefepime and ciprofloxacin are being administered.

5. Sepsis: The patient is being treated for sepsis with antibiotics including cefepime, mycofungin"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, CAD, now with
   pneumonia and ARDS.
   CAD -- evolving acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, ASA and possible cardiac cath
   --> however, not candidate for anticoabulation or ASA (high risk for
   bleed).  Not candidate for cardiac cath (infection).  Plan optimize
   hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue statin.  Attempt trial
   of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.  Consider repeat cardiac
   echo.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirsu).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 60% antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Attributed to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion.  Currently stable, but monitor closely.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro.
   SEPSIS -- Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   RENAL FAILURE -- evolving oliguria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Consider resuming lasix infusion.  Renal US unrevealing for
   obstruction.  Renal consultation in progresss.  Uremia.
   HEMATURIA -- foley trauma, thrombocytopenia and uremia.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- resolved.  Monitor Na.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of MDS, CAD, and recent non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation (SCT). He is currently in the ICU due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has multiple comorbidities including evolving acute myocardial infarction (MI), right ventricular (RV) distribution, positive fluid balance, and possible left heart failure. He also has thrombocytopenia, renal failure, sepsis, pericardial effusion, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and pneumonia may lead to persistent respiratory failure. Optimizing PEEP and FiO2 while monitoring ABG is necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Acute MI with RV Distribution: The patient's evolving acute MI with RV distribution requires careful management. Due to his high risk for bleeding, he cannot receive anticoagulation or ASA. A cardiac catheterization is not recommended due to infection. Continuing statin therapy and attempting a trial of beta-blocker if hemodynamically tolerated are part of the plan.
3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis likely caused by parainfluenza and possibly Stenotrophomonas. Appropriate antibiotics such as cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and mycophenolate mofetil should be continued.

   Assessment and Plan
   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, CAD, now with
   pneumonia and ARDS.
   CAD -- evolving acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, ASA and possible cardiac cath
   --> however, not candidate for anticoabulation or ASA (high risk for
   bleed).  Not candidate for cardiac cath (infection).  Plan optimize
   hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue statin.  Attempt trial
   of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.  Consider repeat cardiac
   echo.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirsu).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 60% antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Attributed to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion.  Currently stable, but monitor closely.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro.
   SEPSIS -- Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   RENAL FAILURE -- evolving oliguria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Consider resuming lasix infusion.  Renal US unrevealing for
   obstruction.  Renal consultation in progresss.  Uremia.
   HEMATURIA -- foley trauma, thrombocytopenia and uremia.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- resolved.  Monitor Na.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This condition can lead to further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.

2. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is now presenting with evolving acute myocardial infarction (MI) in the right ventricle. The patient is at high risk for bleeding and cannot receive anticoagulation or aspirin. There is a concern for possible cardiac catheterization and management of CAD.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of renal failure, indicated by oliguria (decreased urine output) and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. This could be due to medication-related nephrotoxicity, hypotension, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

4. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of progression or new infections.

5. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which could be attributed to bone marrow suppression, active bleeding, or uremia.

   of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.  Consider repeat cardiac
   echo.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirsu).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 60% antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Attributed to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion.  Currently stable, but monitor closely.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro.
   SEPSIS -- Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   RENAL FAILURE -- evolving oliguria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Consider resuming lasix infusion.  Renal US unrevealing for
   obstruction.  Renal consultation in progresss.  Uremia.
   HEMATURIA -- foley trauma, thrombocytopenia and uremia.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- resolved.  Monitor Na.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and now presents with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has underlying CAD with evolving acute myocardial infarction (MI) in the right ventricle distribution. Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, aspirin, and possible cardiac catheterization; however, the patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation or aspirin due to high risk of bleeding, and not a candidate for cardiac catheterization due to infection. The plan is to optimize hemodynamics, continue statin therapy, and consider a trial of beta-blocker if tolerated hemodynamically. A repeat cardiac echo is also considered.

The patient's respiratory failure persists and is attributed to infection (parainfluenza and adenovirus) as well as possible left heart failure. Mechanical ventilation is continued to optimize PEEP and decrease FiO2 <60%. Antibiotics are being given, and ABG monitoring will be maintained to keep pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg, and SaO2 >90%. The desire is to maintain a net negative fluid balance, if possible, while minimizing dysynchrony.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, attributed to sepsis and intravascular depletion. Closely monitored"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MDS) status post stem cell transplant (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), who initially presented with diarrhea and was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved with pressure control settings, and arterial blood gas (ABG) values are stable. However, the patient continues to experience hypoxia, which is likely due to pulmonary edema and viral infection with Sternotrophomonas xanthomonas.

2. GNR bacteremia: The patient has possible sepsis with hypothermia, hypotension, and bandemia. A blood culture from the arterial line showed growth of GNR bacteria. The patient has been started on cefepime, and further investigations are needed to determine the source of infection, such as urinary catheter, acalculous cholecystitis, or line infection.

3. Cardiac ischemia/atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient had episodes of AFib with RVR, which required treatment. Troponin levels are elevated, indicating cardiac ischemia. The patient is on amiodarone drip for rhythm control and may require repeat echocardiogram (echo).

4. Hypotension: The patient was weaned off pressure support and received Lasix, but subsequently developed fluid"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of MDS who underwent a stem cell transplant. He was initially admitted for diarrhea and then transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating a possible heart attack. This is a serious condition that requires immediate attention.

2. Shock: The patient has experienced episodes of shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to the organs.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, and he has required increased pressure control settings on the ventilator. ARDS is a severe lung condition that can occur as a complication of sepsis or other underlying illnesses.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's urine output has been low, and there is evidence of acute kidney injury. Renal failure can occur due to various reasons, including medication toxicity or hypoperfusion.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient initially presented with high sodium levels, which may be related to resuscitation fluids and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). This electrolyte imbalance needs to be corrected.

6. Bloody Diarrhea: The patient has experienced bloody diarrhea, which was initially attributed to graft-versus-host disease (GV"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) post stem cell transplantation (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), initially admitted for diarrhea, transferred to the ICU for hypoxia, now sedated and intubated.

The patient has several medical complications that require immediate attention:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His ABGs are stable, and he tolerates PO2 in the 60s. The CXR shows increased congestion, indicating fluid overload. The likely cause of his hypoxia is pulmonary edema versus GVHD in the lung.

2. GNR Bacteremia: The patient has a possible sepsis with hypothermia, hypotension, and bandemia. He was started on cefepime on 6/26.

3. Cardiac Ischemia/Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient had elevated troponin levels, RV hypokinesis, and concerns for CAD versus vasospasm due to pressors. Amiodarone drip was started for rhythm control.

4. Hypotension: The patient has been weaned off pressure support and received lasix, now on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). He may require transfusion if his platelets drop below 20,000.

5. Bloody Diarrhea: The patient had extensive prior work-up including sigmoidoscopy, with the path being consistent with GVHD. Stool volumes have varied with the amount of steroids and immunosuppression the patient has received. He received infliximab on 6/13 and is symptomatically better.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient likely developed hypernatremia from NS resuscitation and high Na in TPN. It has now resolved.

7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is adequate, but he has bright red urine Foley output. His electrolytes were more consistent with prerenal, but he also has intrinsic renal damage from medication. He was started on CVVHD.

8. Acute Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is close to his prior baseline.

9. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are stable, and the differential diagnosis includes GVHD of the liver versus drug effect, cholestasis, and prolonged TPN requirement. An MRCP showed dilation of extrahepatic duct without any stones.

10. Rash: The patient has a rash consistent with GVHD. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's liver enzymes with HISS while on high-dose steroids.

11. MDS post BMT: The patient had a repeat bone biopsy which showed no evidence of active disease.

12. Bandemia: The patient's fever curve is trending"

   Microbiology: Blood culture ([**6-23**]) GNR
   Assessment and Plan
   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, complicated by
   GVHD now with pneumonia and ARDS, sepsis, evolving multisystem organ
   failure.
   CAD -- recent acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, ASA and possible cardiac cath
   --> however, not candidate for anticoabulation or ASA (high risk for
   bleed).  Not candidate for cardiac cath (infection).  Continue to
   optimize hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue statin.
   Attempt trial of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.  Consider
   repeat cardiac echo.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirus).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 60% antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony.
   HYPOTENSION -- Recurrent.  Attributable to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion.  Currently stable, but monitor closely.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.  Doubt tamponade.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro.
   SEPSIS -- Antimicrobial coverage expanded.  Likely attributable to GNR
   bacteremia -->  Vanco, Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   BACTEREMIA -- GNR, concern for either pulmonary source, GI source (GI
   tract, hepatobiliary source), urinary source.  Plan monitor LFTs, check
   abd ultrasound, check lactic acid, consider abd CT (to assess for bowel
   ischemia).
   RENAL FAILURE -- developed anuria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Now on renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
   HEMATURIA -- foley trauma, thrombocytopenia and uremia.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- resolved.  Monitor Na.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid balance
   (50-100 ml/hr)
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Now contribution of uremia --> platelet dysfunction.
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of MDS who underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation (SCT) and developed GVHD.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities, including recent acute myocardial infarction (CAD) and respiratory failure attributed to infection and possible ARDS.
- The patient's current condition includes sepsis, evolving multisystem organ failure, hypotension, pneumonia, ARDS, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, hypernatremia, and elevated liver function tests.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 at 90% and PEEP at 10 cmH2O.
- The patient's fluid balance is positive, and there is concern for left heart failure.
- The patient has a pericardial effusion, but tamponade is not suspected.
- The patient has a central line, arterial line, and dialysis catheter in place.
- The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing intensive care support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and the condition may worsen due to ARDS and infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient is septic, and the infection may progress, leading to further organ dysfunction.
3. Multisystem Organ Failure: The patient's condition indicates evolving multisystem organ failure, which can have a"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, complicated by
   GVHD now with pneumonia and ARDS, sepsis, evolving multisystem organ
   failure.
   CAD -- recent acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, ASA and possible cardiac cath
   --> however, not candidate for anticoabulation or ASA (high risk for
   bleed).  Not candidate for cardiac cath (infection).  Continue to
   optimize hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue statin.
   Attempt trial of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.  Consider
   repeat cardiac echo.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirus).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 60% antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony.
   HYPOTENSION -- Recurrent.  Attributable to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion.  Currently stable, but monitor closely.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.  Doubt tamponade.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro.
   SEPSIS -- Antimicrobial coverage expanded.  Likely attributable to GNR
   bacteremia -->  Vanco, Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   BACTEREMIA -- GNR, concern for either pulmonary source, GI source (GI
   tract, hepatobiliary source), urinary source.  Plan monitor LFTs, check
   abd ultrasound, check lactic acid, consider abd CT (to assess for bowel
   ischemia).
   RENAL FAILURE -- developed anuria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Now on renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
   HEMATURIA -- foley trauma, thrombocytopenia and uremia.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- resolved.  Monitor Na.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid balance
   (50-100 ml/hr)
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Now contribution of uremia --> platelet dysfunction.
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MDS) status post stem cell transplantation (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), initially admitted for diarrhea, transferred to the ICU for hypoxia, now sedated and intubated.

Current assessment and plan:
1. Cholecystitis, acalculous: The patient has a dilated common bile duct (CBD) on ultrasound, and a percutaneous cholecystostomy was placed without complications. Monitoring of pigtail output and follow-up bile culture are recommended. The possibility of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be considered if there is no improvement.
2. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB): The patient has had extensive prior work-up including sigmoidoscopy with pathology consistent with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Infliximab was given on [date]. Grossly bloody diarrhea and coffee ground NG aspirate were observed. Continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip and GI following. ERCP may be considered if IR drainage is unsuccessful.
3. Shock, septic: The patient has hypotension and bandemia, suggesting possible sepsis. Blood cultures were redrawn today. Cefepime was started on [date]. ID recommends re-siting all lines, and discussion with the team is planned.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MDS) post stem cell transplant (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), and initial admission for diarrhea. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and is now intubated.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on pressure control settings and tolerates a PO2 in the 60s. The cause of hypoxia is likely fluid overload and viral infection with Sternotrophomonas xanthomonas.

2. GNR bacteremia: The patient has possible sepsis with hypothermia, hypotension, bandemia, and decreased or absent bowel sounds. Blood cultures have been drawn, and the patient is on cefepime.

3. Hypotension: The patient is on phenylephrine and CVVHD. Transfusion of platelets is recommended if platelets are below 20 (consult heme for further parameters).

4. Dilated common bile duct (CBD): The CBD is 1.6 cm dilated, and a percutaneous cholecystostomy has been placed. There are concerns about acalculous cholecystitis.

5. Bloody diarrhea/coffee ground NG aspirate: The patient has had extensive prior work-up including sigmoidoscopy with pathology consistent with graft versus host disease (GVHD). The patient has been given"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of MDS, s/p SCT, CAD, initially admitted for diarrhea and transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. He is currently intubated and on CVVHD. The patient has multiple medical complications including cholecystitis, gastrointestinal bleed, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, hypoxemia, and others. He has undergone various interventions including percutaneous cholecystostomy, ERCP, and CVVHD. The patient's current medications include phenylephrine, amiodarone, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and others. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholecystitis: The patient has been diagnosed with acalculous cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder without the presence of gallstones. This condition can lead to complications such as gallbladder rupture or peritonitis if not managed appropriately.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has presented with grossly bloody stool and coffee ground NG aspirate, indicating an ongoing gastrointestinal bleed. This can be caused by various factors including peptic ulcer disease, diverticulosis, or GVHD. The patient requires close monitoring and management to control the bleeding and prevent further complications.
3. Septic Shock: The patient has signs of septic shock, characterized by"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, complicated by
   GVHD now with pneumonia and ARDS, sepsis, evolving multisystem organ
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirus).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 60% antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony.
   HYPOTENSION -- Recurrent.  Attributable to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion.  Currently stable, but monitor closely.
   ACALCULOUS CHOLECYSTITIS -- s/p percutaneous drainage last PM.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.  No evidence for tamponade.
   CAD -- recent acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, ASA and possible cardiac cath
   --> however, not candidate for anticoabulation or ASA (high risk for
   bleed).  Not candidate for cardiac cath (infection).  Continue to
   optimize hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue statin.
   Attempt trial of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.  Consider
   repeat cardiac echo.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro.
   SEPSIS -- Antimicrobial coverage expanded.  Likely attributable to GNR
   bacteremia -->  Vanco, Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   At risk for fungal superinfection.
   BACTEREMIA -- GNR, concern for either pulmonary source, GI source (GI
   tract, hepatobiliary source), urinary source.  Abd US suggested finding
   consistent with acalculous cholecystitis.  Monitor serial LFTs, check
   lactic acid, consider abd CT (to assess for bowel ischemia).
   GI BLEED -- underlying GVHD, but now concern for gastritis or PUD. GI
   bleed in context of thrombocytopenia.  GI to consider EGD.
   RENAL FAILURE -- developed anuria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Now on renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
   HEMATURIA -- foley trauma, thrombocytopenia and uremia.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid balance
   (50-100 ml/hr)
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.  Now with contribution of GI
   bleed.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Now contribution of uremia --> platelet dysfunction.
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). He is now experiencing pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, and evolving multisystem organ failure. The patient's current condition is critical, and he remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure attributed to infection (parainfluenza, adenovirus) and may also be a component of left heart failure. The goal is to optimize PEEP and decrease FiO2 below 60%. Monitoring ABG values is important to maintain pH between 7.35-7.40, pO2 above 60 mmHg, and SaO2 above 90%.

2. Hypotension: The patient has recurrent hypotension due to sepsis and intravascular depletion. Close monitoring is necessary.

3. Acalculous Cholecystitis: The patient underwent percutaneous drainage for acalculous cholecystitis.

4. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recent acute myocardial infarction with right ventricular distribution. Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, aspirin, and possible cardiac catheterization. However, the patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation or aspirin due to high risk of bleeding, and cardiac catheterization is contraindicated due to infection. Hemodynamics should be optimized to minimize hypotension, and statin therapy should continue. A trial of beta-blocker can be attempted if tolerated hemodynamically. Repeat cardiac echo should be considered.

5. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by parainfluenza and possibly Stenotrophomonas. Antibiotic coverage has been expanded with cefepime, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, micafungin, and cidofovir.

6. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis due to gram-negative bacterial bacteremia, possibly from a pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or urinary source. Antimicrobial coverage has been expanded.

7. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with gram-negative bacteria, possibly from a pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or urinary source. The underlying cause could be pneumonia, acalculous cholecystitis, or urinary tract infection. Monitoring serial liver function tests and lactic acid levels is important, and an abdominal CT scan may be considered to assess for bowel ischemia.

8. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may be related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), gastritis, or peptic ulcer disease. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) should be considered.

9. Renal Failure: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, complicated by
   GVHD now with pneumonia and ARDS, sepsis, evolving multisystem organ
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirus).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 60% antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony.
   HYPOTENSION -- Recurrent.  Attributable to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion.  Currently stable, but monitor closely.
   ACALCULOUS CHOLECYSTITIS -- s/p percutaneous drainage last PM.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.  No evidence for tamponade.
   CAD -- recent acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Cardiology recommends anticoagulation, ASA and possible cardiac cath
   --> however, not candidate for anticoabulation or ASA (high risk for
   bleed).  Not candidate for cardiac cath (infection).  Continue to
   optimize hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue statin.
   Attempt trial of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.  Consider
   repeat cardiac echo.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro.
   SEPSIS -- Antimicrobial coverage expanded.  Likely attributable to GNR
   bacteremia -->  Vanco, Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   At risk for fungal superinfection.
   BACTEREMIA -- GNR, concern for either pulmonary source, GI source (GI
   tract, hepatobiliary source), urinary source.  Abd US suggested finding
   consistent with acalculous cholecystitis.  Monitor serial LFTs, check
   lactic acid, consider abd CT (to assess for bowel ischemia).
   GI BLEED -- underlying GVHD, but now concern for gastritis or PUD. GI
   bleed in context of thrombocytopenia.  GI to consider EGD.
   RENAL FAILURE -- developed anuria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Now on renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
   HEMATURIA -- foley trauma, thrombocytopenia and uremia.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid balance
   (50-100 ml/hr)
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.  Now with contribution of GI
   bleed.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Now contribution of uremia --> platelet dysfunction.
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple complications. These include respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypotension due to sepsis and intravascular depletion, acalculous cholecystitis that has been percutaneously drained, pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade, and recent acute myocardial infarction (MI) with right ventricular distribution. The patient also has pneumonia caused by parainfluenza and Stenotrophomonas bacteria, sepsis likely caused by gram-negative bacterial bacteremia, bacteremia from an unknown source, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed potentially due to underlying graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), renal failure with anuria and acute tubular necrosis (ATN), hematuria from Foley trauma, thrombocytopenia, and uremia, fluid overload, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), rash consistent with GVHD, and nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia and ARDS. Continued monitoring and optimization of PEEP and FiO2 levels are necessary. Antim"

   Troponins peaked [**3-25**]. RV hypokinesis. Concern for CAD vs vasospasm due
   to pressors. Is preload dependent.  Will continue to seek advice from
   cardio.
   - continue amiodarone drip for rhythm control in the context of recent
   afib and hypotension
   - discuss with cardiology
   - platelets remain low, will not give ASA

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of MDS s/p SCT, CAD, initially admitted for diarrhea, transferred to the ICU for hypoxia, now s/p intubation. He has multiple comorbidities including respiratory failure, GNR bacteremia, hypotension, bandemia, and decreased or absent bone marrow suppression. The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, cholecystitis, gastrointestinal bleed, septic shock, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute myocardial infarction, other shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, hypernatremia, diarrhea, liver function abnormalities, hypoxemia, and more.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Tcurrent: 35.2°C (95.4°F)
- HR: 69 bpm (62-89 bpm)
- BP: 112/51 mmHg (67-175/74-105 mmHg)
- RR: 35 breaths per minute (0-37 breaths per minute)
- SpO2: 95%

The patient has received various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, bactrim), antifungals (micafungin), antivirals (cidofovir), and supportive care measures such as mechanical ventilation, CVVHD, percutaneous cholecystostomy, and more.

The patient's laboratory results indicate several abnormalities, including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, renal dysfunction, liver enzyme elevation, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative fluid balance of 731 mL since 12 AM.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on pressure control ventilation with a tidal volume of 546 mL, respiratory rate set at 32 breaths per minute, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 70%, and an ABG showing a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 99.

The patient's physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular status, skin integrity concerns, and neurological status not assessed.

The patient's care plan involves ongoing monitoring and management of his various conditions, including respiratory failure, GNR bacteremia, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleed, acute renal failure, and others. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, and supportive care agents.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, gastrointestinal bleed recurrence, acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and more."

   Assessment and Plan
   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, complicated by
   GVHD now with pneumonia and ARDS, sepsis, evolving multisystem organ
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirus).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 60% antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony.
   HYPOTENSION -- Recurrent.  Attributable to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion.  Currently stable, but monitor closely.
   ACALCULOUS CHOLECYSTITIS -- s/p percutaneous drainage --> monitor.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.  No evidence for tamponade.
   CAD -- recent acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Continue to optimize hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue
   statin.  Attempt trial of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.
   Consider repeat cardiac echo.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro, Bactrim.
   SEPSIS -- Antimicrobial coverage expanded.  Likely attributable to GNR
   bacteremia -->  Vanco, Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   At risk for fungal superinfection.
   BACTEREMIA -- GNR, concern for either pulmonary source, GI source (GI
   tract, hepatobiliary source), urinary source.  Abd US suggested finding
   consistent with acalculous cholecystitis.  Monitor serial LFTs, check
   lactic acid, consider abd CT (to assess for bowel ischemia).
   GI BLEED -- underlying GVHD, but now concern for gastritis or PUD. GI
   bleed in context of thrombocytopenia.  GI to consider EGD.
   RENAL FAILURE -- developed anuria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Now on renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid balance
   (50-100 ml/hr)
   LEUKOPENIA -- bone marrow failure/suppression vs. medication effect.
   Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.  Now with contribution of GI
   bleed.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Now contribution of uremia --> platelet dysfunction.
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male who underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation (SCT) for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and is now experiencing multiple complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which is attributed to infection (parainfluenza and adenovirus) and possibly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires optimization of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

The patient also has recurrent hypotension, which is believed to be due to sepsis and intravascular depletion. There is evidence of acalculous cholecystitis, and a pericardial effusion has been detected but does not appear to be causing cardiac tamponade. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and recently experienced an acute myocardial infarction (MI) involving the right ventricle. Efforts are being made to optimize hemodynamics and continue statin therapy. A trial of beta-blocker may be considered if tolerated.

The patient has pneumonia caused by parainfluenza and possibly Stenotrophomonas, for which he is receiving multiple antibiotics. He is also suspected to have sepsis with bacteremia, likely due to Gram-negative bacteria, and coverage has been expanded. There is a concern for fungal superinfection"

   Assessment and Plan
   65M s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor SCT for MDS, complicated by
   GVHD now with pneumonia and ARDS, sepsis, evolving multisystem organ
   failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed to infection
   (parainfluenza, adenovirus).  At risk for ARDS, but also markedly
   positive fluid balance (may be component of left heart failure).
   Unclear whether component of GVHD.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 60% antimicrobials.  Monitor
   ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony.
   HYPOTENSION -- Recurrent.  Attributable to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion.  Currently stable, but monitor closely.
   ACALCULOUS CHOLECYSTITIS -- s/p percutaneous drainage --> monitor.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.  No evidence for tamponade.
   CAD -- recent acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Continue to optimize hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue
   statin.  Attempt trial of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.
   Consider repeat cardiac echo.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Cefopime, Cipro, Bactrim.
   SEPSIS -- Antimicrobial coverage expanded.  Likely attributable to GNR
   bacteremia -->  Vanco, Cefepime, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   At risk for fungal superinfection.
   BACTEREMIA -- GNR, concern for either pulmonary source, GI source (GI
   tract, hepatobiliary source), urinary source.  Abd US suggested finding
   consistent with acalculous cholecystitis.  Monitor serial LFTs, check
   lactic acid, consider abd CT (to assess for bowel ischemia).
   GI BLEED -- underlying GVHD, but now concern for gastritis or PUD. GI
   bleed in context of thrombocytopenia.  GI to consider EGD.
   RENAL FAILURE -- developed anuria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Now on renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid balance
   (50-100 ml/hr)
   LEUKOPENIA -- bone marrow failure/suppression vs. medication effect.
   Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.  Now with contribution of GI
   bleed.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Now contribution of uremia --> platelet dysfunction.
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplantation for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient developed pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure. He also has hypotension, acalculous cholecystitis, pericardial effusion, and a history of acute myocardial infarction (MI). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected bacterial infections. He is also being treated for sepsis, bacterialemia, GI bleed, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains critically ill with persistent respiratory failure due to infection (parainfluenza, adenovirus). He is at risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may have a positive fluid balance, which could be contributing to left heart failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient has recurrent hypotension, likely due to sepsis and intravascular depletion. Close monitoring is required.
3. Acalculous Cholecystitis: The patient has acalculous cholecystitis, which was percutaneously drained. Monitoring is needed.
4. Pericardial Effusion: There is a concern for pericardial effusion, possibly related to cardiac issues"

   - repeat cxr to check positioning of ETT tube
   # GNR bacteremia: possible sepsis with hypothermia, hypotension,
   bandemia. Also with very decreased or absent BS.  Blood cxs redrawn
   today.  No longer requiring pressure support.  Lactate WNL.
   - started on cefepime on [**6-26**]. Pt s/p U/S percutaneous cholecystostomy
   with good output from pigtail.
   - Surveillance cultures this am, follow up
   - possible etiology: urinary catheter (resend UA and culture),
   acalculous cholecystitis (RUQ ultrasound [**6-26**]), line infection
   - ID recommends re-siting all lines, art line replaced, will discuss
   need to replace other lines if cxs remain positive.
   # Hypotension: Pressors weaned, pt holding pressures.  On CVVHD.
   - transfuse if needed for platelets <50 due to evidence of GI bleed
   - central line access available
   - standing type and screen
   # Dilated CBD: 1.6 cm by U/S, s/p percutaneous cholecystostomy by IR
   [**6-26**], no complications.  Reluctant to do ERCP at this time given
   bleeding risk with sphincterotomy and good drainage with pigtail
   catheters.

   # Caridac ischemia/Afib with RVR: AM of [**6-24**] elevations.
   Troponins peaked [**3-25**]. RV hypokinesis. Concern for CAD vs vasospasm due
   to pressors. Is preload dependent.  Will continue to seek advice from
   cardio.
   - continue amiodarone drip for rhythm control in the context of recent
   afib and hypotension
   - discuss with cardiology
   - platelets remain low, will not give ASA
   - Hold on cath due to inability to anticoagulate [**2-4**] low plt
   # Acute Renal Failure: likely secondary to cidovir dose. Foley
   irrigated overnight. Started on CVVHD.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MDS) status post stem cell transplantation (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He was initially admitted for diarrhea and transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure due to a likely viral infection with Sternotrophomonas xanthomonas and Parainfluenza Type 3. The patient has also been diagnosed with cholecystitis, acute myocardial infarction, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, and hypoxemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Impaired skin integrity: The patient has pressure ulcers.
- Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has melena and ongoing bloody diarrhea, which is consistent with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
- Septic shock: The patient has hypotension and tachycardia, and there are concerns for sepsis.
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient requires mechanical ventilation, and there are concerns for pulmonary edema versus GVHD in the lung.
- Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury likely secondary to cidofovir dose.
- Dilated common bile duct: The patient has a dilated CBD of 1.6 cm, and a percutaneous cholecystostomy has been placed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of MDS who underwent a bone marrow transplant (BMT) and is now presenting with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory distress, and he has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs indicate tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, decreased blood pressure ranging from 94/43 to 88/43 mmHg, and a temperature of 35.2°C. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on 80% FiO2. The heart rhythm is sinus rhythm with a rate of 80 beats per minute. 

The patient has a history of multiple infections, including a viral infection with Sternotrophomonas xanthomonas and parainfluenza type 3, as well as adenovirus. The patient's current infections include GNR bacteremia, and the source is believed to be from an arterial line. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including cefepime, Bactrim, and meropenem.

The patient also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pulmonary edema versus graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the lung. He has been on increasing FiO2 and pressure control ventilation.

Additionally, the patient has hypotension, likely secondary to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of MDS post stem cell transplantation (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), admitted initially for diarrhea and subsequently transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe ARDS. The patient has a variety of complications including impaired skin integrity, cholecystitis, gastrointestinal bleed, septic shock, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, hypernatremia, diarrhea, liver function abnormalities, and hypoxemia. He is also diagnosed with GNR bacteremia, dilated common bile duct, bloody diarrhea consistent with GVHD, cardiac ischemia/atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and acute anemia. The patient's current treatment plan includes mechanical ventilation on pressure control, administration of antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), blood product transfusions, and other supportive measures. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is at risk for further complications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Progressive respiratory failure due to ARDS.
2. Sepsis or septic shock from ongoing infection.
3. Multiorgan dysfunction due to severe sepsis or ARDS.
4. Renal failure exacerbation or worsening of renal function.
5. Hepatic failure or worsening of liver function abnormalities.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yom s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for
   MDS, complicated by GVHD now with pneumonia and ARDS, sepsis, evolving
   multisystem organ failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent.  Diffuse airspace disease.
   Attributed to infection (parainfluenza, adenovirus), ARDS, component of
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema (LV dysfunction and markedly positive fluid
   balance).  Unclear whether component of GVHD in lungs.  Also consider
   possible alveolar hemorrhage.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 70%.  Continue antimicrobials.
   Monitor ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony --> may require paralysis.
   HYPOTENSION -- Recurrent.  Attributable to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion (significantly net negative fluid balance on CVVH).  Consider
   component of relative adrenal insufficiency (receiving lower dose
   solumedrol).  Currently stablized, but remains on vasopressor and
   condition guarded.  Maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ACALCULOUS CHOLECYSTITIS -- s/p percutaneous drainage --> good output,
   suggesting patent cystic duct and (hopefully) decompression of biliary
   tree.  Monitor drainage.
   CAD -- recent acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Continue to optimize hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue
   statin.  Attempt trial of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.
   Consider repeat cardiac echo.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Bactrim.
   SEPSIS -- Antimicrobial coverage expanded.  Likely attributable to GNR
   bacteremia -->  Vanco, Bactrim, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   Persisitent bacteremia suggests ongoing sequested source, such as
   infected lines.  A-line changed, and idealy would prefer to change
   central venous catheters, but access limited.  Also at risk for fungal
   superinfection (intubated, broad-spectrum antimicrobials, steroids,
   TPN).
   BACTEREMIA -- Persistent GNR bacteremia.  Concern for either pulmonary
   source, GI source (GI tract, hepatobiliary source), urinary source.
   Monitor serial LFTs, check lactic acid, consider abd CT (to assess for
   bowel ischemia).  [**Month (only) 8**] need to replace lines.  High-grade bacteremia
   repeat cardiac echo.
   GI BLEED -- underlying GVHD, but now concern for gastritis or PUD. GI
   bleed in context of thrombocytopenia.  GI to consider EGD if escalates.
   RENAL FAILURE -- developed anuria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Now on renal replacement therapy (CVVH).  Continue.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid balance
   (50-100 ml/hr) if tolerated by BP parameters.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.  No evidence for tamponade.  No tachycardia.
   LEUKOPENIA -- bone marrow failure/suppression vs. medication effect.
   Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.  Now with contribution of GI
   bleed.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Now contribution of uremia --> platelet dysfunction.  Hope to try to
   maintain >50 empirically.
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yom s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for
   MDS, complicated by GVHD now with pneumonia and ARDS, sepsis, evolving
   multisystem organ failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent.  Diffuse airspace disease.
   Attributed to infection (parainfluenza, adenovirus), ARDS, component of
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema (LV dysfunction and markedly positive fluid
   balance).  Unclear whether component of GVHD in lungs.  Also consider
   possible alveolar hemorrhage.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 70%.  Continue antimicrobials.
   Monitor ABG, maintain pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg SaO2 > 90%.  Desire to
   maintain net negative fluid balance, if possible.  Optimize sedation to
   minimize dysynchrony --> may require paralysis.
   HYPOTENSION -- Recurrent.  Attributable to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion (significantly net negative fluid balance on CVVH).  Consider
   component of relative adrenal insufficiency (receiving lower dose
   solumedrol).  Currently stablized, but remains on vasopressor and
   condition guarded.  Maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ACALCULOUS CHOLECYSTITIS -- s/p percutaneous drainage --> good output,
   suggesting patent cystic duct and (hopefully) decompression of biliary
   tree.  Monitor drainage.
   CAD -- recent acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Continue to optimize hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue
   statin.  Attempt trial of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.
   Consider repeat cardiac echo.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Bactrim.
   SEPSIS -- Antimicrobial coverage expanded.  Likely attributable to GNR
   bacteremia -->  Vanco, Bactrim, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   Persisitent bacteremia suggests ongoing sequested source, such as
   infected lines.  A-line changed, and idealy would prefer to change
   central venous catheters, but access limited.  Also at risk for fungal
   superinfection (intubated, broad-spectrum antimicrobials, steroids,
   TPN).
   BACTEREMIA -- Persistent GNR bacteremia.  Concern for either pulmonary
   source, GI source (GI tract, hepatobiliary source), urinary source.
   Monitor serial LFTs, check lactic acid, consider abd CT (to assess for
   bowel ischemia).  [**Month (only) 8**] need to replace lines.  High-grade bacteremia
   repeat cardiac echo.
   GI BLEED -- underlying GVHD, but now concern for gastritis or PUD. GI
   bleed in context of thrombocytopenia.  GI to consider EGD if escalates.
   RENAL FAILURE -- developed anuria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Now on renal replacement therapy (CVVH).  Continue.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid balance
   (50-100 ml/hr) if tolerated by BP parameters.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.  No evidence for tamponade.  No tachycardia.
   LEUKOPENIA -- bone marrow failure/suppression vs. medication effect.
   Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.  Now with contribution of GI
   bleed.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Now contribution of uremia --> platelet dysfunction.  Hope to try to
   maintain >50 empirically.
   Elevated LFTs: Stable. -- attributed to GVDH vs. drug effect.   Also
   consider cholestasis [**2-4**] prolonged TPN requirement.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory failure due to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and possible alveolar hemorrhage. The patient also has hypotension, attributed to sepsis and intravascular depletion, as well as calcified cholecystitis. Other conditions include acute myocardial infarction (MI), pneumonia, sepsis, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and pericardial effusion. The patient is critically ill with a poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia, ARDS, and possible alveolar hemorrhage. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and efforts are being made to optimize PEEP and decrease FiO2. Continuous monitoring of ABG and maintaining pH 7.35-7.40, pO2 >60 mmHg, and SaO2 >90% are essential.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis and intravascular depletion. Vasopressors are being used to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmH"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of multiple sclerosis (MDS) post stem cell transplant (SCT), coronary artery disease (CAD), initially admitted for diarrhea, and subsequently transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by a likely viral infection with Sternotrophomonas xanthomonas and Parainfluenza Type 3.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including GVHD in the lung, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, hypernatremia, diarrhea, liver function abnormalities, hypoxemia, and cardiac ischemia/atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He also has a dilated common bile duct, bloody diarrhea/coffee ground nasogastric (NG) aspirate possibly due to GVHD, and elevated liver enzymes with cholestasis.

The patient has received various treatments including broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, and immunosuppressive medications. He has undergone procedures such as percutaneous cholecystostomy and placement of central lines. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he requires continuous monitoring and management of his multiple organ dysfunctions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at high risk for sepsis due to his immunocompromised state, presence of central lines, and positive blood cultures.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxemia may progress to ARDS, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to AKI, which can result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
4. Hepatic Failure: The patient's liver function abnormalities and cholestasis may progress to hepatic failure, causing coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and other systemic complications.
5. Cardiac Ischemia/Myocardial Infarction: The patient's cardiac ischemia and atrial fibrillation with RVR indicate ongoing cardiac stress, increasing the risk of myocardial infarction.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's bloody diarrhea and coffee ground NG aspirate suggest a risk of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, potentially requiring transfusions and endoscopic interventions.
7. Line-Associated Infections: The presence of central lines increases the risk of line-associated bloodstream infections, which can be serious and difficult to treat.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and aggressive management of his multiple organ dysfunctions are necessary to prevent further complications and improve his chances of recovery."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of MDS s/p SCT and CAD, initially admitted for diarrhea and later transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. He underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities including GVHD, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, hypernatremia, liver function abnormalities, and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient is at risk of pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cholecystitis, acalculous: The patient has dilated common bile duct and may develop acalculous cholecystitis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB): The patient has bloody diarrhea and coffee ground NG aspirate, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Septic shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension and signs of systemic infection, which could progress to septic shock.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome post stem cell transplant, coronary artery disease, initially admitted for diarrhea, and transferred to the ICU for hypoxia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by impaired skin integrity, cholecystitis, gastrointestinal bleed, septic shock, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, myocardial infarction, other shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, hypernatremia, diarrhea, liver function abnormalities, and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can lead to pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
2. Cholecystitis: The patient has acute cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. This can lead to complications such as gallbladder rupture or abscess formation.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can recur and lead to anemia, hypotension, and shock.
4. Septic shock and severe sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to his compromised immune system, which can lead to septic shock and organ dysfunction.

   65M w MDS s/p SCT ([**4-/2126**]), CAD, initially admitted for diarrhea,
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for hypoxia, now s/p intubation.
   # Respiratory failure:  Likely [**2-4**] viral infection w Sternotrophomonas
   xanthomonas [**6-20**]. Parainfluenza Type 3 in nasal swab ([**6-18**]). Adenovirus
   load has decreased. [**Month (only) 8**] also have worsened hypoxia from pulm edema vs
   GVHDz in the lung. S/p intubation [**6-20**]. Clindamycin ([**Date range (1) 7235**]).
   Meropenem d/c
d [**6-28**]. Pt with difficulty on vent overnight, requiring
   increasing FIO2 and ultimately swich to pressure control. Cidofovir
   administered yesterday despite ARF per ID recs.  Difficulty ventilating
   and oxygenating pt overnight.
   - continue PS at 12/17 FiO2 rate 38.  Patient paralyzed to avoid
   dysynchrony with vent. Continue to adequately sedate due to
   paralyzation.
   - continue vancomycin ([**6-18**]- ), continue cipro
   - Bactrim for stenotrophomonas
   - miconazole for fungal coverage
   - continue to follow BCxs, Urine cxs negative
   # Hypotension: Pt with variable blood pressure last 24 hours now on Neo
   and Vaso..  Pt remains >20L positive for hospitalization, likely with
   septic shock given +BCx.  CVVHD restarted last night, pt appears to be
   tolerating. Received stress dose steroid last night.
   - continue pressors as needed, levophed on call should a 3^rd pressor
   be required.
   - central line access available
   - standing type and screen
   # GNR bacteremia: possible sepsis with hypothermia, hypotension,
   bandemia. Also with very decreased BS.  UA, bile cxs negative to date.
   - started on cefepime on [**6-26**], switched to Bactrim when CVVHD started
   according to sensitivities
   - monitor pigtail drain output
   - follow up cxs and continue surveillance
   # Elevated liver enzymes / Dilated CBD: Pt now with what appears to be
   shock liver with AST/ALT significantly elevated since yesterday.
   Previously, CBD foud to be 1.6 cm by U/S, s/p percutaneous
   cholecystostomy by IR [**6-26**], no complications.  Reluctant to do ERCP.
   Final bile cxs negative. Patient in hepatic failure.
   - follow LFTs
   # Bloody diarrhea/coffee ground NG aspirate: Now with pink-tinged,
   guiac positive NG aspirate.  Has had extensive prior work-up including
   sigmoidoscopy [**5-11**] with path being c/w GVHD. S/p inflixumab on [**6-13**].
   Coffee grounds NG aspirate [**6-26**], grossly bloody diarrhea [**6-27**].
   - continue protonix drip
   - continue current immunosuppresion with methylprednisolone,
   budesonide, cyclosporine, and cellcept
   - continue bowel meds
   - follow crit/plt q6 hour
   - maintain platelets >50, will reassess need for further platelet
   transfusion tomorrow given that he is no longer actively bleeding
   # Caridac ischemia/Afib with RVR: AM of [**6-24**] elevations.
   Troponins peaked [**3-25**]. RV hypokinesis. Concern for CAD vs vasospasm due
   to pressors. Is preload dependent.  Appreciate cardiology input.
   - continue amiodarone drip for rhythm control in the context of recent
   afib and hypotension, no need to switch to PO at this point.
   - no aspirin due to low plts.
   # Acute Renal Failure: likely secondary to cidovir dose. Renal
   following.
   - Continue CVVHD, as it likely is helping maintain current acid base
   status from deteriorating.   However, CVVHD running at 100cc positive,
   so may be contributing to fluid status of Mr. [**Known lastname 7111**].
   - Q6 lytes
   - renally dose meds
   # Acute Anemia: Close to prior baseline.
   - Q6 crit
   # Rash: [**2-4**] GVHD. Plan as above. Monitor FS with HISS while on high
   dose steroids. Stable
   # MDS s/p BMT: cured on repeat bone biopsy
   - Continue Cyclosporine (recently redosed), Ursodiol, Acyclovir,
   micafungin, cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide, atovaquone
   - Coordinate with BMT
   - monitor neutrophil count

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yom s/p nonablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for
   MDS, complicated by GVHD now with pneumonia and ARDS, GNR sepsis,
   evolving multisystem organ failure.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent.  Diffuse airspace disease.
   Attributed to infection (parainfluenza, adenovirus), ARDS, component of
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema (LV dysfunction and markedly positive fluid
   balance).  Unclear whether component of GVHD in lungs.  Also consider
   possible alveolar hemorrhage.  Continue mechanical ventilation -->
   optimize PEEP, hope to decrease FiO2 < 70%.  Continue antimicrobials.
   Monitor ABG.  Desire to maintain net negative fluid balance, if
   possible.  Optimize sedation while paralyzed to minimize dysynchrony.
   HYPOTENSION -- Recurrent.  Attributable to sepsis, intravascular
   depletion (significantly net negative fluid balance on CVVH).  Consider
   component of relative adrenal insufficiency (receiving lower dose
   solumedrol) --> now receiving stress-dose steroids.  Currently
   stablized, but remains on vasopressors and condition guarded.  Maintain
   MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ACALCULOUS CHOLECYSTITIS -- s/p percutaneous drainage --> good output,
   suggesting patent cystic duct and (hopefully) decompression of biliary
   tree.  Monitor drainage.
   CAD -- recent acute MI, RV distribution.  Known underlying CAD.
   Continue to optimize hemodynamics (minimize hypotension).  Continue
   statin.  Attempt trial of b-blocker if tolerates hemodynamically.
   Consider repeat cardiac echo.
   PNEUMONIA -- Parainfluenza, and now possibly Stenotrophomonas -->
   Bactrim.
   SEPSIS -- Antimicrobial coverage expanded.  Likely attributable to GNR
   bacteremia -->  Vanco, Bactrim, Mycofungin, Ciprofloxicin, Cidofovir.
   Persisitent bacteremia suggests ongoing sequested source, such as
   infected lines.  A-line changed, and idealy would prefer to change
   central venous catheters, but access limited.  Also at risk for fungal
   superinfection (intubated, broad-spectrum antimicrobials, steroids,
   TPN).
   BACTEREMIA -- Persistent GNR bacteremia.  Concern for either pulmonary
   source, GI source (GI tract, hepatobiliary source), urinary source.
   Monitor serial LFTs, check lactic acid, consider abd CT (to assess for
   bowel ischemia).  [**Month (only) 8**] need to replace lines.  High-grade bacteremia-->
   repeat cardiac echo.
   GI BLEED -- underlying GVHD, but now concern for gastritis or PUD. GI
   bleed in context of thrombocytopenia.  GI to consider EGD if escalates.
   RENAL FAILURE -- developed anuria, concern for medication related and
   hemodynamic (hypotension) --> ATN (muddy brown casts by microscopy).
   Now on renal replacement therapy (CVVH).  Continue.
   FLUIDS -- net volume overloaded.  Desire net negative fluid balance
   (50-100 ml/hr) if tolerated by BP parameters.  However, continues
   require net fluid positive balance.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- consider repeat echo to assess size of
   pericardial effusion.  No evidence for tamponade.  No tachycardia.
   LEUKOPENIA -- bone marrow failure/suppression vs. medication effect.
   Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- bone marrow suppression and active bleeding.  Uremia may be
   contributing to platelet dysfunction.  Now with contribution of GI
   bleed.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continue to transfuse if <10 or active bleeding.
   Now contribution of uremia --> platelet dysfunction.  Hope to try to
   maintain >50 empirically.
   Elevated LFTs -- now with evidence for shock liver.
   RASH -- [**2-4**] GVHD.  Monitor FS with HISS tapering steroids. Cellcept,
   cyclosporin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   MDS s/p BMT --  Continue Cyclosporine, Ursodiol, Acyclovir, micafungin,
   cellcept, methylprednisolone, budesonide.
   Overall, very poor prognosis.  In context of current severe multisystem
   organ failure and continued decline, CPR not indated (medical
   futility).

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male who underwent a non-ablative matched unrelated donor stem cell transplant for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure due to diffuse airspace disease attributed to infection (parainfluenza, adenovirus), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and possible alveolar hemorrhage. The patient is being mechanically ventilated with the goal of optimizing PEEP and decreasing FiO2.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing recurrent hypotension due to sepsis, intravascular depletion, and relative adrenal insufficiency. The patient is currently stable on vasopressors and requires a stress-dose steroid.

3. Acalculous Cholecystitis: The patient had percutaneous drainage for acalculous cholecystitis, which is showing good output, suggesting patent cystic duct and decompression of the biliary tree. Monitoring of drainage is recommended.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient recently experienced an acute myocardial infarction (MI) with right ventricular distribution. The patient has known underlying CAD. Optimizing hemodynamics, continuing statin therapy, and considering a trial of beta-blocker if tolerated are advised. Repeat cardiac echo may be necessary.

5. Pneumonia: The"
