   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent femoral surgery that was complicated by significant intra-operative blood loss. She has also had a myocardial infarction (MI) in the past and has received bare metal stent placement. Additionally, she has metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and has undergone a nephrectomy.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 53-76 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 72/39 mmHg to 159/71 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 14-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature (Tmax) and current temperature (Tcurrent) are both 36.4°C.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an arterial line in place since [**2198-9-19**] 07:50 PM. She was attempted to wean off phenylephrine, but her systolic blood pressures fell into the 70s. A 500cc normal saline (NS) bolus was given, and her blood pressures remained labile in the 70-80s. Neo was started at 1mcg/kg/min.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a total input of 8,479 mL and a total output of 6,"

The patient was admitted for an elective osteotomy but developed significant intraoperative blood loss, resulting in a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) from 30.7 to 26.2 over 12 hours. 

The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation and is receiving supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. Her blood pressure is currently being supported with phenylephrine. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated, and there is a slight decrease in platelet count. The patient's serum creatinine (Cr) level is within normal limits, but there are abnormalities in other electrolytes such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), magnesium (Mg++), calcium (Ca++), phosphorus (PO4), and glucose levels.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is experiencing post-operative hypotension following surgery. They have a history of allergies to penicillins and sulfa medications. The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 67/49 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving vasopressor support to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. They have an arterial line and sciatic nerve catheter in place for pain control. The patient's pain level is reported as mild at a 4-10 scale, located in the right hip.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.9 K/uL, and thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 278 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes show hyponatremia with a sodium level of 122 mg/dL, hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.2 mg/dL, and hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 8.2 mg/dL. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26.2 mg/dL. The patient also has a decreased glucose level of 220 mg/dL.

Imaging reveals an elevated left hemidiaphragm on chest X-ray, which could be due to subpulmonic effusion or post-operative hemidiaphragm paresis. The patient has a history of a left nephrectomy and a bare metal stent placement for coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests anemia, which may result from intraoperative blood loss or ongoing bleeding at the surgical site.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia. These imbalances can affect various bodily functions and may require correction.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine and BUN levels indicate renal dysfunction, which can be attributed to the patient's single kidney and previous left nephrectomy. Close monitoring of urine output, BUN, and creatinine levels is necessary.
5. Respiratory Complications: The elevated left hemidiaphragm may compromise respiratory function, potentially leading to decreased lung expansion and subsequent pneumonia or atelectasis.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to the invasive lines and tubes in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and bare metal stent placement. She also has metastatic renal cell carcinoma and underwent a right femoral surgery complicated by significant intraoperative blood loss. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, pain in the hip, and a stable hematocrit level. She has received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) so far.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding into the hip joint and receiving multiple units of PRBCs indicate a potential risk of further bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to the central line placement, which can lead to catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and surgery, there is a risk of developing DVT.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's history of renal cell carcinoma and recent blood loss may put her at risk for AKI.
5. Cardiac issues: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and previous myocardial infarction make her susceptible to cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory problems: The patient's pain and limited mobility could potentially lead to respiratory complications like pneumonia.
7. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's use of pain medications and"

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","The patient is a postoperative patient who underwent right hip orthopedic surgery. They have been experiencing anemia, likely due to blood loss during the surgery. The patient continues to require packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion to maintain a stable hematocrit (Hct) level above 30. There are no signs of hypotension or pain control issues at this time. The patient's nausea has been well-controlled. Nutritional support is being provided through oral intake.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: Since the patient is already experiencing anemia due to blood loss during surgery, there is a risk of further bleeding, especially if clotting factors are compromised.

2. Infection: Surgical site infections are a common postoperative complication. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, warmth, or drainage at the surgical site, is important.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility after surgery increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Prophylactic measures, such as low molecular weight heparin, are being used to prevent DVT.

4. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular repositioning and careful skin assessment are essential to prevent these.

5. Ventricular Arrhythmias: Anemia can predispose patients to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular arrhythmias."

","Summary:
The patient is a post-operative patient in the ICU who underwent right hip orthopedic surgery. They have been experiencing anemia due to blood loss, likely from bleeding into the surgical field. The patient continues to require PRBC transfusion and their hemoglobin concentration (Hct) needs to be monitored and maintained above 30 (CAD). There is also a consideration for a leg CT scan.

The patient's hypotension has resolved. Pain control is being managed through a PCA pump, nausea is under good control, and nutritional support is being provided orally (PO).

The patient has multiple lines, including a 20-gauge line placed on 9/20/98 at 9:00 AM and a triple introducer placed on 9/20/98 at 4:00 PM. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous UF heparin, systemic anticoagulation with none, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's anemia is likely due to blood loss during surgery. This could potentially lead to further bleeding complications if not managed properly.
2. Infection: The patient is in the ICU, which increases the risk of developing infections. Prophylactic measures are in place, but close monitoring for signs of infection is important.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
- She underwent elective osteotomy for a pathologic right femoral fracture but experienced significant intra-operative blood loss, estimated at 3.5 liters.
- The patient has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but her hematocrit (HCT) level has not increased as expected.
- The patient is currently on a clear liquid diet, receiving pain management with acetaminophen and Dilaudid PCA, and has restarted on standing hydromorphone and piroxicam.
- She has a central line placed, with plans to give another unit of PRBCs and contact orthopedic surgery for further evaluation.
- There are concerns about active bleeding or hemolysis, as well as the possibility of bleeding into the hip joint due to pain and increasing tightness.
- The patient's cardiac disease, specifically CAD with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and bare metal stent placement, is a significant consideration in her management.
- The patient also has a history of RCC and has undergone nephrectomy and multiple surgical interventions.
- There are multiple ongoing assessments and plans, including pain control, cardiac management, volume resuscitation, and oncology management.

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), bare metal stent placement, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). She underwent elective osteotomy with re-cementing for a pathologic right femoral fracture, which was complicated by significant intraoperative blood loss. The estimated blood loss was 3.5 liters prior to achieving hemostasis. She received a total of 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the ICU.

Her hemoglobin (Hct) level is currently 30.4%, which is higher than expected considering the amount of blood loss and transfusions received. This suggests the possibility of ongoing bleeding or hemolysis. The patient is experiencing pain in her left big toe, which she attributes to gouty pain. She has been taking Tylenol for pain relief.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 122/61 mmHg, heart rate of 62 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. She is on a clear liquid diet and has been given Dilaudid 8mg orally every 4 hours as needed for pain.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), bare metal stent placement, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) post nephrectomy. She was admitted for elective osteotomy but experienced significant intraoperative blood loss. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management. 

Key Findings:
- The patient has received a total of 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight due to ongoing blood loss.
- Her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has increased from 26.2% to 30.4% despite the transfusions, suggesting either ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 122/61 mmHg and heart rate of 62 bpm.
- She is on a clear liquid diet and pain control medications.
- The patient has a history of CAD, previous MI, and bare metal stent placement.
- She also has metastatic RCC and underwent surgical repair for a pathologic right femoral fracture.
- There is concern for potential complications such as volume overload due to aggressive fluid resuscitation, ongoing bleeding, or hemolysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume Overload: Due to aggressive fluid resuscitation, there is a risk of fluid overload, which can lead to congestive heart failure (CHF) and pulmonary edema"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill post-operative patient with ongoing anemia and multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg and a heart rate of 61 bpm. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation is 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.5°C.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL and an increased hematocrit of 30.4%. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 12.4 K/uL, and the platelet count is low at 42 K/uL. The creatinine level is within normal limits at 1.2 mg/dL, but the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is high at 26 mEq/L. The electrolyte levels show a low potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L and a high sodium level of 139 mEq/L. The glucose level is elevated at 148 mg/dL.

The patient's coagulation profile reveals an increased prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with a normal international normalized ratio (INR). The cardiac enzymes show a slightly elevated troponin-T level of 0.02 ng/mL. Other laboratory values such as alkaline phosphatase,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill post-operative patient who underwent a right hip/femur debridement and hardware placement. They were found to have anemia post-operatively, which is presumed to be due to bleeding into the operative field. The patient received a total of 11 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and their hemoglobin (Hct) levels have improved. The patient's pain has improved with the use of a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, and they are now tolerating a diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: Although the patient received PRBCs to address the anemia, there is still a risk of ongoing bleeding or re-bleeding, which could lead to further deterioration in Hct levels and potentially require additional transfusions.
2. Infection: The patient underwent a surgical procedure, which carries a risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection such as fever, elevated white blood cell count, and wound drainage would be important.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and the presence of orthopedic hardware. Prophylactic measures should be continued, including the use of compression boots and systemic anticoagulation if indicated.
4. Pneumonia: Immobility and the use of mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of pneumonia. Monitoring for respiratory symptoms such as cough, fever, and increased s"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. She underwent elective osteotomy with re-cementing but experienced significant intra-operative blood loss, estimated at 3.5 liters. The patient has received a total of 8 units of packed red blood cells. Her hematocrit (HCT) level is stable at 29.2%. She has a history of gout and is currently taking colchicine for pain management. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction greater than 55%. She is currently on a clear liquid diet and receiving prophylactic medications including a proton pump inhibitor, subcutaneous heparin, and pneumoboots overnight. The patient has a PICC line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: Given the significant blood loss during surgery, there is a risk of ongoing bleeding or hematoma formation at the surgical site.
2. Infection: The presence of a PICC line increases the risk of infection, particularly if proper care and hygiene practices are not followed.
3. Fluid overload: Considering the patient's history of congestive heart failure, aggressive fluid resuscitation may lead to volume overload and worsen heart function.
4. Gout flare-up: The patient's recent use of colchicine for gout management indicates a potential risk of recurrent gout attacks due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and metastatic renal cell carcinoma. She underwent elective osteotomy and was transferred to the ICU after experiencing significant intraoperative blood loss. The estimated blood loss was 3.5L prior to achieving hemostasis. She has received a total of 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) so far. Her hematocrit (HCT) level is stable at 29.2%. She has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) with bare metal stent placement twice. She also has a pathologic right femoral fracture that required surgical repair. The patient's current medications include aspirin, Plavix, acetaminophen, and po dilaudid for pain control. She also takes colchicine for gout. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/60 mmHg to 110/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature within normal limits. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for toe pain due to gout, for which she received two doses of colchicine. She has allergies to penicillins and sulfonamides. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated"
