","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual admitted to the ICU with an unknown allergy to Tylenol and shellfish-derived products. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in the MICU yesterday, which revealed bleeding from the cardia but no source was identified. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate between 69-100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/65 mmHg to 152/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 24 mL and output of 151 mL over 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of -549 mL. The patient received pantoprazole infusion at a rate of 8 mg/hour and other ICU medications. Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable blood pressure and heart rate within normal limits. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 4.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.7 g/dL, blood glucose level of 100 mg/dL, sodium level of 24 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits. Imaging shows bleeding in the cardia with persisting ooze, with no source identified during the EGD. 

Assessment and plan include rescope in the morning, continue pantoprazole infusion, and perform serial complete blood counts (hcts) every four hours. The patient is on full code status and disposition remains unchanged."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 21 year old college student who presents with otherwise
   asymptomatic melanotic stool and a consistently bloody NG lavage in the
   ED, who has now undergone 2 EGDs which show diffuse oozing consistent
   with a diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis of unclear origin.
   UPPER GI BLEED
   Hematocrits are essentially stable given the fluids he has received.
   [**Month (only) 8**] have an element of  slow ooze but not acute dramatic bleed,
   affirming findings on EGD. Origin of the gastritis is unclear. Likely
   in the setting of increased alcohol intake and history of gastritis and
   esophageal web points toward a possible predilection to
   gastric/esophageal pathology.  Other causes: Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7289**], the rugae
   were not abnormal which would argue against lymphoma, although a biopsy
   could not be obtained. There is no known bleeding history in this
   active young man, nor a family history of bleeding disorders, but an
   acquired factor deficiency or other clotting disorder could lead to
   gastric bleeding.
   - Continue IV PPI drip 8mg/hr
   - serial Hct [**Hospital1 **] as they have been stable for the past 24 hours.
   - 2 units are crossmatched; T+S is current
   - Advance diet to clear liquids today and continue maintenance fluids
   - For eval of portal system: pt is allergic to shellfish, per mother
   has had asthmatic reaction in past to shellfish and she has severe
   allergy as well, so CT contrast would be risky for him; abdominal
   ultrasound should show any significant portal vein pathology cheaply
   and quickly, this is ordered and pending
   - If U/S with presence of large spleen of uncertain etiology, no other
   findings
   - coags normal and bleeding time pending
   SPLEENOMEGALY:
   Unclear etiology at this point. Differential: (hyperplasia ->immune vs.
   RES; congestion, and infiltration (non-malignant vs.neoplastic).
   hemolytic anemia, which patient shows no signs at this point (normal
   LDH) Patient with no known recent infection, i.e EBV, CMV, TB, malaria.
   Autoimmune disorders could be a possibiltiy, but less likely to present
   at this age. Neoplasm is also a possibility, although no other signs
   present at this point. . No history of liver pathology to think of
   congestion.
   - Consider HIV testing if not already done
   - Consider further neoplastic workup of other symptoms present;
   currently low white count of 4.4
   - F/U in outpatient for further evaluation
   HYPERTENSION
   See prior note. High normal BP for now. In setting of possible bleed,
   mild hypertension is not a problem; likely deserves outpatient workup
   given apparent history of grandfather with early MI, and given that pt
   is active athlete with no other apparent risk.
   - follow up in outpatient
   - update d/c summary to include this issue
   HIGH TSH
   In setting of w/u for blood pressure, high TSH was obtained. Free T4 is
   pending. Subclinical hypothyroidism most likely, difficult to evaluate
   in setting of acute medical stress.
   - unlikely to be need for intervention; outpt f/u

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old college student with a chief complaint of melanotic stool and bloody nasogastric lavage. They have undergone two esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) which show diffuse oozing consistent with diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis of unclear origin. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Hematocrits are stable despite receiving 3 liters of normal saline due to orthostatic signs. The patient has a history of increased alcohol intake and gastritis, and an esophageal web. Other potential causes of the bleeding include lymphoma, acquired factor deficiency, or other clotting disorders. The patient has no known bleeding history or family history of bleeding disorders.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastric/esophageal pathology: The patient has a history of gastritis and esophageal web, which increases their risk for gastric/esophageal pathology.
2. Upper GI bleed: The patient is currently experiencing an upper GI bleed, which can lead to significant blood loss and may require transfusion.
3. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the presence of an enlarged spleen, making them more susceptible to infections.
4. Portal vein pathology: The patient's enlarged spleen raises the possibility of portal vein pathology, such as portal hypertension or splenic vein thrombosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 21 year old college student who presents with otherwise
   asymptomatic melanotic stool and a consistently bloody NG lavage in the
   ED, who has now undergone 2 EGDs which show diffuse oozing consistent
   with a diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis of unclear origin.
   UPPER GI BLEED
   Hematocrits have been stable even given the fluids he has received.
   Slow ooze but not acute dramatic bleed, confirmed on EGD. Origin of the
   gastritis is unclear. Likely in the setting of increased alcohol intake
   and history of gastritis and esophageal web points toward a possible
   predilection to gastric/esophageal pathology.  Other causes: Per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 7289**], the rugae were not abnormal which would argue against
   lymphoma, although a biopsy could not be obtained. There is no known
   bleeding history in this active young man, nor a family history of
   bleeding disorders, but an acquired factor deficiency or other clotting
   disorder could lead to gastric bleeding.
   - f/u H. pylori stool antigen
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI for now
   - serial Hct [**Hospital1 **] as they have been stable for the past 48 hours.
   - 2 units are crossmatched; T+S is current
   - continue clear liquids
   - Abdominal U/S:
   - If U/S with presence of large spleen of uncertain etiology, no other
   findings
   - coags normal and bleeding time pending
   SPLEENOMEGALY:
   Unclear etiology at this point. Differential: (hyperplasia ->immune vs.
   RES; congestion, and infiltration (non-malignant vs.neoplastic).
   hemolytic anemia, which patient shows no signs at this point (normal
   LDH) Patient with no known recent infection, i.e EBV, CMV, TB, malaria.
   Autoimmune disorders could be a possibiltiy, but less likely to present
   at this age. Neoplasm is also a possibility, although no other signs
   present at this point. . No history of liver pathology to think of
   congestion.
   - Consider HIV testing if not already done
   - Consider further neoplastic workup of other symptoms present;
   currently low white count of 4.4
   - F/U in outpatient for further evaluation
   - call heme/onc to see if further evaluation should be done
   HYPERTENSION
   See prior note. High normal BP for now. In setting of possible bleed,
   mild hypertension is not a problem; likely deserves outpatient workup
   given apparent history of grandfather with early MI, and given that pt
   is active athlete with no other apparent risk.
   - follow up in outpatient
   - update d/c summary to include this issue
   HIGH TSH
   In setting of w/u for blood pressure, high TSH was obtained. Free T4 is
   pending. Subclinical hypothyroidism most likely, difficult to evaluate
   in setting of acute medical stress.
   - unlikely to be need for intervention; outpt f/u
   - f/u free T4

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 21-year-old college student presenting with asymptomatic melanotic stool and a consistently bloody nasogastric (NG) lavage in the emergency department (ED). The patient has undergone two esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs), which show diffuse oozing consistent with a diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis of unclear origin.

The patient's hematocrit levels have been stable despite receiving fluids, indicating a slow bleed rather than an acute dramatic bleed. The origin of the gastritis is unclear, but it may be related to increased alcohol intake and a history of gastritis and esophageal web, suggesting a possible predilection to gastric/esophageal pathology. Other potential causes, such as lymphoma or clotting disorders, are also being considered.

The patient's abdominal ultrasound (U/S) reveals an enlarged spleen of uncertain etiology. The differential diagnosis includes hyperplasia (immune vs. reactive), congestion, and infiltration (non-malignant vs. neoplastic). Hemolytic anemia is less likely, as indicated by normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Autoimmune disorders are less likely to present at this age, and neoplasm is also a possibility, although no other signs are currently present. There is no history of liver pathology to suggest congestion.

The patient's blood pressure is high normal, and outpatient workup is recommended given the apparent history of hypertension in the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 21 year old college student who presents with otherwise
   asymptomatic melanotic stool and a consistently bloody NG lavage in the
   ED, who has now undergone 2 EGDs which show diffuse oozing consistent
   with a diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis of unclear origin.
   UPPER GI BLEED
   Hematocrits have been stable even given the fluids he has received.
   Slow ooze but not acute dramatic bleed, confirmed on EGD. Origin of the
   gastritis is unclear. Likely in the setting of increased alcohol intake
   and history of gastritis and esophageal web points toward a possible
   predilection to gastric/esophageal pathology.  Other causes: Per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 7289**], the rugae were not abnormal which would argue against
   lymphoma, although a biopsy could not be obtained. There is no known
   bleeding history in this active young man, nor a family history of
   bleeding disorders, but an acquired factor deficiency or other clotting
   disorder could lead to gastric bleeding.
   - f/u H. pylori stool antigen
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI for now
   - serial Hct [**Hospital1 **] as they have been stable for the past 48 hours.
   - 2 units are crossmatched; T+S is current
   - continue clear liquids
   - Abdominal U/S: with splenomegaly at 16cm but no signs of portal htn
   - coags normal and bleeding time pending
   SPLENOMEGALY:
   Unclear etiology at this point. Differential: (hyperplasia ->immune vs.
   RES; congestion, and infiltration (non-malignant vs.neoplastic).
   hemolytic anemia, which patient shows no signs at this point (normal
   LDH) Patient with no known recent infection, i.e EBV, CMV, TB, malaria.
   Autoimmune disorders could be a possibiltiy, but less likely to present
   at this age. Neoplasm is also a possibility, although no other signs
   present at this point. . No history of liver pathology to think of
   congestion.
   - Patient with recent pharyngitis about two weeks prior to admission,
   possible recent infection contributing
   - Consider HIV testing if not already done
   - Consider further neoplastic workup of other symptoms present;
   currently low white count of 4.4
   - F/U in outpatient for further evaluation
   - call heme/onc to see if further evaluation should be done
   HYPERTENSION
   See prior note. High normal BP for now. In setting of possible bleed,
   mild hypertension is not a problem; likely deserves outpatient workup
   given apparent history of grandfather with early MI, and given that pt
   is active athlete with no other apparent risk.
   - follow up as outpatient
   HIGH TSH
   In setting of w/u for blood pressure, high TSH was obtained. Free T4 is
   pending. Subclinical hypothyroidism most likely, difficult to evaluate
   in setting of acute medical stress.
   - unlikely to be need for intervention; outpt f/u
   - f/u free T4

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 21-year-old college student who presented with asymptomatic melanotic stool and bloody nasogastric lavage. The patient has undergone two esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGDs) which showed diffuse oozing consistent with a diffuse hemorrhagic gastritis of unclear origin. The patient's hematocrit levels have been stable despite receiving fluids.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is diagnosed with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to diffuse oozing in the stomach. The origin of the gastritis is unclear, but it may be related to increased alcohol intake and a history of gastritis and esophageal web. Other potential causes include acquired factor deficiency or clotting disorders. The patient's spleen is enlarged at 16cm, but there are no signs of portal hypertension.

The patient's high blood pressure should be evaluated as an outpatient given the family history of early myocardial infarction. The patient also has a high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, which could indicate subclinical hypothyroidism. This will require further evaluation and follow-up.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, as well as prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and they are expected to be discharged home this afternoon. The patient will"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who presented with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. The patient's Hct levels have been stable, and they have begun eating again. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has shown no evidence of additional bleeding.

24-hour events include the patient's history, allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, other ICU medications, and changes to medical and family history. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance indicates a total input of 5,779 mL and a total output of 4,275 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,504 mL.

The patient is not on respiratory support, with an oxygen delivery device none and a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's ABG results are pending.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, with no acute distress or signs of overweight or obesity. The patient's eyes, head, ears, nose, and throat are normal. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal pulse and blood pressure, with no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. Peripheral vascular examination is unremarkable, and respiratory/chest examination reveals clear breath sounds with no crackles, wheezes, or diminished breath sounds. Extremities"
