","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, renal artery stenosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and lung cancer who presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (hematochezia). She underwent a colonoscopy showing fresh and old blood in the colon, and a tagged red blood cell scan which was negative. The patient has not had any bloody stools for the past 24 hours and her hematocrit has remained stable. She is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient initially presented with hematochezia, indicating lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Although her bleeding has stabilized, there is still a risk of re-bleeding or further complications related to her gastrointestinal tract.
2. Coumadin (Warfarin) Overdose: The patient was on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation and experienced bleeding complications. It is essential to monitor her clotting parameters and adjust her anticoagulation therapy appropriately.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events. Close monitoring of her heart rate and rhythm is necessary, and she may require further anticoagulation therapy.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a significant history of coronary artery disease and multiple stents. She should be monitored for signs of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a chief complaint of hematochezia. He has a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, renal artery stenosis, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and cancer. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells and underwent a tagged red cell scan which was negative. He has allergies to statins and muscle aching. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 124/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, ICU medications, and other medications. He is also receiving nutrition and glycemic control in the ICU. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal bleeding. His lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleeding, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, renal artery stenosis, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and cancer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, potential medical complications may include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient presents with hematochezia, indicating lower gastrointestinal bleeding. This could lead to hypovolemic shock if not managed promptly.

2. Coronary artery disease:"

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB):
   Patient presented with LGIB in the setting of recently being started on
   Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. She underwent a colonoscopy which
   showed fresh and old blood in the colon. She then underwent a tagged
   RBC scan which was negative. The patient has not had any bloody stools
   for the past 24 hours and her hematocrit has remained stable.

","Summary:
The patient presented with hematochezia, or lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found to have fresh and old blood in the colon during a colonoscopy. A tagged red blood cell scan was negative, indicating that the bleeding is not coming from the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's hematocrit has remained stable, and she has not had any bloody stools for the past 24 hours. 

The patient has a significant history of coronary artery disease and is on multiple medications including aspirin (ASA) and Plavix. She also has a history of peripheral vascular disease and renal artery stenosis. 

The patient was recently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation after undergoing a lobectomy for lung cancer. Her heart rate has been well controlled, but she experiences episodes of increased heart rate in the mid-100s. 

The patient has chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.0 today. She has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica and is on Prednisone 10mg PO daily. 

In the ICU, the patient is receiving nutrition and has well-controlled blood sugars. She has a PICC line and a peripheral IV line. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is being held due to an acute bleed, and pneoboots are in place. Stress ulcer prophylaxis and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis are not being administered.

","The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hematochezia. He has a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, renal artery stenosis, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and lung cancer. The patient's allergies include Lipitor and Zocor, both causing muscle aching. He received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells on [**6-26**]. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on [**6-26**]. 

On review of systems, the patient's symptoms remain unchanged from admission. Vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), blood pressure ranging from 124/50 to 139/82 mmHg, heart rate between 53-131 bpm, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,782 mL with inputs including 650 mL of IV fluids and 467 mL of blood products. Total output was 1,730 mL with urine output of 800 mL and stool output of 930 mL. The patient received respiratory support but not currently on oxygen. ABG results are pending.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment also not assessed.
