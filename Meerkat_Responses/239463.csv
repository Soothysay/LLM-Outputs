","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a motor vehicle collision (MVC). He presented with neck pain, back pain, knee pain, abdominal pain, and a history of ethanol cirrhosis with anticoagulation on Coumadin. The patient had a multi-lumen line started on 10/27/2172 at 08:34 PM and an arterial line started on 10/28/2172 at 02:00 AM.

The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated, with complaints of increased abdominal pain. A CT abdomen revealed a liver laceration and a large hemoperitoneum. The patient received aggressive resuscitation with blood products, cryoprecipitate, and platelets. Due to the severity of the liver laceration, the patient was taken emergently to the interventional radiology (IR) department for embolization of liver bleeding.

The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with low blood pressure trending down throughout the day. There is concern about a possible small clot in the NG tube, but lavage was clear. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) has been fluctuating, ranging from 14/15. He is now intubated and sedated.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, and coagulopathy. His blood glucose levels have been elevated, indicating potential diabetic ketoacidosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after being involved in a motor vehicle collision (MVC).
- The patient has a history of ethanol cirrhosis and is anticoagulated on Coumadin with a clotted transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).
- The patient presented with neck pain, back pain, knee pain, abdominal pain, and was initially conscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 14/15. However, he became more obtunded prior to intubation and is now sedated and intubated.
- The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/57 to 156/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 37.4°C.
- The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated glucose levels, coagulopathy, and signs of liver damage.
- The patient has been receiving aggressive resuscitation with blood products, cryoprecipitate, and plasma due to ongoing blood loss and coagulopathy.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by a liver laceration, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and acute kidney injury.
- The patient is currently receiving treatment for various complications, including antibiotic prophylaxis, DVT prophylaxis,"

The patient is a 54-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). He has multiple injuries including a cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, rib fracture, thoracic/lumbar/sacral fracture (TLS) without spinal cord injury, liver laceration, and internal bleeding. The patient is intubated and sedated, with ongoing respiratory support. He has a history of ethanol cirrhosis and is anticoagulated on Coumadin with a clotted transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). 

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 125/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 971 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. Liver function tests are abnormal with elevated ammonia levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 54-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). He has a history of cirrhosis and is anticoagulated on Coumadin. The patient underwent an invasive procedure and received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). He also had an arterial line placed and multiple central venous catheters inserted.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Neurologic: The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 14/15 and is intubated and sedated. There is a concern for hepatic encephalopathy.
- Pain: The patient is receiving fentanyl on an as-needed basis.
- Cardiovascular: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure are stable.
- Pulmonary: The patient is intubated and continues to be weaned off the ventilator.
- Gastrointestinal/Abdominal: The patient has a liver laceration and is receiving lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. There is also bloody output from the nasogastric tube.
- Nutrition: Total parenteral nutrition (TF) is to be initiated.
- Renal: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with a baseline mild chronic kidney disease (CRI). There is concern for contrast nephropathy.
- Hematology: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) is stable at 24%, and bleeding has been controlled."
