","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of spina bifida, hypercarbic respiratory failure on chronic ventilator support, recurrent urinary tract infections, and sepsis. The patient currently has GPR/GNR in sputum and pan-resistant E. Coli in urine. The patient is on multiple antibiotics, including cefepime and vancomycin, and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has acute kidney injury, chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure dependent on the ventilator, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. The patient's condition is improving, but there are several ongoing concerns and treatment plans.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. Pan-resistant E. Coli in urine: The presence of pan-resistant E. Coli indicates that the bacteria is resistant to multiple antibiotics, making it difficult to treat the urinary tract infection. This increases the risk of treatment failure and potential complications.
3. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for HAP/VAP, which are types of lung infections that can develop during hospitalization or as a result of mechanical ventilation. These infections can be serious"

   (renally dosed), but will defer double pseudomonas coverage given h/o
   allergy to quinolones.
   - Positive UA, cultures pending.  cefepime/vanco would cover most
   organisms that would cause UTI.  will further change antimicrobial
   coverage with culture data
   - Decubitus ulcer: will cover with vancomycin for skin flora.
   - also question of L pleural effusion not well characterized on
   portable CXR and possibly worse from CXR on [**3-21**] (no films to compare;
   only report from OSH); may consider PA/Lat with decub if patient
   tolerates; or CT, or can consider US to eval for pleural effusion and
   if large enough to do thoracentesis.  No acute need for thoracentesis
   at this time since patient is stable from a respiratory standpoint,
   though could be infectious source.
   - blood culture pending; urine culture pending; for hyponatremia and
   pneumonia, will send urinary legionella antigen.  Culture with temp

","The patient is a 37-year-old male with spina bifida, a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure on chronic ventilator support, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and sepsis. He presents with fever and an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level, suggesting an ongoing infection. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia and hypotension, which are consistent with sepsis. The chest X-ray shows a left lower lobe infiltrate, which could indicate hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently on chronic ventilator support and has a history of recurrent UTIs. The patient also has a stage IV decubitus ulcer.

The initial assessment and plan include coverage for potential sources of infection, such as HAP/VAP, positive urine analysis (UA), and stage IV decubitus ulcer. The patient is started on cefepime and vancomycin for empirical coverage, deferring double pseudomonas coverage due to an allergy to quinolones. The antibiotic regimen will be adjusted based on culture results.

Other issues include acute kidney injury (AKI), likely secondary to hypotension/sepsis, and chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure dependent on ventilator support. The patient's electrolyte imbalances, such as hypon"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with spina bifida, who has been on chronic ventilatory support. He was admitted with sepsis and dense left-sided pneumonia, along with a pleural effusion, urinary tract infection (UTI), and stage 4 sacral decubitus (pressure ulcer). The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF).

24-hour events include fever and positive sputum culture for panresistant E. coli. However, the patient is currently stable and receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to sources mentioned above, including panresistant E. coli in the urine. He will continue receiving cefepime/vancomycin until the results of meropenem and cefepime sensitivity tests are available. This will help cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and MRSA ulcer.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is improving, likely due to sepsis and hypotension.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has left pleural effusion and atelectasis on admission chest X-ray. He was placed on assist-control (A/C) ventilation with a tidal volume of 650 mL, 50% FiO2, and PEEP 5. The tidal volume was decreased by 100 mL to avoid overdist"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with spina bifida, a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure on chronic ventilator support, recurrent urinary tract infections, and sepsis. He is currently experiencing gram-positive and gram-negative rods in his sputum and pan-resistant E. Coli in his urine. The patient's recent events include growing pan-resistant E. Coli in his urine, with sensitivities pending. He is being maintained on current vancomycin and cefepime due to decreasing white blood cell count and absence of fever. A chest X-ray shows a likely large effusion on the left side. The patient has allergies to Gatifloxacin, Bactrim, Seroquel, and latex. His last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 03/24 at 09:37 PM and cefepime on 03/25 at 06:00 AM. He is receiving various ICU medications and has had changes to his medical and family history. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. His vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings are provided. The patient's labs and radiology results are also included.

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of spina bifida and chronic ventilator dependence. He presents with sepsis, dense left-sided pneumonia, pleural effusion, urinary tract infection (UTI), stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
- Heart rate: 78 bpm (normal range: 75-93 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 112/72 mmHg (normal range: 97/57-126/77 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute (normal range: 18-28 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on ventilator

The patient's recent events include an E. coli UTI, which is sensitive to cefepime. He has allergies to gatifloxacin, Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), Seroquel (quetiapine fumarate), and latex. His last dose of antibiotics was cefepime on 03/25/2129 at 06:00 AM, followed by vancomycin at 08:30 AM on the same day.

The patient is receiving several medications, including famotidine (Pepcid) and other ICU medications. He has been on a ventilator and requires respiratory support. His fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1308 mL since midnight.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 17 mEq/L. Other lab results, including platelet count, blood glucose, liver function tests, and electrolyte levels, are also provided.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds on the right side but diminished breath sounds on the left side, along with a tracheostomy in place. His extremities are contracted and his skin is not assessed. Neurological examination is also not performed.

The patient's assessment includes sepsis with multiple sources, acute renal failure (likely pre-renal), and respiratory failure due to left pleural effusion, pneumonia, and atelectasis. The plan is to continue cefepime and vancomycin to cover nosocomial pneumonia, E. coli UTI, and skin flora. The patient is hemodynamically stable and can return to rehabilitation with a 2-week course of antibiotics. Bronchoscopy is planned to evaluate the left side."

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yo male with spina bifida, chronically on the ventilator, here with
   sepsis and dense L-sided pneumonia, pleural effusion, UTI, stage 4
   sacral decub, and ARF.
   1. Sepsis- sources listed above.  Continue cefipime to cover GNR in
   sputum (ID still pending), ecoli UTI.  Hemodynamically stable.
   2. Acute renal failure.  Likely pre-renal, improved.
   3. Respiratory Failure.  Left pleural effusion/pna/atelectasis.
   Tolerating home vent settings, though no improvement in rpt CXR
   yesterday.  Will bronch today to look at L side to determine if he has
   chronic focal obstruction.  Dyspena resolved.
   Clinically stable, can return to rehab w/2wk course of abx, pending
   further info on sputum cx.

","The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of spina bifida, who is chronically on the ventilator. He presents with sepsis, dense left-sided pneumonia, pleural effusion, urinary tract infection (UTI), stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer, and acute renal failure (ARF). 

Key findings include:
- The patient has an elevated temperature of 37.4°C and heart rate of 78 bpm.
- Blood pressure is within normal limits, ranging from 112/72 to 126/77 mmHg.
- Respiratory rate is set at 12 breaths per minute with spontaneous respiration not assessed.
- Oxygen saturation is maintained at 98% on ventilator support.
- The patient's weight is 92.2 kg, which is unchanged from admission.
- Fluid balance shows an input of 1,112 mL and output of 2,420 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,308 mL.
- Respiratory support indicates the patient is on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode with a set tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.
- Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds on the right side, diminished breath sounds on the left side, and soft, non-tender abdomen."

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with spina bifida, a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure on chronic ventilator support, recurrent urinary tract infections, and sepsis. He is currently experiencing pseudomonas in his sputum and pan-resistant E. Coli in his urine. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and has had positive cultures for gram-positive and gram-negative rods, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He has shown improvement in his sepsis but still requires ongoing treatment. The patient also has an acute kidney injury and chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, both of which require specific management. Additionally, he has diabetes mellitus and hypertension, but these conditions are currently being managed at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's chronic ventilator dependence puts him at risk for developing VAP. The presence of pseudomonas in his sputum further increases this risk. The plan is to perform a bronchoscopy to evaluate the left lower lobe collapse and assess for any underlying process.

2. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a decubitus ulcer that requires appropriate wound care. If not properly managed, it can lead to worsening of the ulcer and potential infection.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: Although the patient's initial C. diff test was negative, a second test is pending. If positive, it would require specific"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis and pulmonary infiltrate. He has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure and chronic ventilator support. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds and dullness on percussion in the chest area, as well as cool skin with a decubitus ulcer. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin at 8.4 g/dL, elevated potassium levels at 5.9 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 128 mEq/L. Blood cultures have identified E. coli in the urine and Pseudomonas in the sputum. Imaging reveals extensive left-sided collapse with suggestion of left mainstem patency and likely underlying infiltrate.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to multi-lobar collapse contributing to chest wall restriction and poor cough. Antibiotics have been prescribed to treat pneumonia. Metabolic acidosis is suspected, but further evaluation is needed. Acute renal failure is also identified, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of spina bifida, chronic ventilator support, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and previous hypercarbic respiratory failure. He presented with sepsis characterized by hypotension, fever, left lower lobe infiltrate, and positive urinalysis. Currently, he is being treated for pseudomonas in his sputum and pan-resistant E. coli in his urine. The patient has several medical conditions including acute kidney injury, chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure dependent on ventilator support, diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition indicates improvement but requires continued treatment with contact precautions and completion of a full 15-day course of cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's kidney function is improving, but further evaluation is needed. Restarting furosemide may be considered given stable blood pressure and increasing edema.
3. Chronic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on ventilator support for respiratory failure. Current vent settings should be continued, and respiratory therapy should follow up with the patient.
4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient is refusing insulin subcutaneous (ISS), so home diabetic medications (metformin, glipizide) should be continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of spina bifida, chronic ventilatory support, and recurrent urinary tract infections. He is currently experiencing sepsis, as indicated by symptoms such as hypotension, fever, and a left lower lobe infiltrate. The patient also has pseudomonas in his sputum and pan-resistant E. coli in his urine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis needs to be managed aggressively. He has shown improvement, but the source of infection (sputum/urine) still needs to be addressed. Continued administration of appropriate antibiotics, such as cefepime, is necessary for a full 15-day course.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is improving from AKI but requires careful monitoring. Holding furosemide for now may be considered, but restarting it can be considered given the stable blood pressure and increasing edema.
3. Chronic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on ventilatory support and requires continued monitoring and management of respiratory function. Bronchoscopy is planned to evaluate any process causing left lower lobe collapse.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a spinal deformity admitted to the ICU for sepsis and pulmonary and urinary sources that are both sensitive to Cefepime. He has undergone a bronchoscopy, which revealed no significant airway obstruction but did show severe narrowing of the left lower lobe bronchus opening, likely contributing to chronic collapse. This could be an anatomic variant worsened by the LLL collapse. The patient's respiratory failure is due to chronic chest wall restriction leading to chronic ventilatory failure, as well as chronic LLL collapse with proximal airway narrowing. He also has pneumonia, providing an acute challenge.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 137/91 to 163/101 mmHg, heart rate of 106 bpm with a normal sinus tachycardia, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and low glucose level. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Respiratory Failure:
   - Chronic chest wall restriction causing chronic ventilatory failure
   - Chronic LLL collapse with proximal airway narrowing
   - Acute pneumonia challenge

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a spinal deformity, admitted to the ICU for sepsis. He has shown improvement and was found to have pulmonary and urinary sources of infection, both sensitive to cefepime. A bronchoscopy revealed no significant airway obstruction but did show narrowing of the left lower lobe bronchus, likely contributing to chronic collapse. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to chronic chest wall restriction leading to chronic ventilatory failure, as well as chronic left lower lobe collapse with proximal airway narrowing. The pneumonia appears to have caused acute decompensation. The patient's current plan includes continuing cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), re-culture for spike, and chest PT. The patient's sepsis has improved, and acute renal failure has resolved. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TF) and maintaining good glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to a rehabilitation/long-term care facility."
