   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo M with MMP including CAD, CHF, CRI here with GIB and chest pain.
   .
   1. GI bleed: Hx GI bleeding in the past, recent EGD by GI showed
   erosions in stomach and duodenum c/w NSAID gastropathy (only takes
   ASA), had a normal [**Last Name (un) **] in [**Month (only) 1996**].
   - monitor HCTs q4hrs initially and then less frequently if stable
   - 2 large bore IVs in place
   - IVFs PRN
   - Transfuse for HCT < 30 given ? of active ischemia
   - IV PPI
   - F/u GI recs: no plan to scope emergently, await resolution of chest
   pain
   .
   2. Chest pain:
   - telemetry
   - cards recs: repeat Echo
   - F/U CE's
   - F/U cards recs: plan for TTE tomorrow
   - continue statin,
   - restart b-blocker, ACE-I  tomorrow if stable
   - restart ASA if Hct stable in AM
   .
   3. Systolic heart failure: Currently satting well on 2L
   - Hold lasix and spironolactone overnight and restart in AM if patient
   is stable
   - Continue digoxin for afterload reduction
   - monitor I/O's, daily weights
   .
   4. Afib:
   - continue mexilitine and digoxin  (held sotalol last night)
   - s/p reversal of INR given GIB. Will hold off on further
   anticoagulation for now except for ASA in AM
   .
   5. Chronic renal insufficiency: BL cr 1.6-2. Currently at baseline.
   - avoid nephrotoxins if possible
   - keep MAP >60.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). 

The patient's current condition is stable with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/60 to 108/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.1 C (96.9 F) and his peripheral pulses are present in all extremities. 

The physical examination reveals a hyperdynamic point of maximal impulse (PMI) and a systolic murmur. The abdomen is soft with mild tenderness in the bilateral lower quadrants, and no rebound or guarding is noted. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and is oriented to time, place, and person.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.5 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 32.8%, platelet count of 134,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 27 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.0 mg/dL, and troponin T of 0.01 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes prior gastrointestinal bleeding, for which an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed erosions consistent with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) gastropathy. The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction (MMP), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and asthma.

The plan includes monitoring the patient's Hcts every four hours initially and then less frequently if stable, maintaining two large bore intravenous lines, administering intravenous fluids as needed, and transfusing if the hemoglobin falls below 30 g/dL in the presence of active ischemia. The patient will also receive intravenous pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and will be advised to restart aspirin if his Hct is stable in the morning.

Regarding the patient's chest pain, telemetry monitoring has been initiated, and cardiology recommendations include repeating an echocardiogram and following up with cardiac enzymes. The plan is to perform a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) tomorrow and continue statin therapy. The patient's beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor will be restarted tomorrow if the patient remains stable, and aspirin will be restarted if the Hct is stable in the morning.

The patient's systolic heart failure management includes holding lasix and spironolactone overnight and restarting them in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding, and asthma. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with complaints of chest pain and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. GI bleed/Abd pain: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and recent endoscopy showed erosions in the stomach and duodenum consistent with NSAID gastropathy. There is also trace guaiac positive stool, indicating possible ongoing bleeding. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and fluid status is necessary.
2. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain may be due to ischemic heart disease or other cardiac issues. Telemetry monitoring, repeat echocardiogram, and cardiac enzyme levels should be checked. Further management will depend on the results.
3. Systolic heart failure: The patient may have systolic heart failure, as evidenced by his low blood pressure and need for isotropic support. Monitoring of intake and output, daily weights, and avoidance of diuretics are recommended.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently on medication for atrial fibrillation. Close monitoring of heart rhythm and consideration for anticoagulation are important.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, indicating chronic renal insufficiency. Care should be taken to avoid nephrotoxic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of multi-vessel myocardial infarction (MMP), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and ischemic colitis. The patient presented with chest pain and was found to have erosions in the stomach and duodenum consistent with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) gastropathy. There is a history of previous GI bleeding, but no emergent endoscopy is planned at this time. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has stabilized at 32%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed/Abd pain: The patient's history of GI bleeding, erosions in the stomach and duodenum, and trace guaiac positive stool indicate a potential risk for further GI bleeding. Monitoring HCTs regularly and transfusing for HCT < 30 if active ischemia is present will help manage this complication.
2. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain requires further evaluation, including telemetry, cardiac recommendations such as a repeat echo, and follow-up cardiac enzymes. Restarting beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and aspirin if Hct stable in the morning should be considered.
3. Systolic heart failure: The patient may have systolic heart failure, as evidenced by the need to hold diuretics and continue digoxin for after"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo M with MMP including CAD, CHF, CRI here with GIB and chest pain.
   .
   1. GI bleed/Abd pain: Hx GI bleeding in the past, recent EGD by GI
   showed erosions in stomach and duodenum c/w NSAID gastropathy (only
   takes ASA), had a normal [**Last Name (un) **] in [**Month (only) 1996**]. Also consider ischemic colitis,
   particularly given risk factors (low CO, diuretics).  A CTA of the
   abdomen in [**Month (only) 1996**] when he had a similar episode revealed no acute
   abnormality but did show narrowing at the proximal aspect of the celiac
   axis but normal SMA/[**Female First Name (un) **]. Pt has had no further BMs since admission but
   has been NPO.
   - Hct stabilized ~ 34
   - 2 large bore IVs in place
   - IV PPI: switch to PO PPI
   - GI recs: no plan to scope emergently, recent scope done and Hct
   stable
   - Will ask GI about possible ischemic colitis given clinical picture
   - Continue CTX/flagyl while pt still having pain and ischemic colitis
   is in differential, given risk of gut bacteria translocation
   - Advance to clears
   - No imaging at this time given overall reassuring and improving
   clinical picture
   - Held diuretics: concern is restarting could exacerbate possible
   ischemic colitis, continue to hold for now given pt still having sxs
   and does not seem fluid overloaded currently
   - D/W pt
s cardiologist, plan is to d/c coumadin given risk/benefit
   .
   2. Chest pain: Pain has been ongoing intermittently, similar to past
   pain. Unlikely to be active cardiac ischemia given time course, pain
   not typical for aortic dissection.
   - telemetry
   - repeat Echo yesterday
 no significant change from prior
   - CE: negative thus far
   - continue statin
   - restart b-blocker, ACE-I  tomorrow if stable
   - restart ASA if Hct stable in AM
   - poor candidate for aortic valve replacement
   .
   3. Systolic heart failure: Currently satting well on 2L, has not
   received diuretics x 2 days.  Echo yesterday similar to prior, with EF
   20-25%, mod to severe AS, moderate MR; compared with prior,. Increased
   dilation of the aortic sinus and increased MR since prior study.
   - Hold lasix and spironolactone
   - Continue digoxin for afterload reduction
   - monitor I/O's, daily weights
   .
   4. Afib:
   - continue mexilitine and digoxin  and sotolol
   - s/p reversal of INR given GIB, plan per his cardiologist is to d/c
   coumadin
   .
   5. Chronic renal insufficiency: BL creat 1.6-2. Currently at baseline.
   - avoid nephrotoxins if possible
   - keep MAP >60.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He presented to the ICU with chest pain and was found to have erosions in the stomach and duodenum consistent with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) gastropathy. The patient is currently on various medications including morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and metronidazole.

Potential medical complications:
1. GI bleed/Abd pain: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and recent erosions in the stomach and duodenum. There is a concern for ischemic colitis given the risk factors such as low cardiac output and use of diuretics. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has stabilized at around 34.
2. Chest pain: The patient continues to experience ongoing chest pain, which may or may not be related to cardiac ischemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
3. Systolic heart failure: The patient has a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-25% and moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AS). The recent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows increased dilation of the aortic sinus and increased mitral regurgitation (MR) since the prior study.
4. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient is on multiple medications for rate and rhythm control, including mexilitine, digoxin, and sotalol. The plan is to discontinue warfarin due to the risk of bleeding and consult with the cardiologist regarding further management.
5. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are elevated, and precautions should be taken to avoid nephrotoxins and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is on a statin for lipid management.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on levothyroxine for thyroid hormone replacement.
8. Asthma: The patient is to continue his home asthma medications.
9. Psychiatric issues: The patient's psychiatric medications are to be continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain and diaphoresis. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on Coumadin for anticoagulation therapy. However, due to the risk of bleeding and stroke, it was decided to discontinue Coumadin. The patient also has a possible diagnosis of ischemic colitis as the cause of his symptoms.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1 C (97 F), heart rate ranging from 75-79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/61-114/78 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 10-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -1190 mL since midnight. His blood products and urine output are within normal limits. The patient's respiratory support is provided through mechanical ventilation, and his ABG results are pending.

Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities in the general, HEENT, lung, heart, abdomen, extremities, and neurologic assessments. The patient's lab results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The creatinine level is slightly elevated, while the troponin T level is within normal limits. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical problems including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, gastrointestinal bleeding, and asthma. He was admitted to the ICU for chest pain and is currently being treated for several conditions including suspected ischemic colitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and asthma. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is receiving appropriate medications for his conditions. However, there are potential medical complications that can arise such as worsening of ischemic colitis due to the administration of diuretics, exacerbation of atrial fibrillation, development of further gastrointestinal bleeding, or worsening of renal function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is currently admitted to the ICU with ongoing chest pain and a history of ischemic colitis. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as indicated by a low ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25% and moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis (AS). He also has atrial fibrillation (AF), for which he is taking anticoagulants, although these have been discontinued due to the risk of bleeding. The patient's electrolytes and renal function are being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed/Abd pain: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and recent erosions in the stomach and duodenum consistent with NSAID gastropathy. Ischemic colitis is also a possibility given the decreased cardiac output and use of diuretics. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has stabilized at around 34, indicating that there is no further significant bleeding at present.
2. Chest pain: The patient's chest pain has been ongoing intermittently and is similar to past pain. While it is unlikely to be active cardiac ischemia, further evaluation is necessary to rule out other causes such as aortic dissection.
3. Systolic heart failure: The patient"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and lower abdominal pain, with concerns for possible ischemic colitis. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation (Afib), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and asthma.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.3Â°C (97.4Â°F)
- Heart rate: 75 bpm with a range of 75-79 bpm
- Blood pressure: 92/54 mmHg, with a range of 64-114/28-78 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute, with a range of 10-26 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 94% on room air

The patient has received several medications, including ceftriaxone, metronidazole, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole (Protonix), synthroid, mexilitine, seroquel, fluticasone inhaler, citalopram (Celexa), digoxin, and aspirin.

The patient's laboratory results show:
- Hemoglobin: 11.7 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 7.0-7.4 K/uL
- Platelet count: 134-121 K/uL
- Creatinine: 2.0-1.5 mg/dL
- Troponin-T: 0.01-0.02 ng/mL
- Glucose: 92-68 mg/dL
- Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

The patient's physical examination reveals:
- General appearance: No acute distress, overweight/obese
- Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, systolic murmur
- Respiratory/chest: Clear breath sounds, symmetric expansion
- Abdominal: Soft, non-tender
- Extremities: Absent pulses in both radial and distal pulses, no cyanosis
- Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately

The patient's plan includes holding diuretics to avoid hypoperfusion of the bowels, continuing empiric antibiotics for gram-negative coverage, providing antiemetics, advancing diet slowly, restarting home Advair for asthma, and continuing the current regimen for CAD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ischemic colitis, development of Clostridioides difficile infection due to antibiotic use, exacerbation of atrial fibrillation, and further deterioration of renal function.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note."
