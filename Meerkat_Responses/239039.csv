","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and recent nonadherence to blood pressure medications. He presents with acute airway obstruction. The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation. He has been diagnosed with angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitors, for which he is receiving continuous intravenous steroids, benztropine, and an H2 blocker. He also has chronic aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by his CT scan, although there are no active signs of infection. He is being treated empirically with ceftazidime and metronidazole. His blood pressure medications are being held due to his angioedema, and he may be restarted on a beta-blocker and calcium-channel blocker as needed. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate in the mid-40s, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, but his white blood cell count is slightly elevated. The patient has poor dental status and is experiencing throat discomfort. He is expected to undergo evaluation by an ENT specialist and anesthesia team for potential extubation with the assistance of a fiberoptic scope. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The patient is currently"

   # neck swelling: given response to steroid/benadryl/h2 blocker and
   possible recent (discussed with pharmacy [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6514**], he has new first
   time perscribtion for lisinopril 10 mg from [**10-24**], and picked
   it up couple days later) is most likely due to angioedema, in
   differential also SVC syndrome given rapid rise of neck edema w/o
   facial edema, and hx of ca. possible also localized infection of neck
   given poor dentition but less likely as no focal fluctuation, fever,
   leucocytosis. To consider also would be bleed with rapid expansion of
   hematoma.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and recent new blood pressure medications. The patient presented with acute airway obstruction. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Angioedema: The patient's recent prescription for lisinopril, which is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, may be contributing to angioedema. This condition is characterized by swelling of the lips, tongue, throat, or face, and can lead to airway obstruction.

2. Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome: The rapid rise of neck edema without facial edema, along with the patient's history of cancer, raises the possibility of SVC syndrome. This occurs when there is obstruction of the superior vena cava, leading to swelling and congestion in the upper body.

3. Localized infection of the neck: Poor dentition is mentioned in the physical examination, which may suggest an increased risk of localized infection. However, the absence of fever, focal fluctuation, and leukocytosis makes this less likely.

4. Bleeding: The presence of a rapid rise in hematoma could indicate bleeding, potentially related to recent interventions or underlying coagulopathy.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient's ventilation problems secondary to airway obstruction may progress to respiratory failure if not managed promptly. There is also concern for aspiration pneumonia due to chronic aspiration"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, motor vehicle accident, and hypertension. He is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure, suspected to be caused by angioedema induced by ACE inhibitors. The patient also has impaired skin integrity and a history of alcohol abuse. He has multifocal pneumonia on CT chest, likely due to aspiration, and is being treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole. His vital signs are stable, but he has bradycardia with a first-degree heart block, possibly exacerbated by propofol. The patient requires further evaluation for poor dentition and is expected to start nutritional support once able to pass a nasogastric (NG) tube. Social support is also important for the patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should implement appropriate measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and daily wake-up trials to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT. The patient should be provided with appropriate compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation as prophylaxis.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and recent use of new blood pressure medications. He presented with acute airway obstruction. The patient has been extubated and is now on supplemental oxygen via face mask.

Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient experienced bradycardia overnight, which was treated with a bolus sedation of fentanyl and versed.
2. QTc prolongation: The patient's EKG showed a QTc of 487, indicating QTc prolongation. This could increase the risk of developing torsades de pointes, a potentially life-threatening type of abnormal heart rhythm.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has chronic aspiration pneumonia, as indicated by opacification at the bases of the lungs on the chest X-ray. This condition can lead to respiratory infections and worsening lung function.
4. Angioedema: The patient likely has angioedema due to ACE inhibitors, as evidenced by neck swelling. This condition can cause airway obstruction and is a medical emergency.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on antihypertensive medications. However, it is mentioned that the patient's blood pressure should be monitored closely.
6. Prostate cancer: The patient has a history of prostate cancer, which may require further management or treatment.
7. Poor dental status: The patient has poor dental status, which increases"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. He is on multiple antibiotics, including Ceftazidime, Ceftriaxone, Metronidazole, and Clindamycin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 150/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and has a fluid balance of +851 mL. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, PaO2 of 186 mmHg, and a ventilation/perfusion ratio of 29. The patient's lab results indicate normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, total bilirubin, and electrolytes. However, the patient has elevated levels of lactate, LDH, and liver enzymes. The patient's physical examination reveals impaired skin integrity, but no other abnormalities. The patient's medical history includes alcohol abuse. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and recent new blood pressure medications who presents with acute airway obstruction. The patient was intubated due to the obstruction and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with angioedema likely secondary to ACE inhibitors and is now on the patient's allergy list. There is evidence of persistent opacification at the bases consistent with atelectasis on the chest X-ray, as well as elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The patient's QTc interval on EKG is prolonged at 487 milliseconds. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for a brief episode of decreased oxygen saturation, tachypnea, and distress motioning that he could not breathe, which resolved with increased sedation. The patient's family history includes a sister with the same condition. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on 10/29/2203 at 05:00 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation, is necessary.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of chronic aspiration puts him at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia. The chest X-ray shows some persistent opacification at the bases consistent with atelectasis, which may indicate"

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient presented with acute respiratory failure, anaphylaxis, and pneumonia.
- The patient was extubated this morning and is hemodynamically stable.
- No dyspnea, pain, or itching was observed.
- The patient's allergies include lisinopril and wheezing.
- The patient received various antibiotics and other medications such as furosemide, fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, and heparin sodium.
- The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remained unchanged except for the noted events.
- The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/56 mmHg to 168/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient's respiratory support included CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 579 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- The patient's blood gases indicated a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, PaO2 of 232, respiratory rate of 9.1 L/min, and oxygen consumption of 108 mEq/L.
- Physical examination revealed no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, no stridor, normal cardiovascular findings, bibasilar crackles in the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and no neurologic deficits.
- Laboratory results showed normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. Liver function tests were within normal range.
- The patient's white blood cell count was slightly elevated.
- The assessment included respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, history of alcohol abuse, anaphylaxis, and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The plan included tapering steroids, initiating glycemic control, providing nutrition orally, using stress ulcer prophylaxis, and transferring the patient to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's history of acute respiratory failure and current use of CPAP/PSV mode suggest a risk for VAP. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased leukocyte count, worsening oxygenation, and new infiltrates on chest X-ray would be important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Signs of DVT include unilateral leg swelling, pain, warmth"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, hypertension, and recent addition of ACE inhibitor to BP medications. He presented with acute airway obstruction and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been extubated and doing well. He has a history of alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS) - The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to acute airway obstruction. Although he has been extubated and is doing well, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if his condition worsens.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity - The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to chronic aspiration pneumonia. This can increase the risk of infections and delayed wound healing.
3. Angioedema - The patient experienced angioedema likely caused by ACE inhibitors. This is a known side effect of ACE inhibitors and can cause swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, or intestines. It is important to monitor for any signs of angioedema, especially if the patient is re-exposed to ACE inhibitors.
4. Chronic Aspiration Pneumonia - The patient has a history of chronic aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to recurrent lung infections and respiratory complications.
5. Hypertension - The patient's hypertension is not well controlled, as indicated by the use of ACE inhibitors and verapamil. It is important to manage the patient's blood pressure to"
