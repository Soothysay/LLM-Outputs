   infections, now with bacteremia and acute bacterial cystitis
   24 Hour Events:
 BLOOD CULTURED - At [**2136-6-8**] 12:00 PM -[**6-22**] blood cultures positive
   for GPC's in clusters, so IR removed her tunneled line, and per renal
   recs she will be on a line holiday until Monday.  Therefore she is on
   fluid restriction.
 ULTRASOUND - At [**2136-6-8**] 01:15 PM
   RU chest wall u/s to r/o infection around tunneled HD line, -Ultrasound
   of line site without abscess
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2136-6-8**] 01:45 PM-TTE came back with no
   vegetations, but renal would like a TEE to formerly rule this out.  As
   she is adequately covered on vanc, we can wait on this and re-address
   in AM.
 DIALYSIS CATHETER - STOP [**2136-6-8**] 02:15 PM
   -Urine cultures are growing E. coli, left on cefepime, we can narrow
   this as sensitivities come back.
   -Wound care consulted, and discussed recs with nursing

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and multiple line infections. She is currently experiencing bacteremia and acute bacterial cystitis. The patient has a positive blood culture for GPCs in clusters, speciating with coag + staph aureus, indicating a possible staph aureus bacteremia. She also has an E. coli infection in her urine, with sensitivities pending. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature (Tmax: 37.9°C), tachycardia (HR: 110 bpm), low blood pressure (BP: 97/65 mmHg), and normal respiratory rate (RR: 20 breaths/min). Her oxygen saturation is within normal range (SpO2: 97%). 

Her laboratory results indicate anemia (Hct: 39.7%), elevated white blood cell count (WBC: 13.1 K/uL), normal platelet count (Plt: 516), elevated creatinine (Cr: 3.5), and normal glucose levels (Glucose: 96 mg/dL). Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are also provided.

Imaging studies show no abscess or fluid collection around the hemodialysis catheter. An echocardiogram revealed no vegetations. Microbiology results indicate positive"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and a history of recurrent line infections. She presents with fever, decreased appetite, right flank pain, and chills during hemodialysis. The patient has an allergy to penicillins and received cefepime. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a temperature of 101.8°F. She is on prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications. Her blood culture was obtained, and she underwent an ultrasound of the chest wall to rule out infection around the tunneled hemodialysis line. A trans thoracic echo was also performed, and the dialysis catheter was stopped. Her allergies include penicillins, causing rash and shortness of breath. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the symptoms mentioned above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension - possible sources of infection include the line, subcutaneous emphysema (SBE), and urinary tract infection (UTI).
2. Abdominal pain/flank pain - CT urogram unrevealing, possibly due to constipation, UTI, or other causes.
3. Leg ulcers - possible infection, may require anaerobic coverage.
4. Chronic renal failure on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple prior line infections. She presents with fever, flank pain, decreased appetite, and chills while undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Her blood cultures show growth of gram-positive cocci (GPC) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/65 mmHg to 134/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals obesity, mild diffuse abdominal tenderness, warm skin, pitting edema, and intact neurologic function. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and blood glucose levels, as well as low potassium and magnesium levels. Other notable findings include a history of chronic leg ulcers, recent urinary tract infection with E. coli, and ongoing treatment with antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 97/65 mmHg to 134/113 mmHg. Given the presence of seps"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), history of recurrent line infections, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple prior line infections. She presents with fever, flank pain, decreased appetite, and chills during HD. The patient has been diagnosed with E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), coagulasive-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia, and abdominal pain. Her HD line has been removed, and she is on vancomycin and cefepime antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could indicate hypotension. This may be related to the E. coli UTI and sepsis.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has high bicarbonate levels, indicating metabolic alkalosis. This could be due to chronic renal failure and fluid retention.
3. Diastolic CHF: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF and is being closely monitored for any signs of worsening heart failure.
4. DM: The patient has poorly controlled DM, which can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.
5. Leg ulcers: The patient has chronic leg ulcers, which can be a source of infection and pose a risk for further complications.
6. DVT: The patient has a"
