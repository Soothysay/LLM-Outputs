   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6616**] is a 75 year old female with metastatic colon cancer
   admitted from oncology clinic with dyspnea and hypoxia.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Stable overnight on BiPaP. Likely from worsening metastatic
   parenchymal lung disease, right lower lobe collapse secondary to
   effusion.  Less likely to be related to erbitux or malignant
   pericardial effusion.
   - Wean BiPaP as tolerated
   - Hold off on H2B, benadryl, and hydrocort for now.
   - Hold off on antimicrobials. If patient spikes or becomes
   hemodynamically stable would consider adding broad spectrum
   antibiotics.
   - Discuss with IP regarding diagnostic paracentesis versus pleurex
   catheter placement.
   # Arrythmia: Precipitating event likely tachypnea and hypoxia now
   resolved after NIV initiation.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider TTE in AM to assess LV function and for pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # CV: Increase in TnT to 0.41 with 8% MBI. BNP also mildly elevated to
   700 suggesting element of failure although patient does not appear
   markedly volume overloaded on exam.  Per discussion with cardiology
   while patient in ED, patient heparinized overnight.  Cardiac biomarker
   increase likely represents demand ischemia in setting of afib with RVR
   and transient hypotension.  Given comorbodities most importantly
   metastatic colon CA, plan for conservative medical management at this
   time.
   - Rule out ACS with serial cardiac biomarkers and repeat ECG
   - Hold heparin gtt, convert to heparin SQ.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily. Hold atenolol and [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Check lipid panel, start simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - As above, consider surface echocardiogram
   - Goal TBB -500 to even today.
   .
   # BP: Patient with BP trending down in ED. Per patient and daughter,
   SBP usually in 100s during periods when she is receiving chemotherapy.
   - Hold atenolol, [**Last Name (un) **], and HCTZ.
   .
   # Colon CA: Patient with extensive mets on palliative chemotherapy.
   Discuss with patient long-term goals of care.
   - Discuss with primary oncologist
   - Restart coumadin for portacath after thoracentesis.

   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine.

Mrs. [Known Lastname 6616], a 75-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer, was admitted to the ICU from the oncology clinic with dyspnea and hypoxia. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and has an indwelling port (Portacath). Her vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/75 to 107/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is receiving heparin sodium at a rate of 1,100 units/hour and other ICU medications. The patient has a history of allergies to Neurontin (oral) and wheezing. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dyspnea. The patient's medical and family history remain the same. 

Physical examination reveals that she is on BiPAP, with percussion dullness at the right base. Her lungs are rhonchorous bilaterally. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. 

Laboratory results show white blood cell count of 6.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, glucose level of 126 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.47, and other"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6616**] is a 75 year old female with metastatic colon cancer
   admitted from oncology clinic with dyspnea and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/dyspnea:  Was initially on BiPaP but
   dyspnea improved after right thoracentesis with removal of one liter
   serosanguinous fluid.  Effusion likely represents malignant pleural
   effusion and though patient improved after thoracentesis, short term
   prognosis is poor given extensive pulmonary metastatic disease.
   Unlikely that her oxygen requirement will ever improve significantly or
   that patient will benefit from additional chemotherapy.  Would be
   reasonable to consider hospice options versus high-risk chemotherapy.
   - continue supplemental oxygen
   - CXR in a.m. to assess for reaccumulation of effusion
   - follow up thoracentesis studies, cytology, cultures
   - touch base with IP regarding possible pleurex catheter placement
   - oncology consult regarding long term expectations, goals of care
   # Cardiovascular:  On admission, increase in TnT to 0.41 with 8% MBI.
   BNP also mildly elevated to 700 suggesting element of failure although
   patient does not appear markedly volume overloaded on exam.  Per
   discussion with cardiology while patient in ED, patient heparinized
   overnight.  Cardiac biomarker increase likely represents demand
   ischemia in setting of afib with RVR and transient hypotension.  Given
   comorbodities most importantly metastatic colon CA, plan for
   conservative medical management at this time.  Went into afib with AVR
   overnight on [**6-1**] with subsequent possible enzyme leak.
   - Rule out ACS with serial cardiac biomarkers and repeat ECG though
   likely represents demand ischemia
   - Hold heparin gtt, cont to heparin SQ.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily.
   - metoprolol for blood pressure control
   - cont simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - consider surface echocardiogram
   - Goal TBB -500 to even today.
   # Colon CA: Patient with extensive mets on palliative chemotherapy.
   Discuss with patient long-term goals of care.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] saw patient on
   [**2136-6-1**] in the MICU.
   - f/u oncology reccs
   - Restart coumadin for portacath now that thoracentesis is complete
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Iron deficiency anemia: Hct at baseline.
   - Trend hct.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6616**] is a 75 year old female with metastatic colon cancer
   admitted from oncology clinic with dyspnea and hypoxia.
   # Dyspnea: Stable overnight on BiPaP. Likely from worsening metastatic
   parenchymal lung disease, right lower lobe collapse secondary to
   effusion.  Less likely to be related to erbitux or malignant
   pericardial effusion.
   - Wean BiPaP as tolerated
   - Hold off on H2B, benadryl, and hydrocort for now.
   - Hold off on antimicrobials. If patient spikes or becomes
   hemodynamically stable would consider adding broad spectrum
   antibiotics.
   - Discuss with IP regarding diagnostic paracentesis versus pleurex
   catheter placement.
   # Arrythmia: Precipitating event likely tachypnea and hypoxia now
   resolved after NIV initiation.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Consider TTE in AM to assess LV function and for pericardial
   effusion.
   # CV: Increase in TnT to 0.41 with 8% MBI. BNP also mildly elevated to
   700 suggesting element of failure although patient does not appear
   markedly volume overloaded on exam.  Per discussion with cardiology
   while patient in ED, patient heparinized overnight.  Cardiac biomarker

   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily. Hold atenolol and [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Check lipid panel, start simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - As above, consider surface echocardiogram
   - Goal TBB -500 to even today.
   # BP: Patient with BP trending down in ED. Per patient and daughter,
   SBP usually in 100s during periods when she is receiving chemotherapy.
   - Hold atenolol, [**Last Name (un) **], and HCTZ.

From the 24-hour events section, it is mentioned that the patient underwent a diagnostic/therapeutic procedure where 1 L of serosanguinous fluid was removed and resulted in subjective improvement in breathing. After the procedure, the patient was able to go off bipap and stay on face mask with good ABG results.

The patient received several boluses of ativan due to anxiety and had a run of SVT with a heart rate of 168 bpm overnight, but was asymptomatic. A follow-up EKG showed TWIs in inferior leads and anteriolateral leads, so coronary event evaluators were requested.

The patient's allergies include Neurontin (Oral) (Gabapentin) and wheezing. The last dose of antibiotics was not mentioned.

Regarding medications, the patient was started on metoprolol, lorazepam (Ativan), and restarted warfarin for port thrombosis prophylaxis. Other medications include infusions and ICU medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6616**] is a 75 year old female with metastatic colon cancer
   admitted from oncology clinic with dyspnea and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/dyspnea: Successfully weaned off BiPaP
   after therapeutic thoracentesis that was exudative with cytology
   pending.  Likely represents malignant pleural effusion. WOB and O2
   requirement increasing overnight.
   - Discuss with IP regarding pleurex catheter placement.
   - Follow-up pleural fluid cytology
   - Monitor respiratory status, place back on BiPap if necessary. If
   patient requires intubation, she would be difficult to extubate
   successfully
   # Cardiovascular:  On admission, increase in TnT to 0.41 with 8% MBI.
   BNP also mildly elevated to 700 suggesting element of failure although
   patient does not appear markedly volume overloaded on exam.  Per
   discussion with cardiology while patient in ED, patient heparinized
   initially.  Cardiac biomarker increase likely represents demand
   ischemia in setting of afib with RVR and transient hypotension.  Given
   comorbodities most importantly metastatic colon CA, plan for
   conservative medical management at this time and heparin was d/c
d and
   coumadin was restarted.  Went into tachyarrthymia overnight with
   continued cardiac biomarker leak.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily.
   - Metoprolol for BP and rate control
   - Continue simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - Consider surface echocardiogram
   - Goal TBB -500 to even today.
   # Colon CA: Patient with extensive mets on palliative chemotherapy.
   Discuss with patient long-term goals of care.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] saw patient on
   [**2136-6-1**] in the MICU.
   - F/u oncology recs
   - Restart coumadin for portacath now that thoracentesis is complete
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care.
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Iron deficiency anemia: Hct at baseline.
   - Trend hct.
   FEN: Regular
   PPx: Heparin SQ until INR therapeutic
   Access: PIV, Portacath
   Code: DNR, ok to intubate. No CVL (confirmed with patient)
   Dispo: ICU level of care.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6616**] is a 75 year old female with metastatic colon cancer
   admitted from oncology clinic with dyspnea and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/dyspnea: Increased WOB, resp distress,
   and O2 requirement today now back on BiPaP.  CXR demonstrates
   reaccumulation of pleural effusion.  Fluid exudative with cytology
   pending, although likely malignant in etiology.
   - Will d/w IP tomorrow re pleurex catheter placement
   - Wean NIV as tolerated.
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care.
   # Cardiovascular:  On admission, increase in TnT to 0.41 with 8% MBI.
   BNP also mildly elevated to 700 suggesting element of failure although
   patient does not appear markedly volume overloaded on exam.  Per
   discussion with cardiology while patient in ED, patient heparinized
   initially.  Cardiac biomarker increase likely represents demand
   ischemia in setting of afib with RVR and transient hypotension.  Given
   comorbodities most importantly metastatic colon CA, plan for
   conservative medical management at this time and heparin was d/c
d and
   coumadin was restarted.  Went into tachyarrthymia overnight with
   continued cardiac biomarker leak.
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily.
   - Metoprolol for BP and rate control
   - Continue simvastatin 80 mg daily
   - Consider TTE to assess for structural pathology regarding
   narrow-complex SVT.
   - Goal TBB -500 to even today.
   # Colon CA: Patient with extensive mets on palliative chemotherapy.
   Discuss with patient long-term goals of care.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] saw patient on

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and hypoxia. She has been experiencing increased work of breathing and respiratory distress, requiring bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). A chest X-ray shows reaccumulation of pleural effusion, which is likely due to malignant causes. The plan is to discuss the placement of a pleurex catheter with interventional pulmonology tomorrow and wean off noninvasive ventilation as tolerated.

The patient also has cardiovascular issues, including an increase in cardiac biomarkers (TnT) and BNP, indicating possible heart failure. She was initially heparinized due to cardiac concerns but has since been discharged from heparin and restarted on coumadin. The patient experienced tachyarrhythmias overnight, along with continued cardiac biomarker leakage. The plan includes continuing aspirin, metoprolol for rate control, simvastatin, and considering a transthoracic echocardiogram to assess for structural pathology.

The patient has metastatic colon cancer and is on palliative chemotherapy. Long-term goals of care should be discussed with the patient. She is also being treated for hypothyroidism and iron deficiency anemia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is being provided with ICU level of care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical issues. The patient's chief complaint is not clearly stated in the note. 

The patient experienced episodes of tachycardia, with one episode lasting up to 200 beats per minute (SVT) and was successfully slowed down to 120 beats per minute using a vagal maneuver. The EKG findings suggest a possible atrial fibrillation but rate control was achieved with metoprolol and IV fluids.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as indicated by an increased work of breathing (WOB) and an ABG result showing pH 7.42, PaCO2 40 mmHg, PaO2 58 mmHg, and SaO2 93%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for oxygen delivery.

The patient has a history of allergies to Neurontin (Gabapentin) and wheezing. There is no mention of any antibiotic use in the recent past.

The patient is on several medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, metoprolol, and diltiazem. Other medications are also being administered.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.5 C (97.7 F), a current temperature of 35.3 C (95.6 F), a heart rate of 96 bpm with a range of 90-220 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, metastatic colon cancer, and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient's medical history includes myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypotension, tachycardia, a history of malignant neoplasm (colon cancer), and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV with 100% FiO2 and showing signs of diaphoresis and increased work of breathing (WOB).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial damage. This condition requires ongoing monitoring and management.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib RVR), which has since resolved with treatment of respiratory failure, afib RVR, and hypoxemia.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has a narrow-complex SVT that is asymptomatic and breaks easily with spontaneous activity, carotid sinus massage, or diltiazem administration.
4. History of Malignant Neoplasm (Colon Cancer): The patient has a history of metastatic colon cancer and is currently receiving palliative treatment with erbitux.
5. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially able to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6616**] is a 75 year old female with metastatic colon cancer
   admitted from oncology clinic with dyspnea and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/dyspnea: Increased WOB, resp distress,
   and O2 requirement today now back on BiPaP.  CXR demonstrates
   reaccumulation of pleural effusion.  Fluid exudative with cytology
   pending, although likely malignant in etiology.  Back on BIPAP on [**6-3**]
   because of increased work of breathing.  [**Month (only) 8**] benefit from pleurex
   catheter but overall respiratory status severely compromised by
   extensive lung metastases.
   - family meeting regarding expectations, goals of care
   - consider IP consult for pleurex pending family meeting
   # Cardiovascular:  On admission, increase in TnT to 0.41 with 8% MBI.
   BNP also mildly elevated to 700 suggesting element of failure although
   patient does not appear markedly volume overloaded on exam.  Per
   discussion with cardiology while patient in ED, patient heparinized
   initially.  Cardiac biomarker increase likely represents demand
   ischemia in setting of afib with RVR and transient hypotension.  Given
   comorbodities most importantly metastatic colon CA, plan for
   conservative medical management at this time and heparin was d/c
d and
   coumadin was restarted.  Now has runs of tachyarrthymia, question
   re-entrant tachycardia, and not responding to diltiazem or metoprolol
   IV.  Concerning giving risk of demand ischemia and unstable arrythmia.
   ECHO shows LVEF 20%, RV hypokinesis.
   - optimize respiratory status
   - consider adenosine for diagnostic purposes
   - Metoprolol for BP and rate control
   - f/u final ECHO read
   - Continue ASA 325 mg daily.
   - Continue simvastatin 80 mg daily
   # Colon CA: Patient with extensive mets on palliative chemotherapy.
   Discuss with patient long-term goals of care.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] saw patient on
   [**2136-6-3**] in the MICU, raised possibility of pleurex catheter but
   unlikely to benefit long-term given extensive lung metastatic disese.
   - F/u oncology recs
   - Holding coumadin for portacath now given possibility of repeat
   thoracentesis
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care.
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Iron deficiency anemia: Hct at baseline.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, including an increase in troponin levels and a mildly elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), suggesting possible cardiac failure. The patient's respiratory status is severely compromised due to extensive lung metastases, and there is a reaccumulation of pleural effusion. The patient's work of breathing (WOB) is increased, and she is currently on BiPAP support. 

The patient has been experiencing runs of tachyarrhythmias, which are not responding to diltiazem or metoprolol IV. An echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and right ventricular hypokinesis. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate need to be controlled, and further evaluation with adenosine is recommended for diagnostic purposes. 

The patient's long-term goals of care should be discussed with the oncology team, as she is on palliative chemotherapy for her extensive metastatic disease. A family meeting has been scheduled to discuss the patient's code status, which is currently set to full code. The patient's iron deficiency anemia and hypothyroidism should be monitored and managed accordingly."

","Based on the provided progress note, Mrs. [**Known lastname 6616**] is a 75-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer admitted to the ICU from the oncology clinic with dyspnea and hypoxia. 

The patient's medical history includes a history of colon cancer with metastasis, hypothyroidism, iron deficiency anemia, and previous cardiac issues. She is currently on multiple medications including metoprolol, diltiazem, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and levothyroxine. 

On admission, the patient experienced tachycardia with a heart rate of 200 beats per minute, which was slowed down using vagal maneuvers. She also had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating between 108/60 mmHg and 122/77 mmHg. 

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with increased work of breathing and the need for BiPAP support. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2 of 80 mmHg. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. The troponin T level is within normal range, and the lactic acid level is slightly elevated."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6616**] is a 75 year old female with metastatic colon cancer
   admitted from oncology clinic with dyspnea and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/dyspnea: Increased WOB, resp distress,
   and hypoxia  with continued BiPaP requirement.  CXR demonstrates
   reaccumulation of pleural effusion.  Fluid exudative with cytology
   pending, and likely malignant in etiology.
   Unclear if patient would benefit from pigtail or pleurex catheter
   placement as patient had minimal symptomatic improvement during
   therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) **] during admission. Family meeting yesterday with
   decision to defer further interventions and for patient to likely move
   towards comfort care today.
   - Continue BiPaP
   - Morphine and benzos prn for comfort and air hunger
   - Family meeting to readdress goals of care today
   - Chaplain and palliative care c/s.
   - Discuss with primary oncologist ([**Doctor Last Name 4297**])
   # Cardiovascular:  On admission, increase in TnT to 0.41 with 8% MBI.
   BNP also mildly elevated to 700 suggesting of failure although patient
   does not appear markedly volume overloaded on exam.  Repeat TTE
   yesterday with marked [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular failure.  Patient with
   intermittent SVT of unclear etiology up to 220s with some improvement
   with diltiazem and metoprolol. SVT likely secondary to worsening
   pulmonary function.
   - Optimize respiratory status
   - Continue metoprolol PO TiD. IV AV nodal blockade as necessary
   - Continue ASA 325
   - Continue simvastatin 80 mg daily
   # Colon CA: Patient with extensive mets on palliative chemotherapy.
   Discuss with patient long-term goals of care.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] saw patient on
   [**2136-6-3**] in the MICU, raised possibility of pleurex catheter but
   unlikely to benefit long-term given extensive lung metastatic disese.
   - F/u oncology recs
   - Holding coumadin for portacath for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 75-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer admitted for dyspnea and hypoxia.
- The patient continues to have runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which responded to diltiazem and metoprolol.
- The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing hypoxia, respiratory distress, and the need for continuous positive airway pressure (BiPaP).
- The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, but heart rate is elevated.
- The patient's oxygen saturation is consistently above 99%.
- The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, iron deficiency anemia, and colon cancer with extensive metastases.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function.
- The patient's chest X-ray demonstrates reaccumulation of pleural effusion, which is likely exudative and possibly malignant in etiology.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes (TropT) are within normal limits, indicating no active cardiac damage.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.
- The patient's goals of care have been discussed with the family, and a decision has been made to move towards comfort care rather than further aggressive interventions.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate).
- The patient's nutritional, glycemic control, and medication management plans are mentioned, along with the need for regular monitoring and treatment for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include worsening respiratory failure, further episodes of SVT, development of DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and hypoxia. She is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure with increased work of breathing, respiratory distress, and the need for continuous BiPAP support. A chest X-ray shows reaccumulation of a pleural effusion, which is likely due to malignant causes. The patient has had minimal improvement with therapeutic paracentesis during her admission. The family has decided to defer further interventions and move towards comfort care.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and dependence on BiPAP indicate a severe impairment in gas exchange and oxygenation.
2. Pleural effusion: The reaccumulation of the pleural effusion suggests ongoing fluid accumulation in the lungs, which may further compromise respiratory function.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's elevated troponin levels and B-type natriuretic peptide suggest cardiac involvement, potentially related to pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular failure.
4. Intermittent SVT (supraventricular tachycardia): The patient's episodes of rapid heart rate require close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as hemodynamic instability or arrhythmia progression.
5. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate a need for further investigation and management to address possible causes of anemia, such as chronic blood loss or nutritional deficiencies.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 6616**] is a 75 year old female with metastatic colon cancer
   admitted from oncology clinic with dyspnea and hypoxia.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure/dyspnea: Increased WOB, resp distress,
   and hypoxia  with continued BiPaP requirement.  CXR demonstrates
   reaccumulation of pleural effusion.  Fluid exudative with cytology
   pending, and likely malignant in etiology.
   Unclear if patient would benefit from pigtail or pleurex catheter
   placement as patient had minimal symptomatic improvement during
   therapeutic [**Female First Name (un) **] during admission. Family meeting yesterday with
   decision to defer further interventions and for patient to likely move
   towards comfort care today.
   - Continue BiPaP
   - Morphine and benzos prn for comfort and air hunger
   - Family meeting to readdress goals of care today
   - Chaplain and palliative care c/s.
   - Discuss with primary oncologist ([**Doctor Last Name 4297**])
   # Cardiovascular:  On admission, increase in TnT to 0.41 with 8% MBI.
   BNP also mildly elevated to 700 suggesting of failure although patient
   does not appear markedly volume overloaded on exam.  Repeat TTE
   yesterday with marked [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular failure.  Patient with
   intermittent SVT of unclear etiology up to 220s with some improvement
   with diltiazem and metoprolol. SVT likely secondary to worsening
   pulmonary function.
   - Optimize respiratory status
   - Continue metoprolol PO TiD. IV AV nodal blockade as necessary
   - Continue ASA 325
   - Continue simvastatin 80 mg daily
   # Colon CA: Patient with extensive mets on palliative chemotherapy.
   Discuss with patient long-term goals of care.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4297**] saw patient on
   [**2136-6-3**] in the MICU, raised possibility of pleurex catheter but
   unlikely to benefit long-term given extensive lung metastatic disese.
   - F/u oncology recs
   - Holding coumadin for portacath for now.
   - Family meeting to discuss goals of care as above.
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine.
   # Iron deficiency anemia: Hct at baseline.
   - Trend hct.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer who was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea and hypoxia. She is currently on BiPAP for respiratory support and has been experiencing increased work of breathing, respiratory distress, and hypoxia. A chest X-ray shows reaccumulation of pleural effusion, which is likely malignant in origin. The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with elevated troponin levels and signs of heart failure. She has been experiencing intermittent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which may be related to worsening pulmonary function. The patient's family has decided to move towards comfort care, and interventions such as pigtail or PleurX catheter placement have been deferred. The patient's code status remains DNR/DNI, and a family meeting will be held to discuss goals of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing need for BiPAP and the presence of hypoxia indicate a potential risk for worsening respiratory failure.
2. Malignant pleural effusion: The reaccumulation of pleural effusion, likely due to metastatic cancer, can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential infection.
3. Cardiac failure: The elevated troponin levels and B-type natriuretic peptide suggest cardiac dysfunction, which may progress to worsening heart failure.
4. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT"

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing runs of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which were treated with diltiazem and metoprolol. The patient's code status is full code. The patient is on BiPAP support almost the entire night and receiving morphine prn boluses for air hunger. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing runs of SVT, which could potentially lead to complications such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
2. Abdominal compartment syndrome/intra-abdominal hypertension (ACS/IAH): The patient has a history of abdominal compartment syndrome, which can cause increased intra-abdominal pressure leading to organ dysfunction.
3. Anxiety: The patient is showing signs of anxiety, which can be managed with appropriate medication but may also contribute to increased heart rate and blood pressure.
4. Myocardial infarction (heart attack): The patient's history of cancer and the current symptoms could increase the risk of myocardial infarction.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are on the lower side, indicating hypotension. It is important to closely monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure to prevent complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient's code status has been changed to comfort measures only. The patient is receiving morphine sulfate and diazepam for pain and comfort. BiPAP is used as needed for comfort. The patient has lung metastases and recurrent pleural effusion contributing to hypoxic respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory distress and hypoxia due to lung metastases and recurrent pleural effusion may worsen without intervention.
2. Metastatic colon cancer progression: The patient's underlying metastatic colon cancer may continue to progress, potentially leading to further complications and deterioration of the patient's overall health.
3. Respiratory infections: The patient's compromised respiratory function increases the risk of developing respiratory infections, such as pneumonia, which can further compromise respiratory function and overall health.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating a potential risk for cardiovascular instability. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
5. Sedation and medication side effects: The use of morphine sulfate and diazepam for comfort measures may lead to sedation and respiratory depression. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is essential to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer admitted to the ICU from the oncology clinic due to dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient has been transitioned to comfort measures only. Vital signs include a heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/60 mmHg to 119/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient is on non-rebreather oxygen, CPAP/PSV ventilation, and receiving morphine sulfate and diazepam for comfort. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and elevated creatinine and lactate levels. The patient's condition is complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure/dyspnea due to lung metastases and recurrent pleural effusion. The patient's code status is comfort measures only, and all other medications except for morphine and diazepam have been held.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications for this patient include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and increased work of breathing indicate ongoing respiratory distress. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and potential cardiovascular collapse.

2. Recurrent pleural effusion: The presence of recurrent pleural effusion suggests ongoing fluid accumulation in the lungs. If not managed appropriately, this can wors"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with metastatic colon cancer admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and hypoxia. She is now on comfort measures only after a palliative care meeting with her primary care physician. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. She is receiving morphine and diazepam for symptom management and is on non-invasive ventilation with a non-rebreather mask. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. Her laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and recurrent pleural effusion may increase the risk of pneumonia due to decreased oxygenation and potential aspiration.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and cancer can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which could potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism if they travel to the lungs.
3. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The use of high-dose opioids like morphine can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to decreased gastric mucosal protection.
4. Ventilator-associated Pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia.
5. Hypercapnia: The patient's increased work of breathing and respiratory distress may lead to increased carbon"
