","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He underwent right total hip arthroplasty but developed post-operative bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) dropped significantly overnight from 34.5% to 26.4% and then to 21.4%. He is currently receiving a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The attending orthopedic surgeon requested central venous access for central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. The patient has allergies to lisinopril and aspirin, and he is currently on various ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's Hct levels indicate a significant drop, which suggests acute blood loss anemia. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness. The patient is receiving a blood transfusion to address this condition.

2. Infection: The patient has a history of prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy and gastrointestinal bleeding. These conditions increase the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or worsening pain at the surgical site, is important.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized due to the surgery, there is an increased risk of"

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and osteoarthritis who underwent right total hip arthroplasty (THA) complicated by post-operative bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has shown a significant drop overnight from 34.5 to 26.4 to 21.4, indicating acute blood loss anemia, likely secondary to surgical bleeding. The patient is currently receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Significant re-bleeding: Transfusing less than 24% of the total blood volume may suggest significant re-bleeding.
2. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and surgery.
3. Infection: The patient is on peri-operative prophylactic antibiotics, but there is still a risk of surgical site infection.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can be attributed to the acute blood loss and ongoing bleeding.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient is on respiratory support with a face tent, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Due to hypotension and potential hypoperfusion to the kidneys.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He underwent right total hip arthroplasty but experienced post-operative bleeding. The patient has been hemodynamically stable but has shown a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) overnight, from 34.5 to 26.4 to 21.4. He is currently receiving a blood transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Orthopedic attending requested central venous line (CVL) for central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's Hct levels have decreased significantly, indicating acute blood loss likely due to surgical bleeding. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and weakness.
2. Re-bleeding: Transfusion of PRBCs is being administered to the patient. If the patient experiences further bleeding, it could result in worsening anemia and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Osteoarthritis post total hip arthroplasty (THA): The patient had THA surgery, which can lead to post-operative pain. Proper pain management is essential to prevent complications like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Diabetes mellitus type "

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man who underwent a total hip arthroplasty and experienced significant intraoperative blood loss, requiring 3 liters of lactated Ringer's solution and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). His preoperative hemoglobin concentration was 34.5%, which decreased to 24% in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). He has been hemodynamically stable without episodes of hypotension. However, his hematocrit levels continue to drop, from 26.4% to 21.4%. The patient's vitals are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/53 to 134/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals pale conjunctiva and distant heart sounds. The patient has limited movement in his extremities and has not been assessed for muscle tone or neurological status. His pain level is moderate, ranging from 6-16 on a scale of 1-10.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient's low hematocrit levels indicate ongoing bleeding or inadequate replacement of lost blood volume. This can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: Prolonged use of"

   Imaging: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-26**]:
   New right internal jugular central venous line ends at the superior
   cavoatrial junction. Mild widening of the mediastinum to the right of
   the midline is probably venous engorgement since there is no
   contralateral displacement of
   the trachea to suggest a hematoma. Heart size is mildly enlarged and
   unchanged. Mild interstitial edema which was present on [**5-26**] has
   resolved and there is no appreciable pleural effusion. Thoracic aorta
   is generally large and tortuous but not focally dilated.
   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old man with DM2, HTN, osteoartitis s/p right THA complicated
   post-op bleeding.
    # Acute blood loss anemia: Secondary to surgical bleeding. No stool
   output yet to suggest GI source. Hct trend over 24 hours is
   21.4->22.8->24.6->24.2->24 this morning. Patient has rec
d a total of 6
   units prbcs over 24 hours and is currently receiving 2 more units
   PRBCs.  Orthopedics aware this morning.
   - Post-tx Hct and cycle q6
   - Transfuse for <24% as this would likely suggest significant
   re-bleeding
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Continue to monitor thigh diameter
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of compartment syndrome (ie pain
   out of proportion to exam)
   - Awaiting post-tx Hct to determine if futher imaging such as CT should
   be done to rule out other areas of bleed (such as RP)
   - IVF/blood prn volume; patient appears dry on exam
   - As it is still not entirely clear if patient is bleeding anywhere
   other than his thigh, will check bladder pressure to monitor abdominal
   pressures as a measure to follow along with thigh diameter (which has
   been stable).
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely in the setting of 6 units prbcs without
   platelets.
   - Will continue to monitor pm CBC, if platelets lower, will consider
   platelet tx at that time
   # Osteoarthritis s/p THA: now POD#1 from surgery.
   - Pain control with tylenol, oxycodone and dilaudid being careful to
   avoid sedation/somnolence
   - Ortho recs
   - Hold LMWH for now in the setting of bleed, will discuss
   anticoagulation with ortho once Hct stabilized
   - Monitor peripheral pulses
   - PT consult requested for POD 2 or 3 once acute issues resolved
   # DM2: Adequate control for now.
   - Hold oral meds for now (metformin, actos, glipizide)
   - RISS
   # Hypertension: hold anti-hypertensives until Hct stable
   # FEN: Replete lytes prn, IVF as above, PO as tolerated

","The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with complications following right total hip arthroplasty, specifically post-operative bleeding.

The patient received four units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) within 24 hours, resulting in a 1.5-point increase in hematocrit (HCT). However, the HCT did not significantly increase after the second unit, which is expected in cases of significant blood loss. The patient's thigh diameter has been maintained at 23.75 inches. A central venous line (CVL) has been placed.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), current temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate (HR) ranging from 66 to 118 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 109/43 mmHg to 156/69 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%, and sinus rhythm (SR) heart rhythm. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg, fluid intake is 4,421 mL, fluid output is 1,460 mL, urine output is 1,430 mL, and blood product transfusion is 1,478 mL.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.7 g/dL, glucose level of 123 mg/dL, platelet count of 97 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.8 mg/dL, sodium (Na) level of 139 mEq/L, potassium (K) level of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride (Cl) level of 104 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 24.0%, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 13 mg/dL. Imaging shows a new right internal jugular central venous line and mild widening of the mediastinum to the right of midline.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute blood loss anemia due to surgical bleeding, thrombocytopenia likely secondary to 6 units of PRBCs without platelets, osteoarthritis status post right total hip arthroplasty, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and femoral neck fracture.

Potential medical complications that can arise include continued bleeding, infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia, and complications related to diabetes and hypertension."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and prostate cancer who underwent a right total hip arthroplasty. He is now in the ICU due to post-operative bleeding complications. The patient received four units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) overnight, with only a 1.5 pt increase in hematocrit (HCT). A central venous line (CVL) was placed, and the patient's vital signs are stable. His blood glucose level is within an acceptable range. The patient's laboratory values show mild abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated creatinine. An imaging study reveals mild widening of the mediastinum, possibly due to venous engorgement, and an enlarged heart size. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient has experienced significant bleeding post-surgery, leading to a drop in HCT from 34.5 to 21.4. This may result in inadequate oxygenation and tissue perfusion.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding.
3. Renal impairment: Elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which can be exacerbated by hypoperfusion and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient"

   Imaging: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-26**]:
   New right internal jugular central venous line ends at the superior
   cavoatrial junction. Mild widening of the mediastinum to the right of
   the midline is probably venous engorgement since there is no
   contralateral displacement of the trachea to suggest a hematoma. Heart
   size is mildly enlarged and unchanged. Mild interstitial edema which
   was present on [**5-26**] has resolved and there is no appreciable
   pleural effusion. Thoracic aorta is generally large and tortuous but
   not focally dilated.
   Assessment and Plan
   77 year old man with DM2, HTN, osteoartitis s/p right THA complicated
   post-op bleeding.
    # Acute blood loss anemia: Secondary to surgical bleeding. No stool
   output yet to suggest GI source. Hct trend over 24 hours is
   21.4->22.8->24.6->24.2->24 this morning. Patient has rec
d a total of 6
   units prbcs over 24 hours and is currently receiving 2 more units
   PRBCs.  Orthopedics aware this morning.
   - Post-tx Hct and cycle q6
   - Transfuse for <24% as this would likely suggest significant
   re-bleeding
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Continue to monitor thigh diameter, has been stable
   - Will continue to monitor for signs of compartment syndrome (ie pain
   out of proportion to exam)
   - Awaiting post-tx Hct to determine if futher imaging such as CT should
   be done to rule out other areas of bleed (such as RP)
   - IVF/blood prn volume; patient appears dry on exam
   - As it is still not entirely clear if patient is bleeding anywhere
   other than his thigh, will check bladder pressure to monitor abdominal
   pressures as a measure to follow along with thigh diameter
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely in the setting of 6 units prbcs without
   platelets.
   - Will continue to monitor pm CBC, if platelets lower, will consider
   platelet tx at that time
   # Osteoarthritis s/p THA: now POD#1 from surgery.
   - Pain control with tylenol, oxycodone and dilaudid being careful to
   avoid sedation/somnolence
   - Ortho recs
   - Hold LMWH for now in the setting of bleed, will discuss
   anticoagulation with ortho once Hct stabilized
   - Monitor peripheral pulses
   - PT consult requested for POD 2 or 3 once acute issues resolved
   # DM2: Adequate control for now.
   - Hold oral meds for now (metformin, actos, glipizide)
   - RISS
   # Hypertension: hold anti-hypertensives until Hct stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with complications following right total hip arthroplasty, specifically post-operative bleeding. The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the past 24 hours with only a 1.5 pt increase in hematocrit (HCT). His thigh diameter is maintained at 23.75 inches, and he has had a central venous line placed. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.6 F), blood pressure ranging from 141/55 mmHg to 109/43 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 21.4 g/dL, platelet count of 97 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 123 mg/dL. 

Imaging reveals a new right internal jugular central venous line ending at the superior cavoatrial junction, mild widening of the mediastinum, mild interstitial edema, and no appreciable pleural effusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He underwent a right total hip arthroplasty but experienced post-operative bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his hemoglobin (Hct) level increased from 24 to 28.4, which has been stable. Orthopedics recommended holding low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) and watching and waiting (WBAT). 

The patient's bladder pressure decreased from 14 to 6-7 and has remained stable. He has been monitored for signs of compartment syndrome, particularly pain out of proportion to the exam. No further imaging is needed as the Hct level remains stable. The patient is tolerating oral fluids and will continue to receive intravenous fluids and blood products as needed.

The patient also has thrombocytopenia, likely due to the transfusion of 6 units of PRBCs without platelets. His platelet count has improved without transfusion and will continue to be monitored. 

Regarding his osteoarthritis after total hip arthroplasty, the patient is now one day post-surgery. Pain control is being managed with acetaminophen, oxycodone, and dilaudid, while avoiding sedation and somnolence. Orthopedics recommends holding LMWH until the Hct stabilizes and will discuss anticoagulation with ortho. Peripheral pulses should be monitored, and physical therapy is being recommended.

The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 is currently adequately controlled, although oral medications have been held due to the gastrointestinal bleeding. His hypertension is also being managed by holding anti-hypertensives until the Hct stabilizes. 

The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition through a diabetic diet, glycemic control with insulin sliding scale (ISS), and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be communicated with the orthopedics today."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and osteoarthritis who underwent a right total hip arthroplasty (THA) and experienced post-operative bleeding. He received a total of 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission. His hematocrit (Hct) levels have been increasing, currently at 28.5%, and he is stable. The orthopedic team recommended continuing monitoring, including white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet (Plt) counts every 6 hours. They also suggested transfusing for an Hct <24% to indicate significant re-bleeding and to continue monitoring for signs of compartment syndrome. Imaging is not necessary at this time as the Hct is stable. Intravenous fluids (IVF) and blood products will be administered as needed. The patient's bladder pressure is stable and being monitored. Thrombocytopenia has improved without platelet transfusion, so no further action is required at this time. Pain control measures are in place, and the patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension are being managed. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to continue ICU monitoring for now, with a possible consultation later today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He underwent right total hip arthroplasty but developed post-operative bleeding. The patient received a total of 8 units of packed red blood cells since admission. His hematocrit (Hct) levels have improved from 24 to 28.5%. However, the patient is experiencing thrombocytopenia, likely due to the transfusion of blood products without platelets. The orthopedic team recommends monitoring the patient's condition and continuing with wide bore anterior tibial access (WBAT). The patient's bladder pressure has stabilized at 7 mmHg. There are no new imaging results or microbiology findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss anemia: The patient's Hct levels indicate ongoing blood loss or inadequate compensation for the blood loss. Monitoring and continuing to cycle Hct every 6 hours is recommended. Transfusing for <24% Hct may suggest significant re-bleeding, and stool guaiac testing should be done to rule out gastrointestinal bleeding as a source.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has received a significant amount of blood products without platelets, which can lead to decreased platelet count. Continued monitoring of platelet levels is advised, and transfusion of platelets may be necessary if the count continues to"
