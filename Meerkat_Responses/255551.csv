   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a h/o alcoholism c/b DTs/seizures 2 years ago,
   polysubstance abuse including IV heroin, cocaine, crack (last use 2
   years ago), heroin inhalation (last use 2 days ago), hep C, presents
   for voluntary admission for detox.
   .
   # ETOH Withdrawal-given h/o severe DTs/seizures observation in ICU is
   reasonable. Pt requiring more valium however stable overnight.
   Diaphoresis, persistent tachycardia, anxiety, and tremors point to
   insufficiently controlled withdrawl symptoms.
   -Increasing valium from Valium 10mg PO Q2H to Valium 10mg PO Q1H for
   CIWA>10; hold for CIWA<10 or signs of intoxication, low threshold to
   increase dose or switch to IV if pt worsens scores or becomes
   hemodynamically unstable.
   -Continue MVI, Thiamine, Folate
   -Continue Aggressive IVF
   -Replete lytes with close attention to K and Mg
   -SW consult today
   .
   # Ovarian vein thrombosis: Pt at risk given her recent birth and recent
   C-section.
   -F/u  blood cx
   -Continue heparin gtt
   -Continue amp-sulbactam 3gm IV Q6H
   -Obtain MRV today to confirm dx, if negative, would DC abx and heparin.
   If positive, pt would require at least 2 weeks of IV abx and
   anticoagulation.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Elevated Lipase/Pancreatitis and CT abdomen
   consistent with mild pancreatitis with a Ransen score of 3. However,
   her abdominal pain is lower quadrant. She has other potential reasons
   for pain including heroin withdrawl, biliary disease (although per rads
   no e/o biliary disease on CT), and most intriguing ovarian vein
   thrombosis can p/w lower abdominal pain, N/V.  RUQ negative for e/o
   biliary disease, portal vein thrombosis, but did show e/o early
   cirrhosis.
   -IVF
   -Slowly advance diet starting with clears
   -Pain control with morphine 2-4mg IV Q4H PRN for now, will evaluate
   switching to methadone for more long acting pain based on her prior
   doses
   -F/u U/A with cx
   .
   # Acute anemia: Likely secondary to hemodilution given pt was
   significantly dry. Consider worsening pancreatitis. Consider alcoholic
   gastritis.
   -Active type and screen
   -Guiac all stools
   -Recheck HCT at 1700
   -Starting Pantoprazole 40mg PO Daily
   .
   # Acute thrombocytopenia: Again likely secondary to hemodilution.
   Because she was likely dehydrated this admission we are seeing her true
   values which are low. Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to HCV
   cirrhosis.
   -Recheck platelets at 1700, with low threshold to stop heparin
   .
   # Hep C: Unknown extent.
   -Check viral load
   -Obtaining records from [**Hospital1 587**]
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse:
   -SW consult
   -Check HIV for high risk behavior

   # FEN: NPO, IVF, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Confirmed Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: Likely called out to floor tomorrow if stable overnight.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of alcoholism and polysubstance abuse who presents for voluntary admission for detoxification. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, such as diaphoresis, persistent tachycardia, anxiety, and tremors. She is being managed with diazepam (Valium) every 1 hour based on her CIWA score.

2. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient's CT abdomen with contrast shows mild peripancreatic stranding in the region of the pancreatic head, suggesting mild acute pancreatitis. Her elevated lipase levels also support this diagnosis.

3. Ovarian Vein Thrombosis: The patient has a potential diagnosis of ovarian vein thrombosis, which can present with lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Further imaging, such as an MRV, is planned to confirm the diagnosis.

4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia, likely secondary to hemodilution or worsening pancreatitis. Rechecking the hematocrit (HCT) at 1700 is recommended.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which may be due to hemodilution or chronic thrombocytopenia secondary to HCV cirrhosis. Rechecking platelets at"

","Summary:
The patient is a voluntary admission for detoxification with a history of chronic viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, acute pancreatitis, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity. The patient received diazepam and morphine overnight for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. They are currently on heparin sodium infusion and have been monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient may be at risk for seizures due to alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens).
2. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system from chronic viral hepatitis and pancreatitis, there is a risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated levels of lactic acid and creatinine indicate possible renal impairment, which could worsen if not properly managed.
4. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PT/INR suggests an increased risk of bleeding, especially considering they are on heparin sodium infusion.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of DVT and ongoing immobilization in the ICU may increase the risk of further thromboembolic events.
6. Pancreatitis complications: The patient's mild acute pancreatitis could progress to more severe forms, leading to complications like pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts.
7. Hepatitis flare-up: The patient's chronic viral hepatitis could potentially flare up during alcohol withdrawal, leading to hepatic dysfunction."

","The patient is a 45-year-old male who voluntarily admitted himself to the ICU for detoxification. He has a history of chronic viral hepatitis and alcohol abuse. The patient presented with symptoms of acute pancreatitis and a potential deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower extremity. He was given diazepam and morphine overnight. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112 to 133 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient appears well-nourished and overweight but shows signs of anxiety and diaphoresis. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems. There is no evidence of peripheral edema or cyanosis. Neurological examination shows normal tone and orientation. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, and liver enzymes. Imaging reveals mild acute pancreatitis and a focal segmental right gonadal vein thrombosis. The patient is currently receiving IV heparin and other medications. He requires close monitoring for potential complications such as infections, arrhythmias, and further thrombotic events."

The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of alcoholism, polysubstance abuse, and chronic viral hepatitis who presents for voluntary admission for detoxification. She has been experiencing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including diaphoresis, persistent tachycardia, anxiety, and tremors. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 144/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Her physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, overweight/obese, anxious, and diaphoretic. The patient's laboratory results indicate mild acute pancreatitis and a possible right gonadal vein thrombosis. She also has elevated liver enzymes, low albumin levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging shows mild peripancreatic stranding in the region of the pancreatic head, suggesting mild acute pancreatitis. The patient is currently receiving diazepam and morphine for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and has been given ampicillin/sulbactam. She has been placed on aggressive intravenous fluids and will be monitored closely for any complications.

   40 year old woman with a h/o alcoholism c/b DTs/seizures 2 years ago,
   polysubstance abuse including IV heroin, cocaine, crack (last use 2
   years ago), heroin inhalation (last use 2 days ago), hep C, presents
   for voluntary admission for detox.
   .
   # ETOH Withdrawal-given h/o severe DTs/seizures observation in ICU is
   reasonable. Pt requiring more valium however stable overnight.
   Diaphoresis, persistent tachycardia, anxiety, and tremors point to
   insufficiently controlled withdrawl symptoms.
   -Increasing valium from Valium 10mg PO Q2H to Valium 10mg PO Q1H for
   CIWA>10; hold for CIWA<10 or signs of intoxication, low threshold to
   increase dose or switch to IV if pt worsens scores or becomes
   hemodynamically unstable.
   -Continue MVI, Thiamine, Folate
   -Continue Aggressive IVF
   -Replete lytes with close attention to K and Mg
   -SW consult today
   .
   # Ovarian vein thrombosis: Pt at risk given her recent birth and recent
   C-section.
   -F/u  blood cx
   -Continue heparin gtt
   -Continue amp-sulbactam 3gm IV Q6H
   -Obtain MRV today to confirm dx, if negative, would DC abx and heparin.
   If positive, pt would require at least 2 weeks of IV abx and
   anticoagulation.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Elevated Lipase/Pancreatitis and CT abdomen
   consistent with mild pancreatitis with a Ransen score of 3. However,
   her abdominal pain is lower quadrant. She has other potential reasons
   for pain including heroin withdrawl, biliary disease (although per rads
   no e/o biliary disease on CT), and most intriguing ovarian vein
   thrombosis can p/w lower abdominal pain, N/V.  RUQ negative for e/o
   biliary disease, portal vein thrombosis, but did show e/o early
   cirrhosis.
   -IVF
   -Slowly advance diet starting with clears
   -Pain control with morphine 2-4mg IV Q4H PRN for now, will evaluate
   switching to methadone for more long acting pain based on her prior
   doses
   -F/u U/A with cx

   # Acute anemia: Likely secondary to hemodilution given pt was
   significantly dry. Consider worsening pancreatitis. Consider alcoholic
   gastritis.
   -Active type and screen

   -Recheck HCT at 1700
   -Starting Pantoprazole 40mg PO Daily

   # Acute thrombocytopenia: Again likely secondary to hemodilution.
   Because she was likely dehydrated this admission we are seeing her true
   values which are low. Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to HCV
   cirrhosis.
   -Recheck platelets at 1700, with low threshold to stop heparin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of alcoholism, polysubstance abuse, hepatitis C, and previous episodes of delirium tremens and seizures. She has been admitted voluntarily for detoxification.

The patient is currently experiencing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including diaphoresis, persistent tachycardia, anxiety, and tremors. Her withdrawal symptoms are not adequately controlled with Valium, and her dose has been increased from 10mg PO Q2H to 10mg PO Q1H for CIWA scores greater than 10. If her CIWA score worsens or if she becomes hemodynamically unstable, she will be switched to IV Valium.

The patient also has several other medical complications, including acute pancreatitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, acute anemia, acute thrombocytopenia, and chronic viral hepatitis C. These conditions are being managed with appropriate medications and treatments.

The patient's abdominal pain is suspected to be caused by pancreatitis, heroin withdrawal, biliary disease, or ovarian vein thrombosis. Further evaluation and management are planned, including imaging studies and pain control.

The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia are thought to be secondary to hemodilution and dehydration. Thrombocytopenia may also be chronic due to hepatitis C cirrhosis. Close monitoring of platelet and hematoc"

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of alcoholism and polysubstance abuse, presenting for voluntary admission for alcohol detoxification. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including acute pancreatitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), chronic viral hepatitis, and anemia. The patient is currently being treated in the ICU for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and is showing improvement with decreased tremors, anxiety, and diaphoresis. Her vital signs are stable, and she is tolerating oral intake.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Seizures: The patient has a history of DTs/seizures, which can occur during alcohol withdrawal. Continuous monitoring and close observation are necessary to prevent and manage any potential seizures.

2. Hepatitis C complications: The patient has an uncontrolled hepatitis C infection with a high viral load. This increases the risk of liver disease progression, including cirrhosis and liver failure. Outpatient GI/liver follow-up is recommended to manage the hepatitis C.

3. DVT complications: The patient has confirmed ovarian vein thrombosis, and there is a risk of developing further thrombotic events. Close monitoring for signs of worsening DVT or new thrombotic events is essential. Treatment with anticoagulants, such as heparin and lovenox, is ongoing to prevent clot formation and extension.

4. Pancreatitis complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted for alcohol detoxification. The patient's medical history includes chronic viral hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, and alcohol abuse. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (110 bpm) and blood pressure (143/68 mmHg). Respiratory rate is within normal range (20 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is at 99%. The patient's temperature is slightly below normal (36.9°C). 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST), as well as increased amylase and lipase levels, indicating possible liver and pancreatic involvement. The presence of a right inferior gonadal vein thrombus on the MRV is noted, along with a high HCV viral load. Blood and urine cultures from the previous day are pending.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, diazepam (Valium), and morphine sulfate. Pantoprazole (Protonix) and ampicillin/sulbactam (Unasyn) were administered previously.

The patient's review of systems is mostly unchanged from admission, except for abdominal pain. The physical examination focuses on cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic assessments, although some areas were not assessed.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's chronic viral hepatitis and history of alcohol abuse may contribute to ongoing liver damage. Ac"

   # ETOH Withdrawal-given h/o severe DTs/seizures observation in ICU is
   reasonable. Pt requiring more valium however stable overnight.
   Diaphoresis, persistent tachycardia, anxiety, and tremors point to
   insufficiently controlled withdrawl symptoms.
   -Increasing valium from Valium 10mg PO Q2H to Valium 10mg PO Q1H for
   CIWA>10; hold for CIWA<10 or signs of intoxication, low threshold to
   increase dose or switch to IV if pt worsens scores or becomes

   -Obtain MRV today to confirm dx, if negative, would DC abx and heparin.
   If positive, pt would require at least 2 weeks of IV abx and
   anticoagulation.

   # Abdominal pain: Elevated Lipase/Pancreatitis and CT abdomen
   consistent with mild pancreatitis with a Ransen score of 3. However,
   her abdominal pain is lower quadrant. She has other potential reasons
   for pain including heroin withdrawl, biliary disease (although per rads
   no e/o biliary disease on CT), and most intriguing ovarian vein
   thrombosis can p/w lower abdominal pain, N/V.  RUQ negative for e/o
   biliary disease, portal vein thrombosis, but did show e/o early
   cirrhosis.
   -IVF
   -Slowly advance diet starting with clears

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of alcoholism, presenting for voluntary admission for alcohol detoxification. She has a history of severe delirium tremens/seizures, polysubstance abuse including IV heroin and cocaine use, hepatitis C, and presents with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as diaphoresis, persistent tachycardia, anxiety, and tremors. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her withdrawal symptoms. She also has acute anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are likely secondary to hemodilution. The patient has signs consistent with mild pancreatitis, ovarian vein thrombosis, and chronic viral hepatitis. Further investigations and treatments are ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome: The patient is showing signs of inadequate control of withdrawal symptoms, which can progress to severe complications such as seizures or delirium tremens.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a right inferior gonadal vein thrombus, putting her at risk for further clot formation and potential complications like pulmonary embolism.
3. Acute pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels and CT findings consistent with mild pancreatitis. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation.
4. Ovarian vein thrombosis: This condition can cause abdominal pain, fever, and potential complications like septic"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a h/o alcoholism c/b DTs/seizures 2 years ago,
   polysubstance abuse including IV heroin, cocaine, crack (last use 2
   years ago), heroin inhalation (last use 2 days ago), hep C, presents
   for voluntary admission for detox.
   .
   # ETOH Withdrawal-given h/o severe DTs/seizures observation in ICU is
   reasonable. Pt requiring more valium however stable overnight.
   Diaphoresis, persistent tachycardia, anxiety, and tremors point to
   insufficiently controlled withdrawl symptoms.
   -Increasing valium from Valium 10mg PO Q2H to Valium 10mg PO Q1H for
   CIWA>10; hold for CIWA<10 or signs of intoxication, low threshold to
   increase dose or switch to IV if pt worsens scores or becomes
   hemodynamically unstable.
   -Continue MVI, Thiamine, Folate
   -Continue Aggressive IVF
   -Replete lytes with close attention to K and Mg
   -SW consult today
   .
   # Ovarian vein thrombosis: Pt at risk given her recent birth and recent
   C-section.
   -F/u  blood cx
   -Continue heparin gtt
   -Continue amp-sulbactam 3gm IV Q6H
   -Obtain MRV today to confirm dx, if negative, would DC abx and heparin.
   If positive, pt would require at least 2 weeks of IV abx and
   anticoagulation.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Elevated Lipase/Pancreatitis and CT abdomen
   consistent with mild pancreatitis with a Ransen score of 3. However,
   her abdominal pain is lower quadrant. She has other potential reasons
   for pain including heroin withdrawl, biliary disease (although per rads
   no e/o biliary disease on CT), and most intriguing ovarian vein
   thrombosis can p/w lower abdominal pain, N/V.  RUQ negative for e/o
   biliary disease, portal vein thrombosis, but did show e/o early
   cirrhosis.
   -IVF
   -Slowly advance diet starting with clears
   -Pain control with morphine 2-4mg IV Q4H PRN for now, will evaluate
   switching to methadone for more long acting pain based on her prior
   doses
   -F/u U/A with cx
   .
   # Acute anemia: Likely secondary to hemodilution given pt was
   significantly dry. Consider worsening pancreatitis. Consider alcoholic
   gastritis.
   -Active type and screen
   -Guiac all stools
   -Recheck HCT at 1700
   -Starting Pantoprazole 40mg PO Daily
   .
   # Acute thrombocytopenia: Again likely secondary to hemodilution.
   Because she was likely dehydrated this admission we are seeing her true
   values which are low. Chronic thrombocytopenia likely secondary to HCV
   cirrhosis.
   -Recheck platelets at 1700, with low threshold to stop heparin
   .
   # Hep C: Unknown extent.
   -Check viral load
   -Obtaining records from [**Hospital1 587**]
   .
   # Polysubstance abuse:
   -SW consult
   -Check HIV for high risk behavior
   .
   # FEN: NPO, IVF, replete electrolytes
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt
   # Access: 2 peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Confirmed Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: Likely called out to floor tomorrow if stable overnight.

- She was admitted voluntarily for alcohol detoxification.
- The patient has shown symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including diaphoresis, persistent tachycardia, anxiety, and tremors.
- Her CIWA score increased to Q4, indicating severe withdrawal symptoms.
- She is currently on valium 10mg PO Q1H and morphine sulfate as needed for pain control.
- The patient also has acute pancreatitis with elevated lipase levels and a Ransen score of 3.
- She has a pelvic clot, fatty liver, and mild pancreatitis.
- The patient is being treated for possible septic pelvic thrombophlebitis with antibiotics and heparin.
- She is hypertensive, likely in the setting of withdrawal.
- The patient has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and chronic viral hepatitis.
- She requires ongoing monitoring and management of her withdrawal symptoms, pain control, infection, and other medical conditions.
- Imaging studies have shown evidence of a right inferior gonadal vein thrombus, but normal appearance and flow in the left gonadal vein.
- The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures from 02/06 are pending.
- She is at risk for ovarian vein thrombosis, given her recent birth and C-section.
