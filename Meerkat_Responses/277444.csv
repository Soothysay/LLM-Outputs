   Assessment and Plan
 ANEMIA, OTHER
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD,
   admit from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis/Elevated Lactate: ABG 7.22/23/103. AG 16. Lactate
   4.5. Based on Winter's formula, she has primary metabolic lactate
   acidosis with adequate respiratory compensation. SIRS is most likely
   with possible sources being urine, peritoneal fluid, lungs.
   - Continue Broad Spectrum antibiotics with Vanc/Zosyn, can DC
   ceftriaxone while on Zosyn (Kleb from peritoneal fluid sensitive to
   both)
   - Work up other infectious causes as above with blood cx, urine cx, abd
   us to eval for cholangitis in setting of rising bili/lfts
   - Trend renal failure as below - add. component to AG acidosis is
   worsening renal failure
   - Will give 150 mEq Sodium Bicarbonate/ 1000 mL D5W
   Continuous at 100 ml/hr for 1000 ml
   .
   # Altered mental status - likely hepatic encephalopathy triggered by
   SBP and hepatorenal syndrome. Currently unable to take PO's due to AMS.
   Attempted to place NG tube at bedside, unable to place due to patient
   becoming very agitated.
   -Lactulose enema now and qshift
   -hold po's pending improved mental status
   -reattempt NGT in am for meds (esp rfiaximin, lactulose)
   administration
   -treat SBP, hepatorenal as below
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome - likely triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with
   only 25gm albumin. Failed IVF challenge at OSH. Oliguric.
   -octreotide/midodrine
   -albumin 50 g daily
   -follw urine output- if remains oliguric, will need renal consult for
   initiation of HD in next few days
   -hold off on repeat para for now, may need small volume tap for comfort
   in next few days
   .
   # SBP: klebsiella (micro in chart, R only to ampicillin
   -given concern for UTI and worsening of WBC and overall clinic status
   while on CTX will broaden to zosyn (previously received 5 days) -
   discuss duration of abx with liver team in am (typically treat x 5
   days)
   -will need PPX once abx course completed
   -check blood, urine cx as above
   .
   # Hyperkalemia - in setting of renal failure, no peaked T waves on ECG
   - Insulin/D50
   - Kayexelate
   - [**Month (only) 60**] require HD if no improvement in urine output
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis - decompensated w/ varices, massive ascites s/p tips,
   encephalopathy. Awaiting transplant.
   -treat complications as above
   -labs pending, will recalculate meld once labs return
   -check abd u/s with dopplers to assess tips, hepatic and portal flow
   .
   # Pancytopenia - CBC at baseline.
   .
   # DM2 - continue lantus, and HISS, but 1/2 dose while NPO
   .
   # Seizure disorder -
   - continue carbamazepine.
   - if still unable to take PO in am, may need to curbside neuro for
   conversion to IV medication
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety. - holding psych meds due to delta MS.
   .
   # PPx:
   - pneumoboots, lactulose.
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now given MS.
   .
   # Access PIV X2
   # Code: Full
   # Dispo: pending improvement.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status and encephalopathy. 

The patient underwent several procedures and interventions, including ultrasound, paracentesis, invasive ventilation, multi-lumen insertion, arterial line placement, and sodium bicarbonate administration. 

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the 80s, despite receiving vasopressors. The patient's respiratory rate is elevated at 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 100%. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The D-dimer level is extremely elevated, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient's condition is complicated by several issues, including respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia. The patient also has a history of HCV cirrhosis, massive ascites post-transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and awaiting transplant. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, development of hepatic encephalopathy, progression of hepatorenal syndrome, exacerbation of metabolic acidosis, and further deterioration of renal function. 

The patient requires close monitoring and management of these complications, including appropriate antibiotic therapy, treatment of hepatorenal syndrome, management of altered mental status, and supportive care for the various organ dysfunctions."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The note details the various interventions and procedures performed on the patient, including ultrasound, paracentesis, invasive ventilation, multi-lumen insertion, arterial line placement, and blood product transfusions.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypotension despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) has been maintained at around 60 mmHg using a combination of vasopressin and norepinephrine.

The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has decreased from 24% to 22% despite receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), suggesting ongoing bleeding or hemodynamic instability. The patient's D-dimer levels are extremely elevated, which suggests disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, as indicated by the need for invasive ventilation and the presence of metabolic acidosis. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.26, indicating acidosis.

Additionally, the patient has evidence of liver dysfunction, as shown by elevated liver enzymes and a low albumin level. The patient also has renal impairment, with increased creatinine levels.

Overall, the patient's current medical complications include acute respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, anemia, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and TIPS procedure. She was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated, and she is now experiencing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with severe sepsis, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has an infection caused by Klebsiella species, leading to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). This infection has led to septic shock and multiorgan dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, necessitating mechanical ventilation. She is currently on PCV+/PSV mode with a set respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, tidal volume of 266 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient likely has HRS, which is a type of acute kidney injury associated with liver disease. HRS can lead to oliguria, elevated creatinine levels, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient exhibits signs of DIC, including thromb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and recent TIPS procedure. She presents with HRS, DIC, SBP, and ileus. The patient is in renal failure and has been given lactulose enemas for the upper GI. She is currently on octreotide and midodrine. Her vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure in the 80s, and she has an elevated central venous pressure. The patient is receiving multiple vasopressors and has been intubated for respiratory failure. She is sedated and unable to provide a history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's liver disease has led to kidney dysfunction, which can result in HRS. This condition is characterized by renal failure due to severe liver disease without another identifiable cause of kidney dysfunction. It requires urgent management.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in coagulation parameters, suggesting DIC. DIC is a serious condition characterized by systemic activation of blood clotting, which can lead to multiple organ failure.
3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has SBP, which is an infection of the ascites fluid. SBP is a common and potentially life-threatening complication in patients with cirrhosis.
4. Acute Respiratory Dist"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, now presenting with HRS and DIC. The patient is also experiencing SBP and ileus. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/46 to 79/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. 

Medical interventions include invasive ventilation, arterial line placement, paracentesis, and multi-lumen catheter insertion. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit levels, prolonged platelet count, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals bibasilar lung infiltrates, multiple ascites fluid levels, and no hematomas. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including anemia, respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

Assessment and plan include monitoring bladder pressure, continuing albumin administration, replacing products with set goals if INR < 2, platelets > 30, Hct < 25, and fibrinogen < 100. The patient's DIC should be managed by treating the underlying cause,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's family has agreed to continue aggressive care. The patient received 5 units of fresh frozen plasma, 3 units of packed red blood cells, and 1 unit of platelets overnight due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's vital signs remain stable with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/49 to 155/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 146 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.28, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 308, and ventilation efficiency of 8.7 L/min. The patient's laboratory values indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine level, low fibrinogen level, and other abnormalities. The patient's renal function is impaired, and he has been considered for renal replacement therapy (RRT) today. The patient also has spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute respiratory failure, anemia, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, and other conditions. The patient is being closely monitored and managed with appropriate ICU care."

   good effect. Continues to have acid/base derangements secondary to
   renal failure and with the magnitude of her ascites would be unable to
   breath at the minute ventilation required to compensate. Paracentesis
   is an option to help with her volume status, however, she reaccumulates
   very quickly and would not provide a good solution to her acidosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who presented to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, altered mental status, and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Continued monitoring and management of respiratory status is crucial.

2. Septic Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock secondary to SBP. She has been treated with antibiotics and pressors but is now off both. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued administration of appropriate antibiotics are essential.

3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has evidence of DIC, which may be secondary to sepsis. Monitoring of coagulation parameters and timely administration of blood products as per the laboratory results are important.

4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, likely triggered by the large volume of paracentesis performed on [**2-24**]. Renal function should be closely monitored, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) is planned.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic enceph"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who has undergone TIPS and now presents with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She also has spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), ileus, and is experiencing acute respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. She is currently on multiple medications, including lactulose enemas, octreotide, midodrine, albumin, antibiotics, anticoagulants, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, but her lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and coagulation parameters. The patient's clinical course is being closely monitored, and interventions are being implemented to manage her various conditions."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who underwent TIPS and is now presenting with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and altered mental status. The patient has been on pressors, but is now off them. She has been diagnosed with renal failure, shock (resolving), and is receiving antibiotics for suspected infection. Her vital signs include a blood pressure of 172/70 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and a central venous pressure of 45 mmHg. She has a high bladder pressure of 38-42 mmHg and is on mechanical ventilation with PCV+/PSV mode, tidal volume of 146 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 25 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 19 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) deferred. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.24, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2 of 308 mmHg, HCO3- of 16 mEq/L, base excess of -8 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 3.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 33 K/uL, creatinine of 3.4 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 31.2 mg/dL, albumin of 4.2 g/dL, lactate acid of 2.3 mmol/L, and D-dimer of 7924 ng/mL. The patient's chest X-ray is pending. The assessment and plan include renal failure, DIC, SBP, anemia, respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, and other conditions. The patient is being managed with various treatments and interventions for her multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progression of renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels and the diagnosis of acute renal failure. If left untreated, this could lead to further deterioration of renal function and potentially end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
2. Complications of DIC: The patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting. Complications of DIC may include bleeding due to consumption of platelets and clotting factors, organ damage, and increased risk of infections.
3. SBP recurrence: Despite receiving appropriate treatment for SBP, there is a risk of recurrence, especially in patients with advanced liver disease like this patient. Recurrence of SBP can lead to worsening sepsis and potentially fatal outcomes.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ARDS.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome progression: Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a type of kidney failure that occurs in advanced liver disease. If left untreated, HRS can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.24, indicating metabolic acidosis. If not managed properly, metabolic acidosis can lead to complications such as severe acidemia and multiorgan dysfunction.
7. Infections: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of various invasive lines and devices, there is a risk of hospital-acquired infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD,
   admit from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome with
   respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient waking up this morning and was not
   synchronous with the vent (on PCV) so she was transitioned to MMV with
   good effect. Continues to have acid/base derangements secondary to
   renal failure and with the magnitude of her ascites would be unable to
   breath at the minute ventilation required to compensate. Paracentesis
   is an option to help with her volume status, however, she reaccumulates
   very quickly and would not provide a good solution to her acidosis.
   -          RRT for acid base status and probable continued wean
   -          Can consider paracentesis
   -          Attempt SBP after HD
   # Septic Shock
 likely source was SBP. Cultures not growing any
   bacteria at this time, and she continues on Zosyn for this. Vanco also
   added for ?pna. Patient seems to be improving, now off both pressors
   and hypertensive.
   -          continue to follow cultures
   -          continue abx
   -          MAP>65
   .
   # DIC:  patient has several reasons to cause DIC, but most likely is
   sepsis.   Received multiple products overnight.
   -- q6h hct, plts, coags and fibrinogen
   -- transfuse PRBC for HCT < 25
   -- transfuse FFP for INR > 2
   -- transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   -- PPI IV BID
   # Hepatorenal syndrome - likely triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with
   only 25gm albumin. Patient is currently oliguric.  Renal has been
   following.  She is now off pressors, and continues on albumin 50g/[**Hospital1 **].
   -f/u renal recs
   -cont albumin 50g [**Hospital1 **]
   -hopeful for RRT to begin today as discussed above
   -consider restarting midodrine if tolerates TF
   # Altered mental status - likely hepatic encephalopathy triggered by
   SBP and hepatorenal syndrome.  Currently sedated for mechanical
   ventilation. NGT has reduced output. Can try to use GI route again
   today.
   -hold PO meds to IV
   -can retry PO lactulose
   -treat SBP, hepatorenal as below
   # Hyperkalemia - in setting of renal failure, currently stable
   - kayexalate for K+ > 5.5

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome with respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. Acid/base derangements secondary to renal failure and massive ascites are contributing factors. Paracentesis may be considered to help with volume status, but reaccumulation is rapid and may not provide a good solution to acidosis. RRT for acid-base status and probable continued wean is planned. Paracentesis and SBP attempt after HD are also considered.

- Sepsis Shock: The likely source was SBP. Cultures did not grow any bacteria, and the patient continues on Zosyn. Vancomycin was added for?PNA. The patient appears to be improving, now off both pressors and hypertensive. Continuing to follow cultures, continuing antibiotics, and maintaining MAP >65 are planned.

- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has multiple reasons for DIC, most likely due to sepsis. The patient received multiple products overnight. Monitoring of hct, plts, coags, and fibrinogen every 6 hours, along with transfusion of PRBC, FFP, and cryo as indicated, is planned. PPI IV BID is also prescribed."

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU for encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome with respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She also has massive ascites and is awaiting a liver transplant.

The patient's current medical conditions and plans include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to encephalopathy. She will be weaned off the ventilator as tolerated.
2. Sepsis Shock: The likely source of sepsis was spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She was initially treated with cefotaxime but has been broadened to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam due to decompensation. Cultures have been negative since admission.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient likely has DIC secondary to sepsis/liver failure. Her platelet count is low, and she received 2u platelets which did not rise appropriately.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome likely triggered by a large paracentesis on [02-24]. She is currently oliguric and will be followed closely. CVVH was attempted but the line clotted off, so the plan is to start hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 122/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows a loud L parasternal murmur, and her peripheral vascular examination reveals bilateral edema. The respiratory/chest examination shows ronchorous breath sounds. Abdominal examination reveals bowel sounds distant, a distended abdomen, and a fluid wave. Extremities show 4+ edema bilaterally, and the skin examination shows warmth, well-perfused skin with oozing from multiple sites.

Laboratory results include a WBC count of 5.7, Hct of 30.5, platelet count of 31,000, creatinine of 4.4, TCO2 of 18, glucose of 136, and other lab values within normal ranges. Urine culture shows yeast, and CXR shows evolving bibasilar infiltrates.

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who underwent TIPS and now presents with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She also has spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), bibasilar pneumonia, and ileus. The patient is currently off pressors and is in shock, which is resolving. Her renal function is progressively deteriorating. 

The plan includes continuing albumin, lactulose, and octreotide for HRS, as well as trying rifaximin. Hemodialysis (HD) has been performed, and a tap will be done later today after HD. The patient's bladder pressure is high, so it will need to be followed closely today. 

For DIC, the patient's condition is being controlled with product replacement, and fibrinogen levels are rising. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (MV) at a tidal volume of 500 mL with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Weaning of sedation and ventilation will be done after procedures. The patient will need to achieve negative fluid balance, improved mental status, and decreased abdominal pressures before attempting exubation. 

The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) requires adjustment of lantus and risse, while her seizure disorder needs a change from carbamazepine to keppra IV. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD,
   admit from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome with
   respiratory failure.
    # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated [**2-28**] encephalopathy.
   Currently on MMV as patient did not tolerate PS likely [**2-28**] massive
   ascites.  Will attempt to wean as tolerated.  Will change
   fentany/versed to propofol given liver failure.
   -                Paracentesis today
   -                Wean as tolerated
   -                SBT as tolerated
    # Septic Shock
 likely source was SBP. Which grew Klebsiella at OSH
   sensitive to CTX.  Given decompensation, she has been broadened to
   Vanco/Zosyn.  Cultures have been negative here
   -          continue to follow cultures
   -          continue Vanco/Zosyn for 10 day course
   -          MAP>65
   # DIC:  Most likely [**2-28**] sepsis/liver failure.    HCT, fibrinogen has
   remained stable.  PLT < 30 overnight and received 2u Platelets, which
   did not rise appropriately.
   -- q8h hct, plts, coags and fibrinogen
   -- transfuse PRBC for HCT < 25
   -- transfuse FFP for INR > 2
   -- transfuse cryo for fibrinogen <100
   -- PPI IV BID
   # Hepatorenal syndrome - likely triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with
   only 25gm albumin. Patient is currently oliguric.  Renal has been
   following.  She is now off pressors.  Holding daily albumin.  Patient
   was on CVVH this morning but line has clotted off.  Currently, plan is
   to stop CVVH and start HD tomorrow.
   -f/u renal recs
   -consider restarting midodrine if tolerates TF
    # Altered mental status - likely hepatic encephalopathy triggered by
   SBP and hepatorenal syndrome.  Currently sedated for mechanical
   ventilation. NGT has reduced output, will restart lactulose today.  If
   begins to stool then will restart rifaximin.
   -hold PO meds to IV
   -can retry PO lactulose
   -treat SBP, hepatorenal as above
   # Hyperkalemia - in setting of renal failure, currently stable
   - kayexalate for K+ > 5.5
   # HCV cirrhosis - decompensated w/ varices, massive ascites s/p tips,
   encephalopathy. Awaiting transplant.
   -treat complications as above
   - f/u liver recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and recent TIPS procedure. She was admitted with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome and is currently in respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications including septic shock, DIC, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, and decompensated HCV cirrhosis. She also has diabetes mellitus type 2, a seizure disorder, and depression/anxiety. The patient is being treated with multiple medications and interventions for her various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure. She will be switched from MMV to CPAP/PS mode given her minute ventilation rate. Continuous monitoring and support are necessary.
2. Sepsis/Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock, possibly from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Cultures continue to be negative, and the white blood cell count is trending down. Monitoring of cultures and ongoing treatment with Zosyn and Vancomycin are recommended.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient may have DIC, likely secondary to sepsis/liver failure. Platelets are low, and coagulation parameters are abnormal. Close monitoring of coagulation status and transfusion of blood products as needed are essential.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, and altered mental status.

24-hour events include a low vancomycin level, administration of vancomycin 500mg IV, therapeutic paracentesis with removal of 3.5 liters of fluid, decrease in white blood cell (WBC) count, no signs of bowel perforation or pneumoperitoneum on chest X-ray, and administration of platelets due to low platelet count. The patient has not had a bowel movement overnight.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/87mmHg to 90/52mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 99.5 kg at admission to 103.7 kg.

Fluid balance shows a net loss of 3,726 mL over the past 24 hours. Respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings are not available due to the patient's intubation. Lab results indicate abnormalities in potassium, bicarbonate, glucose, and liver function tests. Imaging studies are pending.

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of renal failure, DIC, SBP, anemia, acute respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has SBP and altered mental status, which increases the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or worsening infection is essential.
2. Bleeding: The patient has DIC, which can lead to bleeding complications. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters and close observation for signs of bleeding are necessary.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and mechanical ventilation is currently being used. Close monitoring of respiratory status and adjustments in ventilator settings may be required.
4. Renal function deterioration: The patient has renal failure and hepatorenal syndrome. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting treatment accordingly is crucial.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, and ongoing monitoring of acid-base balance is necessary. Correction of underlying causes and supportive care may be required.
6. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which can be due to various causes such as hep"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, who has undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. She presents with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and low-grade resolving disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) following spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and bibasilar pneumonia. The patient also has acute renal failure, respiratory failure, anemia, and altered mental status. Her ileus is resolving, and sepsis has been resolved.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 119/105 to 137/127 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, platelet count of 61 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 30.7 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.3 mg/dL, glucose level of 176 mg/dL, and liver enzymes within normal range. Other lab results indicate a presence of DIC, with elevated D-dimer and low fibrinogen levels. Additionally, the patient has elevated lactic acid levels, decreased albumin levels, and normal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple medical complications including renal failure, DIC, SBP, anemia, respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, and altered mental status. The plan includes continuing vancomycin for 7 days and piperacillin/tazobactam for 10 days. The patient's ileus is expected to continue resolving, and efforts will be made to advance her diet. Sedation will be weaned off, and the patient will be monitored for potential seizures. ICU care will include glycemic control, nutrition support, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and recent TIPS procedure. She presents with HRS and low-grade resolving DIC due to Klebsiella SBP and bibasilar pneumonia. The patient has had an ileus that is resolving, sepsis that has been resolved, and is currently experiencing altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is a potential complication of her underlying conditions, including HCV cirrhosis and CKD.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has low-grade resolving DIC, which can be a complication of sepsis or severe infections.
3. Peritonitis, spontaneous bacterial (SBP): The patient had SBP caused by Klebsiella, which can lead to complications such as sepsis and organ failure.
4. Anemia, other: The patient's anemia may be related to chronic kidney disease or blood loss.
5. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia and her underlying liver disease.
6. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient's HRS is a potential complication of her cirrhosis and may worsen renal function.
7. Acidosis, metabolic: The patient may have metabolic acidosis due to the underlying conditions or complications.

   # Septic Shock
 likely source was SBP. Cultures continue to be
   negative and WBC trending down on most recent para.
   -          continue to follow cultures
   -          continue Zosyn for 10 day course, Vanco for 7 day course
   -          MAP>65 (off pressors for 48 hours)

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute renal failure, anemia, altered mental status, and metabolic acidosis. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which indicates the severity of her respiratory failure. If the ventilation is not properly managed, there is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Septic shock: Although the patient's WBC count is trending down, indicating improvement, there is still a risk of septic shock recurrence due to ongoing infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and timely administration of antibiotics are crucial to prevent complications associated with sepsis.

3. DIC: The patient has been diagnosed with DIC, a serious condition characterized by the formation of blood clots throughout the body. This can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not managed promptly. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate transfusion therapy are essential to manage DIC effectively.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and recent TIPS procedure. She was admitted with encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure and lethargic with likely hepatic encephalopathy. She has ongoing septic shock likely triggered by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which has been treated with antibiotics. The patient also has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status, and complications of HCV cirrhosis including varices and massive ascites.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to respiratory failure. Extubation may be attempted if mental status improves, but there is a risk of reintubation if the patient does not tolerate spontaneous breathing.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of recurrent sepsis due to her compromised immune system and ongoing infection. Cultures will continue to be monitored, and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be continued.
3. DIC: The patient has evidence of DIC with low platelet count and prolonged clotting times. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and transfusion of blood products as needed will be important to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type"

   58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD, admit from OSH with
   encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome with respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated [**2-28**] encephalopathy.  Off
   sedation.  Patient remains lethargic not waking to commands, this is
   likely [**2-28**] encephalopathy.  Benzos may still be in her system as well
   given her renal and liver failure.  Will cont to monitor.
   -  if <10 peep, try RSBI
   -  may attempt to extubate tomorrow if mental status improves
   # Septic Shock
 likely source was SBP. Cultures continue to be
   negative and WBC trending down on most recent para.
   -          continue to follow cultures
   -          continue Zosyn for 10 day course, Vanco for 7 day course
   -          MAP>65 (off pressors for 48 hours)
   # DIC:  Most likely [**2-28**] sepsis/liver failure.  HCT, fibrinogen has
   remained stable.  PLT < 30 overnight and received 1u Platelets.
   -- [**Hospital1 **] hct, plts, coags and fibrinogen
   -- transfuse PRBC for HCT < 25

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, who was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. She is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including septic shock, likely triggered by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status, decompensated HCV cirrhosis with varices and massive ascites, type 2 diabetes mellitus, seizure disorder, and depression/anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains lethargic and not waking to commands, suggesting ongoing respiratory failure. Monitoring will continue, and extubation may be attempted tomorrow if mental status improves.
2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient likely had SBP as the source of sepsis. Cultures are negative, and WBC count is trending down. Zosyn and Vancomycin will be continued for their respective courses.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has evidence of DIC, likely secondary to sepsis and liver failure. Coagulation parameters should be closely monitored, and appropriate blood products may be required.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, which is likely triggered by the large para-central venous hypertonic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and TIPS, currently presenting with multiple medical complications. These include acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, acute respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, and intermittent ileus. The patient's condition is critically ill, and the attending physician's assessment and plan outline various interventions and treatments aimed at addressing these complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening of renal function, development or progression of DIC, complications related to SBP such as sepsis or organ failure, worsening of liver dysfunction, respiratory distress or failure, and potential neurological complications due to encephalopathy or seizures.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical parameters to detect any changes or deterioration in her condition promptly. Timely intervention and adjustments to the treatment plan may be necessary to prevent or manage potential complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and is currently experiencing hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and low-grade resolving disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to Klebsiella spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and bibasilar pneumonia. The patient also has acute renal failure, respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/63 to 167/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 390 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with bowel sounds present, fluid wave suggestive of ascites, and a loud left parasternal murmur. Neurologically, the patient is obtunded.

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating renal impairment. Other lab findings include leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who presented with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and later diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient also has evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hepatic encephalopathy, and complications related to her chronic liver disease, such as varices and massive ascites.

The patient underwent paracentesis, during which she developed hypotension and required blood product transfusion. She received packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and cryoprecipitate to correct coagulopathy and improve oxygen carrying capacity.

The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with ongoing mechanical ventilation and sedation. She has not responded well to weaning from mechanical ventilation due to altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further episodes of SBP, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and bleeding secondary to DIC. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, coagulation profile, and neurologic status is crucial.

Overall, the patient's ICU course has been complex and challenging, with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) involving the liver, kidneys, and lungs."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, diabetes mellitus type 2, seizure disorder, and depression/anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary, and extubation may be considered if the mental status improves.
2. Sepsis/Shock: The patient had likely septic shock, possibly secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Cultures have been negative, and the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. Continued monitoring of the patient's vital signs and organ functions is essential.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has evidence of DIC, likely secondary to sepsis/liver failure. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters, including platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and fibrinogen levels, is necessary. Appropriate transfusions of platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and cryoprecipitate may be"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient underwent a paracentesis, which was complicated by an intraabdominal bleed. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) dropped from 22 to 15 despite transfusions, but has now improved to 28 after receiving 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 2 bags of platelets, 2 units of cryoprecipitate, and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient has been weaned off levophed and has shown improvement in mental status. The patient's respiratory failure is due to encephalopathy, and they are currently intubated. There are no new findings on the most recent chest X-ray. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and they are being treated with Zosyn and vancomycin. The patient has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to sepsis/liver failure, and they have received cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <100 in the setting of active bleeding yesterday. The patient also has hepatorenal syndrome, which was likely triggered by 11 liters of paracentesis on 02/24/2023. The patient is currently oliguric and has been on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU. She has several medical complications including hypotension, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, and altered mental status.

The patient's recent events include a paracentesis that resulted in hypotension and a drop in hematocrit (Hct), indicating an intraperitoneal bleed. She received a total of 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 2 units of cryoprecipitate, and 2 platelet transfusions. Her lactate levels and bladder pressure initially increased but are now improving. The patient has been on pressors but is currently off all sedation.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 03/06/2146 at 11:00 PM, erythromycin on 03/08/2146 at 12:45 PM, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 03/09/2146 at 04:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 98 beats per minute"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and TIPS. She is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including hypotension, HRS, low-grade resolving DIC, SBP, anemia, respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, and intermittent ileus.

24-hour events include a paracentesis that resulted in hypotension and a possible intraperitoneal bleed. The patient received a total transfusion of 8U PRBC, 3U FFP, 2 cryo, and 2 platelets. Lactate and bladder pressure levels have improved from 5.3 and 25 to 2.8 and 20, respectively. The patient is now off sedation, off all pressors, and able to follow simple commands intermittently.

Medical History:
The patient has allergies to Zanaflex (Tizanidine Hcl) and experiences hallucinations as a side effect. She was last given antibiotics on 03/06/2146 at 11:00 PM, 03/08/2146 at 12:45 PM, and 03/09/2146 at 04:00 AM.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension (not shock): The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure despite receiving transfusions.

2. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to the presence of massive ascites and ongoing losses.

3. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of acute renal failure.

4. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient is at risk for DIC, as indicated by low platelet count, prolonged clotting times, and elevated D-dimer levels.

5. Peritonitis, spontaneous bacterial (SBP): The patient had an intraabdominal bleed following a paracentesis, suggesting the possibility of SBP.

6. Anemia, other: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia.

7. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient was intubated due to encephalopathy and respiratory failure. Extubation may be attempted if mental status improves.

8. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, a condition characterized by kidney failure in patients with severe liver disease.

9. Acidosis, metabolic: The patient may have metabolic acidosis due to liver and renal failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's platelet count has decreased to less than 30,000/mm3, indicating a potential risk for bleeding. The patient did not tolerate a trial of spontaneous breathing, becoming tachypneic with a respiratory rate in the 40s. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 83-103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/48-140/74 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.9 degrees Celsius. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,607 mL and output of 1,815 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient has received a total of 1,190 mL of intravenous fluids and 1,347 mL of blood products. Urine output is low at 45 mL, while stool output is normal at 400 mL. 

The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results indicate abnormal liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, acute renal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and recent transplant surgery. She was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient underwent a paracentesis which was complicated by an intraabdominal bleed.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Intraabdominal Bleed: The patient had an intraabdominal bleed following paracentesis. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic stability is crucial. Further intervention may be required if the bleed does not stabilize.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. Improving mental status is a positive sign, indicating potential extubation in the future. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.

3. Sepsis/Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock, possibly secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Cultures continue to be negative, indicating no current bacterial infection. However, ongoing monitoring of vital signs and inflammatory markers is important to detect any signs of recurrent sepsis.

4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient shows signs of DIC, characterized by low platelet count, elevated D-dimer levels, and prolonged PT/PTT. This condition may be secondary to sepsis and liver failure. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and recent TIPS surgery. He was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome, and now presents with intraabdominal bleed following paracentesis. The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he self-extubated but is tolerating it well. He had septic shock that has resolved, and there is evidence of DIC that has also resolved. The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, HCV cirrhosis with varices and massive ascites, diabetes mellitus type 2, seizure disorder, and depression/anxiety. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraabdominal Bleed: The patient developed an intraabdominal bleed after paracentesis. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic stability is necessary. Trending HCT and coagulation parameters regularly is important. The goal is to achieve a HCT of 30, INR <2.0, platelets >50,000/mm3, and fibrinogen >100 mg/dL.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure secondary to AMS but has since improved. However, extubation may lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or respiratory muscle weakness. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is crucial.

3. Sepsis:"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient underwent a paracentesis procedure and had a pigtail drain placed.
- A total of 2 liters were initially drained, followed by an additional 600cc drained over the next 3 hours.
- The patient received albumin IV and had unplanned extubation, where they removed their own endotracheal tube.
- They received blood products including platelets, packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and desmopressin (DDAVP).
- The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis and was admitted with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome.
- The patient experienced an intraabdominal bleed after the paracentesis.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/53 to 154/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.
- The patient's neurologic status is improved, responding to verbal stimuli.
- The patient has a diagnosis of septic shock, likely caused by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and received antibiotics.
- The patient also has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is most likely secondary to sepsis/liver failure.
- The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, triggered by the large volume of para-cents on"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and resolving disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to Klebsiella spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and bibasilar pneumonia. She is also experiencing intermittent ileus, sepsis that has resolved, and altered mental status. The patient has self-extubated this morning but remains stable respiratorily. She has a poor cough and is unable to swallow safely, so a nasogastric tube (NGT) will be placed after a platelet transfusion. The patient's abdomen is softer post pigtail placement and will be discontinued this afternoon. She will also undergo hemodialysis (HD) today and is on the last day of Zosyn for SBP. The patient has a seizure disorder and is being treated with Keppra IV. Rest of the note can be found in the resident's note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and TIPS, presenting with HRS and low-grade resolving DIC. He has been diagnosed with Klebsiella SBP and bibasilar pneumonia. The patient experienced intermittent ileus, sepsis that has resolved, and self-extubated in the morning. He is stable respiratory-wise but has a poor cough and is unable to swallow safely. A NGT will be placed after platelet transfusion. The patient's abdomen is softer post pigtail placement. He will be discharged from the pigtail placement this afternoon and will undergo HD today. This is the last day of Zosyn for SBP. The patient is also on Keppra IV for seizure disorder. Rest per resident note. ICU care includes TF intermittent nutrition, glycemic control with lantus and ssi, and multi-lumen arterial line, dialysis catheter, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU. Total time spent is 45 minutes. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Alteration in nutrition: The patient may have difficulties meeting his nutritional needs due to intermittent TF and inability to swallow safely.
3. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's pre-existing CKD and current critical illness increase the risk of acute renal failure.
4. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has low-grade resolving DIC, indicating a potential risk of bleeding and clotting complications.
5. Peritonitis, spontaneous bacterial (SBP): The patient has been diagnosed with SBP, which can lead to abdominal infection and sepsis.
6. Anemia, other: The patient's low hemoglobin levels suggest possible anemia, which can contribute to tissue hypoxia.
7. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure.
8. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given the patient's history of liver cirrhosis and current kidney dysfunction, there is a risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome.
9. Acidosis, metabolic: The patient's elevated lactate levels suggest possible metabolic acidosis, which can impair tissue oxygenation.
10. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to multiple factors including liver dysfunction, infection, and medication effects."

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname 1112**] self extubated yesterday  and is
   requesting PO fluids. She is aware that she is in ICU at [**Hospital1 54**] but not
   much else. She is off Abx over past 24 hrs. all cultures have remained
   clean from repetitive belly taps. Hct respodned well to pRBC

   Agree with plan to slolwy advance PO's if menatl status allows. We will
   have low threshold for TPN if she cannot eat safely. She will need
   repeat paracentesis in 24-48 hrs and HD in the same time period. Also
   have low threshold for IV Vanco/ Diflucan to cover belly wounds till
   edema has subsided. hoepfully renal function will improve in a few
   days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and transplant surgery. She was admitted with encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, respiratory failure, and an intraabdominal bleed. The patient underwent paracentesis, which resulted in an intraabdominal bleed. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets. Her mental status improved, and she self-extubated but is tolerating extubation well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraabdominal bleed: The patient had an intraabdominal bleed following paracentesis. This complication requires close monitoring and appropriate management.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure associated with liver disease. It is essential to monitor her renal function and provide appropriate treatment.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure, but it has resolved since she self-extubated and is tolerating extubation well. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status is necessary.
4. Sepsis: The patient had septic shock, likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Cultures continue to be negative, indicating no current signs of infection. However, close observation and follow-up of cultures are required.
5. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. She underwent a paracentesis but experienced an intraabdominal bleed. The patient's vitals have been stable overnight, and her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) has remained relatively stable as well. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 4 plateslets. Her mental status has improved, and she is now alert, oriented, and moving all extremities. The patient is tolerating enteral feeding and has improved stooling. Imaging reveals an increase in perihilar haziness due to fluid overload, along with moderate pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraabdominal Bleed: The patient experienced an intraabdominal bleed following paracentesis. Close monitoring of vital signs and abdominal status is necessary to prevent further bleeding.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to acute mental status changes (AMS) and resolved respiratory failure. Self-extubation occurred, but the patient is tolerating extubation well.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient is likely suffering from hepatorenal syndrome, which may have been triggered by a large-volume paracentesis. Oliguria is currently"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented to the hospital with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. She underwent a paracentesis but experienced an intraabdominal bleed. The patient's current medical conditions include intraabdominal bleed post-paracentesis, respiratory failure, septic shock, DIC, hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status, HCV cirrhosis, DM2, seizure disorder, and depression/anxiety.

The patient has been through several interventions and treatments, including pigtail catheter placement and drainage of approximately 4 liters over 24 hours, extubation (self-extubated but tolerating well), completion of a 10-day course of Zosyn, and discontinuation of Vanco after a 7-day course. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104-132 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), creatinine (Cr), glucose, and liver enzymes such as ALT and AST. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges, with slightly low potassium levels. Imaging findings reveal an increase in perihilar haziness, fluid overload, moderate pleural effusions"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who has undergone a TIPS procedure. She was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient had a complicated paracentesis that led to an intraabdominal bleed. She also experienced respiratory failure secondary to acute mental status changes (AMS) and septic shock, which has since resolved. The patient also had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is now resolved. Additionally, she has hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently awaiting a liver transplant. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Re-bleeding from the intraabdominal bleed due to the complicated paracentesis.
2. Recurrence of respiratory failure due to AMS or other factors.
3. Development of septic shock due to infections or complications.
4. Re-occurrence of DIC.
5. Progression of hepatorenal syndrome.
6. Worsening of hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Complications related to the liver transplant procedure.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, coagulation profile, renal function, liver function, and mental status. Regular assessment and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent or manage any potential complications."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with Dr
   [**Last Name (STitle) 4239**]
s note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname 1112**] self extubated 48
   hrs ago and has remained safe on [**3-1**] lpm O2  and is requesting PO
   fluids. She is aware that she is in ICU at [**Hospital1 54**] but not much else. She
   is off Abx over past 24 hrs. all cultures have remained clean from
   repetitive belly taps. No need for further pRBC
   Exam notable for deep jaundice and mild asterixis. She has dry MM with
   pooling of oral secretions and weak gag.  Tm 97.6 BP 104/32  HR70 RR
   14-18 with sats of 96%  on 4 lpm .she has oozing wounds from belly
   taps.  Labs notable for WBC 8 K, HCT 34 , K+ 3.5 , Cr 3.2 ,bili of
   28.4. CXR with low lung volumes and small effusions.
   Agree with tube feeds today as she is still not safe from a swallowing
   perspective. We will have low threshold for TPN if tube feeds are not
   tolerated. She may need repeat paracentesis in 24-48 hrs and HD in the
   same time period. We will continue IV vanco for belly wounds and
   indwelling lines as potential septic sources. hopefully renal function
   will improve in a few days.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill but improving. Still needs ICU level care
   today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented to the hospital with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient underwent paracentesis but experienced an intraabdominal bleed. She is currently hemodynamically stable and has stable vital signs.

The patient's respiratory status has improved as she is no longer intubated and tolerating extubation well. However, she self-extubated and is on low-flow oxygen. There are concerns regarding her altered mental status, which is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy triggered by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient is restarted on lactulose and rifaximin, and her mental status has improved.

The patient also has renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and other complications. Her laboratory results show abnormalities including elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and deranged coagulation profile.

The patient's plan includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin, treating SBP and hepatorenal syndrome, and awaiting transplant. She will undergo hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow and will continue to be monitored closely in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, infections, bleeding due to coagulopathy, and respiratory"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient underwent paracentesis but experienced an intraabdominal bleed, which was managed with a pigtail catheter and drainage of approximately 4 liters over 24 hours.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, acute respiratory failure, hepatorenal syndrome, metabolic acidosis, altered mental status, and depression/anxiety.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate between 87-111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/54 to 145/71 mmHg, respiratory rate between 8-34 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 96%, and sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, while liver enzymes and creatinine levels are within normal range. The patient has a slightly elevated blood glucose level of 152 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and previous transplant surgery. She is currently awaiting a transplant.

The plan of care includes monitoring HCT and coagulation parameters every 8 hours,"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient's temperature has been fluctuating, with a high of 101 degrees Fahrenheit overnight. The patient's blood, urine, and ascites were sampled for culture. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and meropenem antibiotics. 

The patient's allergies include Zanaflex (Tizanidine Hcl), which causes hallucinations. The patient has previously taken piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) until 08:34 PM on 03/11/2146, vancomycin until 12:15 PM on 03/13/2146, and meropenem until 10:30 PM on 03/13/2146.

The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix) at 06:01 AM on 03/14/2146. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88-116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/49 to 157/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is currently 91.6 kg, with a height of 65 inches. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg, bladder pressure"

   24 Hour Events:
   patient spiked to 101 overnight. Sampled ascites (from drain, not new
   puncture), blood, urine. CXR this AM. Started vanco yesterday before
   spike, out of concern of open para sites; meropenem started overnight
   for empiric coverage of aspiration pna vs. GI source.
   Growing budding yeast from ascites - but will likely need new sterile
   paracentesis to be sure that that's not a contaminant.
   NGT in place, tolerate TF

   stable
   .
   # Fevers
 pt spiked to [**Age over 90 144**] yest and was started on
   Vancomycin/meropenem. Concern for infection for sources including line
   infection with HD cath and RIJ, open wound from previous para sites,
   aspiration PNA
 no clear new infiltrate on CXR and recurrent bacterial
   peritonitis. Pt also with yeast on sputum, urine cultures
   -          Continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) 430**] for now
   -          Will add caspofungin per liver recs
   -          Obtain cultures from all lines
   -          Repeat diagnostic paracentesis
   -          ID consult for antibiotic recommendations
   .
   # Intraabdominal Bleed s/p paracentesis
 HCT stable overnight, Vitals
   stable.
   - Transplant surgery following, appreciate input.
   - Trend HCT and coags Q8
   - Goal HCT 25, INR <2.0, Plt >30, Fibrinogen > 100
   - needs repeat para today, will perform US guided procedure with FFP
   and plts prior

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient underwent a paracentesis that was complicated by an intraabdominal bleed. He is currently hemodynamically stable and has shown improvement in his mental status after restarting lactulose and rifaximin.

The patient has been experiencing fevers and was started on vancomycin and meropenem. There is concern for infection from various sources, including a line infection with HD cath and RIJ, open wound from previous para sites, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient also has yeast present in sputum and urine cultures.

The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he is now self-extubated but tolerating it well. He has hepatorenal syndrome, which is likely triggered by the recent 11 L para on 02/24 with only 25 gm albumin. The patient is currently oliguric, and renal has been following. He was on CVVH and is now transitioned to HD.

The patient previously experienced septic shock, which resolved, and was likely due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Cultures continue to be negative. The patient completed a 7-day course of vancomycin and a 10-day course of Zosyn. He is currently being evaluated for further fever workup.

The patient also has a history of altered mental status,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, who was admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. He is now hemodynamically stable following a paracentesis complicated by an intraabdominal bleed. The patient has multiple comorbidities including DM2, seizure disorder, depression/anxiety, and HCV cirrhosis with decompensated liver disease, massive ascites, and encephalopathy. He is awaiting a liver transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraabdominal Bleed: The patient experienced an intraabdominal bleed following a paracentesis. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and coagulation parameters is necessary. Continued treatment with blood products and close follow-up of coagulation parameters are recommended.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure secondary to acute mental status changes, which has now resolved. However, there is a risk of recurrence, especially if the patient's mental status deteriorates again.

3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, likely triggered by recent paracentesis and massive ascites. Ongoing renal support with hemodialysis (HD) is necessary, and close monitoring of renal function is required.

4. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient had a likely episode of sepsis/septic shock, which has now resolved"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and ascites, admitted to the ICU for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- The patient developed fever overnight and was started on vancomycin for suspected open para sites. Meropenem was also started for empiric coverage of aspiration pneumonia versus GI source.
- Cultures were obtained from blood, urine, and ascites. Ascites culture showed budding yeast, which could potentially be a contaminant or indicate a fungal infection.
- The patient has a history of allergies to Zanaflex (Tizanidine Hcl) causing hallucinations.
- The patient is currently receiving multiple IV medications including pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications.
- Vital signs are as follows: Tmax of 101F, Tcurrent of 99.2F, HR of 88-116 bpm, BP of 134/57-157/69 mmHg, RR of 13-29 breaths/min, SpO2 of 96%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows CVP of 12 mmHg and bladder pressure of 17 mmHg.
- Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,100 mL and output of 1,972 mL.
- Respiratory support includes O2 delivery via nasal cannula and ABG results are pending.
- Physical examination findings are not assessed due to patient's altered mental status"

   24 Hour Events:
   patient spiked to 101 overnight. Sampled ascites (from drain, not new
   puncture), blood, urine. CXR this AM. Started vanco yesterday before
   spike, out of concern of open para sites; meropenem started overnight
   for empiric coverage of aspiration pna vs. GI source.
   Growing budding yeast from ascites - but will likely need new sterile
   paracentesis to be sure that that's not a contaminant.
   NGT in place, tolerate TF
s until the evening yesterday, then had high

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname 1112**] in a little more lethargic todayt
   [**Hospital1 54**].vanco started yesterday given open abd wounds and she now has
   yeast in ascitic fluid from that site. caspogungin also started today
   pending repeat paracentesis.
   Exam notable for deep jaundice and mild asterixis. She has dry MM with
   pooling of oral secretions and weak gag.  Tm 101.3 104/32  HR70 RR
   14-18 with sats of 96%  on 4 lpm .she has oozing wounds from belly
   taps.  she is oriented to name and place today.
   Labs notable for WBC 7.7K, hct of 33.7, K of 3.1 and creat of 3.5, BUN
   is 52 and Na of 149. CXR shows small lung volumes. She is 900 cc
   Positive overnight.
   While she has reamined extubated, she remains a high aspiration risk.
   She has concerns of ongoing sepsis ( fungal, SBP, apsiration as
   sources). I concur with plans to to tap belly with USG guidance by IR
   and start broad Abx including caspofungin. She will need HD today but
   will not take fluid off. Also free water to be repleted today. Tube
   feeds will be started slowly later today if residuals not high. TPN
   only to be started if fungal cultures are negative. ID input today
   given complexities and transplant situation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who presented with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. She was admitted from the operating room with a complication of intraabdominal bleed following a paracentesis. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, but has been experiencing fever spikes overnight. She has a history of open wounds, massive ascites, and varices secondary to decompensated cirrhosis. The patient is awaiting liver transplantation. She has been diagnosed with yeast in sputum and urine cultures, and there is a concern for infection sources including line infection, open wound infection, aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent bacterial peritonitis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fevers: The patient's temperature has been spiking, and she was started on vancomycin and meropenem. Concern for infection sources including line infection, open wound infection, aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent bacterial peritonitis.
   - Continue vancomycin/meropenem for now.
   - Add caspofungin per liver recommendations.
   - Obtain cultures from all lines.
   - Repeat diagnostic paracentesis.
   - ID consult for antibiotic recommendations.

2. Intraabdominal Bleed: The patient had a bleeding episode post-paracentesis, but her hemoglobin levels are stable overnight.
   - Trend HCT and coags Q8.
   - Goal HCT 25, INR <"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, CKD, and s/p TIPS, admitted to the ICU for encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient underwent a paracentesis that was complicated by an intraabdominal bleed. She is hemodynamically stable and currently receiving treatment for multiple potential sources of infection, including line infections, open wound infection, aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent bacterial peritonitis. The patient also has yeast on sputum and urine cultures. She has resolved respiratory failure and septic shock, and her altered mental status has improved. The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis with decompensation, varices, massive ascites, and is awaiting a liver transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including line infections, open wound infection, aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent bacterial peritonitis. She is currently being treated with antibiotics for these possible infections.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient is likely experiencing hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure that can occur in patients with advanced liver disease.
3. Liver failure: The patient's history of HCV cirrhosis indicates that she has significant liver damage, which can lead to liver failure.
4. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and it is important to monitor for any seizures during her"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, HRS, DM, pancytopenia, and resolved DIC from Klebsiella SBP. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications. 

1. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 111/34 to 142/73 mmHg. This indicates ongoing hypotension despite treatment.
2. Alteration in nutrition: The patient has hypernatremia and altered mental status, which may contribute to changes in their nutritional status.
3. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's urine output has been consistently low, with only 56 mL in the past 24 hours. Additionally, there are elevated levels of BUN and creatinine, indicating impaired renal function.
4. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): Although the patient previously had DIC, it seems to have resolved as there are no current signs of ongoing coagulation abnormalities.
5. Peritonitis, spontaneous bacterial (SBP): The patient's ascitic fluid culture grew yeast, indicating possible SBP.
6. Anemia, other: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, suggesting anemia.
7. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):"

1. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure has been consistently low, ranging from 111/34 mmHg to 142/73 mmHg. This indicates ongoing hypotension despite receiving treatment.
2. ALTERATION IN NUTRITION: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to limited oral intake and possible malabsorption caused by liver disease.
