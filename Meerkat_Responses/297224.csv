   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 56 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, possible HepB/C, and
   previous history of L3 fracture, who presented with back pain, alcohol
   intoxication, and elevated creatinine kinases.
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Most likely due to trauma as has stated that he might
   have jumped out of the window on admission to ED.  Has new L1/T12
   fracutures.  Non contrast CT without acute abnormalities.  CKs still
   trending up.
   - appreciate spine surgery consult
   - Aggressive IVF, target UOP [**12-8**] ml/kg per hour
   - Will trend CKs, frequent lytes
   - serum tox is positive for alcohol and utox was negative on admission
   .
   # EtOH Abuse: The patient has a significant history of EtOH abuse, with
   a recent drinking binge on the day prior to admission.  Alcohol level
   was 86 on [**1-31**] evening.  He has a history of withrawl seizures per
   patient.
   - patient is getting more frequent diazepam
   - SW C/S for substance abuse
   - Thiamine/Folate supplementation
   .
   # Back pain:  Has T12 and L1 small fractures on prelim MRI read.  CTA
   chest negative for PE/aortic dissection.  ? recent L3 fracture.
   - Continue Morphine q4h prn
   - appreciate spine surgery recs
   .
   # Elevated transaminases: The patient had elevated AST and ALT on
   admission. He reports binge drinking the night prior to admission as
   well as questionable history of HBV/HCV. New echogenic appearance of
   the liver consistent with fatty changes and suggestive of worsening
   liver disease.   Received Ceftriaxone on [**2-1**] morning for possible SBP,
   however given no ascites, fevers, evidence SBP, no need to continue
   - need liver follow up as out patient, however compliance will be an
   issue
   .
   # Leukocytosis: The patient had a leukocytosis on admission, which
   resolved with IV fluids.  ? response to
   rhabdo/dehydration/esophagitis.  Afebrile and CXR/UA not suspicious for
   infection.
   - F/U Blood Cx
   .
   #. Chest Burning: CTA and history consistent with esophagitis on CT.
   Has had negative CE yesterday morning (chest burning going on for
   approx one week per patient).
   - GI cocktail for sx relief
   - PPI for PPX
   - GI notified by floor team and may see patient today for possible
   scope
   .
   # Elevated lactate: The patient had a lactate, which was elevated to
   3.9 in the ED. This resolved with IVFs. There was a concern for
   thiamine deficiency, given the patient's history of alcoholism.
   - Continue thiamine supplements
   - F/U Thiamine level.
   .
   #. COPD: Patient has significant smoking history and reports h/o COPD
   for which he takes inhalers at home.  Patient desated to high 80s off
   of NC oxygen while sleeping.  CXR and PE-CTA without acute pathology to
   explain.

","The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse, possible HepB/C, and previous history of L3 fracture. He presented with back pain, alcohol intoxication, and elevated creatinine kinases. The patient's current condition includes rhabdomyolysis, EtOH abuse, back pain, elevated transaminases, leukocytosis, chest burning, elevated lactate, COPD, and fluid/electrolyte imbalance.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has been diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis, which is a serious condition that occurs when muscle breakdown releases a toxic substance into the bloodstream. Complications of rhabdomyolysis may include kidney damage, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiac arrhythmias.

2. EtOH abuse: The patient has a significant history of alcohol abuse, which increases the risk of various complications such as liver disease, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, malnutrition, and withdrawal symptoms.

3. Back pain and fractures: The patient has fractures in the T12 and L1 vertebrae, along with a history of a recent L3 fracture. These fractures could lead to further complications such as spinal cord compression, nerve damage, difficulty with mobility, and chronic pain.

4. Elevated transaminases: The patient's elevated AST and ALT levels indicate liver injury, which may be due to alcohol-related liver disease or other causes. Comp"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 56 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, possible HepB/C, and
   previous history of L3 fracture, who presented with back pain, alcohol
   intoxication, and elevated creatinine kinases.
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Patient has elevated CK, ua with blood but no RBCs,
   and elevated LFTs. Has h/o drinking and confusion.  No clear history of
   trauma but has stated that he jumped out of the window.  Has new L1/T12
   fracutures.
   - IV access EJ and PICC
   - will obtain trauma surgery consult
   - will obtain a NCHCT
   - Aggressive IVF, target UOP [**12-8**] ml/kg per hour
   - Will trend CKs, frequent lytes, lfts, uric acid
   - serum tox is positive for alcohol and utox was negative on admission
   - will check TSH (last in [**12-15**] was 0.4) and fT4
   - ? check cryoblobulin
   .
   # EtOH Abuse: The patient has a significant history of EtOH abuse, with
   a recent drinking binge on the day prior to admission.  Alcohol level
   was 86 on [**1-31**] evening.  He has a history of withrawl seizures per
   patient.
   - CIWA scale for possible withdrawal, currently written for diazepam
   10-20 mg oral for q2h and ativan
   - SW C/S for substance abuse
   - Thiamine/Folate supplementation

   # Back pain:  Has T12 and L1 small fractures on prelim MRI read.  CTA
   chest negative for PE/aortic dissection.  ? recent L3 fracture.
   - Continue Morphine q4h prn
   - will talk to trauma
   .
   # Elevated transaminases: The patient had elevated AST and ALT on
   admission. He reports binge drinking the night prior to admission as
   well as questionable history of HBV/HCV. New echogenic appearance of
   the liver consistent with fatty changes and suggestive of worsening
   liver disease.
   - received Ceftriaxone yesterday morning for possible SBP, however
   given no ascites, fevers, evidence SBP, no need to continue
   - Continue to trend AST/ALT.
   - need liver follow up as out patient, however compliance will be an
   issue
   .
   # Leukocytosis: The patient had a leukocytosis on admission, which
   resolved with IV fluids.  ? response to
   rhabdo/dehydration/esophagitis.  Afebrile and CXR/UA not suspicious for
   infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, possible Hepatitis B/C, and previous history of a lumbar fracture. He presented with back pain, alcohol intoxication, and elevated creatinine kinases. The patient's current condition includes rhabdomyolysis, EtOH abuse, back pain with fractures, elevated transaminases, leukocytosis, chest burning likely due to esophagitis, elevated lactate, COPD, respiratory alkalosis, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated CK levels, which indicates muscle breakdown. This can lead to kidney damage and potentially acute kidney injury.
2. EtOH abuse: The patient's significant history of alcohol abuse puts him at risk for withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens.
3. Back pain with fractures: The patient has T12 and L1 fractures, which can cause further complications such as spinal cord compression or nerve damage.
4. Elevated transaminases: The patient's elevated AST and ALT levels suggest liver injury, which can be associated with alcohol-related liver disease.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, although there are no clear signs of infection at present.
6. Esophagitis: The patient's symptoms of chest burning and the presence of esophagitis on CT scan suggest that he may"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with complaints of lower back pain. He was found to be intoxicated with an initial blood alcohol level of 110. An MRI scan revealed a compressed fracture of the T12 and L1 vertebrae, without any compromise to the spinal cord. The patient was briefly taken to the floor but was then transferred to the ICU for withdrawal management and rising creatine kinase (CK) levels. The CK levels have increased from 12,000 to 58,000 today.

The patient has received a total of 60 mg of oral Valium and 4 mg IV ativan in the last 24 hours and is currently drowsy with slight tachycardia and hypertension. A PICC line was placed for aggressive hydration to maintain urine output at 70 cc/h. The patient's vital signs are stable.

The patient's 24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, administration of a bolus with increased urine output, a negative head CT scan, agitation, Foley catheter placement, urinalysis, and consultation for spine fracture.

","The patient is a 40-year-old male admitted to the ICU with suspected alcohol withdrawal, rhabdomyolysis, transaminitis, and esophagitis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure of 133/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving IV fluids, heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and morphine sulfate for pain management. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of CK at 57,220, indicating possible muscle damage. The patient is also experiencing agitation and has a history of poor dentition. The patient has a Foley catheter in place and is being monitored for urine output. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Seizures: Due to alcohol withdrawal.
2. Respiratory failure: If the patient's respiratory rate increases or if there is a decrease in oxygen saturation.
3. Renal failure: Rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury.
4. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent clot formation.
6. Pressure ulcers: Immobility in the ICU can lead to skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
7. Malnutrition: Prolonged bed rest and decreased oral intake can lead to malnutrition.
8. Delirium: The patient is already agitated and at risk of developing delirium."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse and withdrawal, currently in the ICU for rhabdomyolysis, vertebral compression fracture, and EtOH withdrawal. He is experiencing worsening agitation and has received 60 mg of oral Valium and 4 mg IV Ativan in the last 24 hours. The patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are still rising, indicating ongoing muscle breakdown. He is being aggressively hydrated to maintain urine output at 70 cc/h and has a PICC line placed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure of 133/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but normal electrolytes and liver function tests. The patient has a history of poor dentition and a tender abdomen without rebound tenderness. The neurologic examination reveals an attentive but agitated patient. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK levels are still increasing, indicating ongoing muscle breakdown. This can lead to kidney damage due to the release of muscle cell contents into the bloodstream.
2. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of agitation and has received benzodiazepines to manage withdrawal symptoms. If left untreated, it can progress to severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens.
3. Vertebral Compression Fracture: The patient has a confirmed compression fracture at T12 and L1. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to further complications such as spinal cord compression or instability.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate liver injury. This could be related to alcohol abuse or muscle injury from rhabdomyolysis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male with multiple injuries and fractures from a motor vehicle accident. He was admitted to the ICU and received sedation with diazepam and haloperidol. His CK level decreased overnight, indicating improvement in muscle injury. However, the patient experienced two code purple episodes and was temporarily placed on leather restraints. Neurosurgery recommends a CT scan of the thoracic and lumbar spine to evaluate fractures, and the patient may require a TLSO brace afterward. The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently on various medications.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), current temperature of 36.7 C (98 F), heart rate of 139 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/38 mmHg to 183/118 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient has sinus tachycardia. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increase in total input and output, with a negative fluid balance.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate acid, lactic acid, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), lipase, and troponin-T. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's blood glucose levels have fluctuated throughout the day.

Plan:
The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition support, glycemic control,"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 56 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, possible HepB/C, and
   previous history of L3 fracture, who presented with back pain, alcohol
   intoxication, and elevated creatinine kinases.
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Most likely due to trauma as has stated that he might
   have jumped out of the window on admission to ED.  Non contrast CT
   without acute abnormalities.  CKs peaked on [**2-3**]^ PM.
   - Aggressive IVF, target UOP [**12-8**] ml/kg per hour
   - Will trend CKs, frequent lytes
   - serum tox is positive for alcohol and utox was negative on admission
   .
   # EtOH Abuse: The patient has a significant history of EtOH abuse, with
   a recent drinking binge on the day prior to admission.  Alcohol level
   was 86 on [**1-31**] evening.  He has a history of withrawl seizures per
   patient.
   - patient is getting more frequent diazepam
   - he will also get standing haldol for agitation secondary to
   behavioural issues
   - SW C/S for substance abuse once patient is able to cooperate
   - Thiamine/Folate supplementation
   .
   # Back pain:  Has T12 and L1 small fractures on prelim MRI read.  CTA
   chest negative for PE/aortic dissection.   Neurosurgery thinks that the
   MRI L spine abnormalities are probable DJD or older fracuture.  No need
   for brace.
   - Continue Morphine q4h prn
   .
   # Elevated transaminases: The patient had elevated AST and ALT on
   admission. He reports binge drinking the night prior to admission as
   well as questionable history of HBV/HCV. New echogenic appearance of
   the liver consistent with fatty changes and suggestive of worsening
   liver disease.   Received Ceftriaxone on [**2-1**] morning for possible SBP,
   however given no ascites, fevers, evidence SBP, no need to continue
   - need liver follow up as out patient, however compliance will be an
   issue
   .
   #. Chest Burning: CTA and history consistent with esophagitis on CT
   - GI cocktail for sx relief
   - PPI for PPX
   - GI notified by floor team however has not seen the patient yet, may
   need further workup once his agitation/withdrawl is under control
   .
   # Elevated lactate: The patient had a lactate, which was elevated to
   3.9 in the ED. This resolved with IVFs. There was a concern for
   thiamine deficiency, given the patient's history of alcoholism.
   - Continue thiamine supplements
   - F/U Thiamine level.
   .
   #. COPD: Patient has significant smoking history and reports h/o COPD
   for which he takes inhalers at home.  Patient desated to high 80s off
   of NC oxygen while sleeping.  CXR and PE-CTA without acute pathology to
   explain.
   - Nebs around the clock
   - Follow O2 sats
   .
   # FEN: Regular low Na diet. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin SQ, PPI
   .
   # Access: PICC

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse and withdrawal who was found intoxicated and complaining of lower back pain. The initial EtOH level was 110, and an MRI of the spine revealed a complicated fracture of T12 and L1 without cord compromise. The patient experienced a brief episode of going to the floor but was transferred to the ICU for increased withdrawal symptoms and rising creatine kinase (CK) levels from 12,000 to 52,000. The patient is currently receiving 40-60 mg IV valium as needed, and there have been two code purples for agitation and combative behavior. The patient is now on standing haloperidol in four-point restraints. A PICC line has been placed for aggressive hydration to maintain urine output at 70 cc/h. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Rhabdomyolysis: The CK levels are now decreasing.
   - Increase IV fluids to 200/h.
   - Continue trending CK levels.
   - Follow up with spine recommendations.
2. Alcohol withdrawal:
   - Start valium 40 mg orally four times a day.
   - Continue IV valium as per CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment).
   - Continue sitter.
   - Continue haloperidol 10 mg IV three times a day, follow QTc.
   - Added clonidine 0.1 mg three times a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal. He was found intoxicated with an initial EtOH level of 110 and later diagnosed with a spinal compression fracture at T12 and L1 without cord compromise. The patient experienced a brief episode of losing consciousness and was subsequently transferred to the ICU for increased withdrawal symptoms and rising creatine kinase (CK) levels from 12,000 to 52,000. 

The patient received 40-60 mg IV Valium as needed and experienced two episodes of agitation and combative behavior, requiring code purples. He was sedated with 330 mg IV Valium and 30 mg IV Haloperidol and now has a sitter assigned. The CK levels are trending down, and the patient is making good urine output. A follow-up appointment with the spine consultant determined that no brace is needed.

The patient has no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was given on [date]. The patient is currently receiving Haloperidol (Haldol) at [dosage] and Diazepam (Valium) at [dosage]. Other medications include [list of medications].

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 717**] is a 56 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, HepB/C, and previous
   history of L3 fracture, who presented with back pain, alcohol
   intoxication, and rhabdomyolysis.
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Most likely due to trauma as has stated that he might
   have jumped out of the window on admission to ED, but also consider
   alcohol-induced coma vs. seizure activity.  Non contrast CT without
   acute abnormalities.  CKs peaked at  on [**2-3**]^, now trending down.  Home
   medication list reviewed, without identification of likely inciting
   cause.
   - Aggressive IVF, target UOP [**12-8**] ml/kg per hour
   - Will trend CKs, frequent lytes
   - serum tox is positive for alcohol and utox was negative on admission
   .
   # EtOH Abuse: The patient has a significant history of EtOH abuse, with
   a recent drinking binge on the day prior to admission.  Alcohol level
   was 86 on [**1-31**] evening.  He has a history of withdrawal seizures per
   patient.
   - change diazepam to PRN
   - decrease standing haldol dose
   - Clonidine for withdrawal symptoms
   - SW C/S for substance abuse once patient is able to cooperate
   - MVI/ thiamine/Folate supplementation
   .
   # Back pain:  Has T12 and L1 small fractures on prelim MRI read,
   possibly associated with presumed traumatic injury.  Neurosurgery was
   consulted and, based upon likelihood that these MRI L spine
   abnormalities are probable DJD or older fracuture, recommended no
   further imaging and no indication for TLSO.
   - minimize narcotics as able
   - Lidoderm to low back
   - Inhaled calcitonin as off-label use for pain secondary to vertebral
   compression fractures
   .
   # Elevated transaminases: The patient had elevated AST and ALT on
   admission with AST>ALT.  AST may be elevated secondary to muscle
   breakdown in the setting of rhabdomyolysis. New echogenic appearance of
   the liver consistent with fatty changes and suggestive of worsening
   liver disease.   Serologies positive for hepatitis B & C
   co-infection.
   - Schedule for outpatient Liver f/u
   - Trend LFT
   .
   #. Chest Burning:  CTA chest negative for PE.  Suspect esophagitis.
   - GI cocktail for sx relief
   - Continue home Prilosec
   .
   #. COPD: Patient has significant smoking history and reports h/o COPD
   for which he takes inhalers at home.
   - Continue Advair, Ipratropium, Albuterol PRN
   - Follow O2 sats
   - Nicotine TD PRN
   # Psychiatric illness:  Continue home regimen of Seroquel, Fluvoxamine
   .
   # FEN: Regular low Na diet. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin SQ, PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hepatitis B and C, and previous fractures. He presented with back pain, alcohol intoxication, and rhabdomyolysis. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, scattered wheezes, and somnolence. His laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), liver enzymes, and lactic acid. The patient is being treated with aggressive intravenous fluid administration, pain management, and monitoring of electrolytes. Imaging studies reveal T12 and L1 fractures, but no acute abnormalities on non-contrast CT scan. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK levels are elevated, indicating ongoing muscle breakdown. This condition can lead to kidney damage and acute kidney injury.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: Given the patient's significant history of alcohol abuse and recent drinking binge, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which may include seizures and delirium tremens.
3. Hepatitis B and C: The patient has positive serologies for hepatitis B and C, suggesting chronic liver disease. This puts him at risk for complications such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
4. Vertebral fractures: The patient has fractures in the T12 and L1 vertebrae, which can lead to chronic pain, neurological deficits, and potential spinal cord compression.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 56 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, possible HepB/C, and
   previous history of L3 fracture, who presented with back pain, alcohol
   intoxication, and elevated creatinine kinases.
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Most likely due to trauma as has stated that he might
   have jumped out of the window on admission to ED.  Non contrast CT
   without acute abnormalities.  CKs peaked on [**2-3**]^ PM.
   - Aggressive IVF, target UOP [**12-8**] ml/kg per hour
   - Will trend CKs, frequent lytes
   - serum tox is positive for alcohol and utox was negative on admission
   .
   # EtOH Abuse: The patient has a significant history of EtOH abuse, with
   a recent drinking binge on the day prior to admission.  Alcohol level
   was 86 on [**1-31**] evening.  He has a history of withrawl seizures per
   patient.
   - patient is getting more frequent diazepam
   - he will also get standing haldol for agitation secondary to
   behavioural issues
   - SW C/S for substance abuse once patient is able to cooperate
   - Thiamine/Folate supplementation
   .
   # Back pain:  Has T12 and L1 small fractures on prelim MRI read.  CTA
   chest negative for PE/aortic dissection.   Neurosurgery thinks that the
   MRI L spine abnormalities are probable DJD or older fracuture.  No need
   for brace.
   - Continue Morphine q4h prn
   .
   # Elevated transaminases: The patient had elevated AST and ALT on
   admission. He reports binge drinking the night prior to admission as
   well as questionable history of HBV/HCV. New echogenic appearance of
   the liver consistent with fatty changes and suggestive of worsening
   liver disease.   Received Ceftriaxone on [**2-1**] morning for possible SBP,
   however given no ascites, fevers, evidence SBP, no need to continue
   - need liver follow up as out patient, however compliance will be an
   issue
   .
   #. Chest Burning: CTA and history consistent with esophagitis on CT
   - GI cocktail for sx relief
   - PPI for PPX
   - GI notified by floor team however has not seen the patient yet, may
   need further workup once his agitation/withdrawl is under control
   .
   # Elevated lactate: The patient had a lactate, which was elevated to
   3.9 in the ED. This resolved with IVFs. There was a concern for
   thiamine deficiency, given the patient's history of alcoholism.
   - Continue thiamine supplements
   - F/U Thiamine level.
   .
   #. COPD: Patient has significant smoking history and reports h/o COPD
   for which he takes inhalers at home.  Patient desated to high 80s off
   of NC oxygen while sleeping.  CXR and PE-CTA without acute pathology to
   explain.
   - Nebs around the clock
   - Follow O2 sats
   .
   # FEN: Regular low Na diet. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin SQ, PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse and possible Hepatitis B and C. He presented with back pain, alcohol intoxication, and elevated creatinine kinases. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient likely developed rhabdomyolysis due to trauma. This is supported by his statement that he might have jumped out of a window on admission to the emergency department. Non-contrast CT scan did not show any acute abnormalities, and CK levels peaked at [**2-3**]^ PM.

2. EtOH Abuse: The patient has a significant history of alcohol abuse and was involved in a recent drinking binge before admission. His alcohol level was 86 on [**1-31**] evening. He also has a history of withdrawal seizures.

3. Back pain: The patient has T12 and L1 small fractures on preliminary MRI read. CTA chest negative for PE/aortic dissection. Neurosurgery believes that the MRI L spine abnormalities are probable degenerative joint disease or older fracture. No need for brace.

4. Elevated transaminases: The patient had elevated AST and ALT on admission. He reports binge drinking the night prior to admission, as well as a questionable history of HBV/HCV. New echogenic appearance of the liver consistent with fatty changes and suggestive of worsening liver disease. He received Ceftria"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal, anxiety, back pain with possible complications from a fall, COPD, esophagitis, and renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119-132 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, creatinine levels, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes such as ALT and AST. The patient's potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis, which has improved, and alcohol withdrawal. The treatment plan includes adjusting IV fluids, reducing valium dosage, restarting home psychiatric medications, and administering analgesics for back pain. The patient is also on medications for anxiety, COPD, and esophagitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening of rhabdomyolysis leading to kidney injury or failure, development of delirium tremens in the setting of alcohol withdrawal, exacerbation of COPD, and further complications related to esophagitis.

   following modifications/emphasis:
   56 year old alcoholic who presented with back pain and found to have
   minimal compression fractures, rhabdo, and ultimately alcohol
   withdrawal.  He is now improving both in terms of rhabdo and withdrawal
   and back pain is improved as well.

   2)       Compression fractures of the back
   3)       Alcohol Withdrawal
   Plan:
   - will begin to decrease IVFs as CPK much improved
   - begin to wean off high doses of benzos for alcohol withdrawal as his
   home psych medications are added as well
   - If level of agitation improves, will consider transfer back to the

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with lower back pain and was found intoxicated. The initial EtOH level was 110, and an MRI of the spine showed compression fractures of T12 and L1 without cord compromise. The patient experienced a brief episode of falling but was transferred to the ICU for increased withdrawal and rising creatine kinase (CK) levels from 12,000 to 52,000. He is currently receiving 40-60 mg IV Valium as needed and has been placed on standing haloperidol in four-point restraints due to agitation. A PICC line has been placed for aggressive hydration to maintain urine output at least 70 cc/h.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
- Heart rate: 107 bpm (range: 96-132 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 132/93 mmHg (range: 100-172/68-103 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (range: 13-23 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 94%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's lab results show:

The patient experienced a brief episode of floor time but was transferred to the ICU for increased withdrawal symptoms and rising CK levels from 12,000 to 52,000.

A PICC line has been placed for aggressive hydration to maintain urine output at least 70cc/h. Vital signs are relatively stable, but the patient's overall condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK level was initially very high, indicating severe muscle breakdown. While it has improved significantly, there is still a risk of further complications such as kidney damage or cardiac issues.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal puts him at risk for severe withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens, seizures, and potential complications like Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
3. Complicated Fracture: The patient has a complex fracture of T12 and L1. This can lead to additional complications such as pneumonia, deep"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse and withdrawal who was found intoxicated with complaints of lower back pain. The patient's initial EtOH level was 110, and an MRI revealed a complicated fracture of T12 and L1 without cord compromise. The patient experienced a brief episode on the floor but was transferred to the ICU for increased withdrawal symptoms and rising creatine kinase levels from 12,000 to 52,000. The patient is currently receiving 40-60 mg IV valium as needed and has been placed on standing haloperidol in four-point restraints after a code purple incident where the patient hit his nurse. A PICC line has been placed for aggressive hydration to maintain urine output at least 70 cc/h. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK levels were initially very high at 12,000 but have greatly improved. However, there is still a risk of further complications due to trauma from the fall.

2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and withdrawal symptoms, and he is currently being treated with valium for this condition. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of delirium tremens or seizures.

3. Back Pain: The patient has a complicated fracture of T12 and L1"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 717**] is a 56 yo man with h/o EtOH abuse, HepB/C, and previous
   history of L3 fracture, who presented with back pain, alcohol
   intoxication, and rhabdomyolysis.
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Most likely due to trauma as has stated that he might
   have jumped out of the window on admission to ED, but also consider
   alcohol-induced coma vs. seizure activity.  Non contrast CT without
   acute abnormalities.  CKs peaked at  on [**2-3**]^, now trending down.  Home
   medication list reviewed, without identification of likely inciting
   cause.
   - Aggressive IVF, target UOP [**12-8**] ml/kg per hour
   - Will trend CKs, frequent lytes
   - serum tox is positive for alcohol and utox was negative on admission
   .
   # EtOH Abuse: The patient has a significant history of EtOH abuse, with
   a recent drinking binge on the day prior to admission.  Alcohol level
   was 86 on [**1-31**] evening.  He has a history of withdrawal seizures per
   patient.
   - change diazepam to PRN
   - decrease standing haldol dose
   - Clonidine for withdrawal symptoms
   - SW C/S for substance abuse once patient is able to cooperate
   - MVI/ thiamine/Folate supplementation
   .
   # Back pain:  Has T12 and L1 small fractures on prelim MRI read,
   possibly associated with presumed traumatic injury.  Neurosurgery was
   consulted and, based upon likelihood that these MRI L spine
   abnormalities are probable DJD or older fracuture, recommended no
   further imaging and no indication for TLSO.
   - minimize narcotics as able
   - Lidoderm to low back
   - Inhaled calcitonin as off-label use for pain secondary to vertebral
   compression fractures
   .
   # Elevated transaminases: The patient had elevated AST and ALT on
   admission with AST>ALT.  AST may be elevated secondary to muscle
   breakdown in the setting of rhabdomyolysis. New echogenic appearance of
   the liver consistent with fatty changes and suggestive of worsening
   liver disease.   Serologies positive for hepatitis B & C
   co-infection.
   - Schedule for outpatient Liver f/u
   - Trend LFT
   .
   #. Chest Burning:  CTA chest negative for PE.  Suspect esophagitis.
   - GI cocktail for sx relief
   - Continue home Prilosec
   .
   #. COPD: Patient has significant smoking history and reports h/o COPD
   for which he takes inhalers at home.
   - Continue Advair, Ipratropium, Albuterol PRN
   - Follow O2 sats
   - Nicotine TD PRN
   # Psychiatric illness:  Continue home regimen of Seroquel, Fluvoxamine
   .
   # FEN: Regular low Na diet. Replete lytes prn.
   .
   # PPx: Heparin SQ, PPI
   .
   # Access: Right arm PICC, placed [**2-2**].

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of ethanol abuse, hepatitis B and C, and previous compression fractures.
- He presented with back pain, alcohol intoxication, and rhabdomyolysis.
- The patient's current condition includes elevated transaminases, fatty changes in the liver, and a positive serology for hepatitis B & C co-infection.
- Other ongoing concerns include COPD, psychiatric illness, potential esophagitis, and low back pain secondary to compression fractures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's history of trauma or alcohol-induced coma/seizure activity may have contributed to the development of rhabdomyolysis. Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and frequent monitoring of electrolytes are important for managing this condition.

2. EtOH Abuse: The patient has a significant history of ethanol abuse, which increases the risk of withdrawal symptoms. The change in diazepam to PRN and decreasing the standing dose of haloperidol are appropriate measures to prevent withdrawal symptoms.

3. Elevated Transaminases: The patient's elevated AST and ALT may be secondary to muscle breakdown in rhabdomyolysis or worsening liver disease. Trending liver function tests and scheduling outpatient liver follow-up are necessary for monitoring liver function.

4. Back Pain: The patient has T12 and L1 small fractures on preliminary MRI read, possibly associated with presumed traumatic injury. Min"
