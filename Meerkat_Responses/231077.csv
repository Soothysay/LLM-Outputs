","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus type 2. She presented with dyspnea and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being monitored. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a supratherapeutic prothrombin time (PTT) due to heparin therapy. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled with metoprolol. She has hypernatremia, leukocytosis, COPD, CAD/CHF, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, dysphagia, and dementia. She is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient already has a confirmed diagnosis of PE. The main concern is the potential for further clot formation or deterioration of the existing clots, leading to worsening respiratory distress or even sudden death.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is currently in atrial flutter, but it was previously in atrial fibrillation. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias leading to hemodynamic instability.

3. Hypernatrem"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with dyspnea and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). She also has evidence of acute-on-chronic PE, as shown on the CT angiography (CTA) scan. Other findings on the CTA include emphysema with ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe, suggestive of advanced respiratory bronchiolitis, and a 6-mm nodule in the left lower lobe. There is also cardiomegaly with a pacemaker device in place.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/73 to 154/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Her temperature is slightly elevated at 37.1 degrees Celsius. She has an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.8-10.2 K/uL, slightly low platelet count (Plt) of 300-302 K/uL, and normal hemoglobin (Hct) of 41.4-40.9%. Her creatinine (Cr) level is within normal range at 0.6-0.4 mg/dL, and troponin T is negative at 0.01 ng/mL. Other lab values such as potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg++), calcium (Ca++), and phosphorus (PO4) are within normal limits.

The patient has been started on heparin for anticoagulation due to the presence of a large clot burden. It is planned to transition her to coumadin. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be considered if she is unable to continue anticoagulation as an outpatient. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled with digoxin, and she will restart her home dose of metoprolol. She will also continue taking prednisone for COPD, fluticasone, albuterol, and atrovent as part of her outpatient regimen.

The patient has hypernatremia, which has resolved with IV fluid repletion. Leukocytosis is present but likely reactive in the setting of PE, and no obvious source"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with dyspnea and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). She has been admitted to the ICU for monitoring and treatment. 

24-hour events:
- The patient was started on heparin due to the PE.
- The patient's PTT was supratherapeutic, so heparin was held.
- The patient was started on digoxin for rate control of atrial fibrillation.
- The patient had an ultrasound done.
- The patient had a CT angiography (CTA) of the chest that showed multiple pulmonary emboli, including acute-on-chronic emboli.
- The patient had a left popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), for which a lower extremity venous duplex (LENI) was performed.
- The patient's vital signs were stable overnight.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pulmonary Embolism - The patient is at high risk for immobility and recent hospitalization. She is not on long-term prophylaxis. A lower extremity venous duplex (LENI) confirmed a right lower extremity DVT. The CTA showed evidence of acute and chronic PE.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dementia, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with dyspnea and was found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/59 mmHg to 150/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion for anticoagulation due to the large clot burden. The healthcare team is considering an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter if anticoagulation cannot be continued as an outpatient. A lower extremity ultrasound (LE US) has been ordered for risk assessment.

For atrial fibrillation, the patient is being treated with intravenous metoprolol for rate control and will resume her oral regimen of lopressor 50mg. She was previously not on coumadin due to fall risk.

Hypernatremia is present, with a sodium level of 149 on presentation. The total body is overloaded but likely intravascularly dry. D5W will be used to replete the sodium levels.

Leukocytosis is observed, with a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/u"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dementia, and dysphagia. She was admitted to the ICU due to dyspnea and found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently on therapeutic heparin and will continue anticoagulation therapy. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is being considered if unable to continue anticoagulation as an outpatient. The patient also presented with atrial fibrillation (AF), which is being controlled with IV metoprolol. She has hypernatremia, likely due to total body overload, and will be repleted with D5W. There is leukocytosis, but no obvious source of infection, and it may be reactive in the setting of PE. The patient's COPD, CAD/CHF, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, dysphagia, and dementia will be managed according to their respective plans. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is being provided. The patient's glycemic control and nutrition will be monitored. The patient's peripheral lines and code status are noted. Disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of immobility and recent hospitalization"

He presented to the ICU with symptoms of acute pulmonary embolism. Upon admission, the patient was found to have a rapid heart rate and low blood pressure. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with fluctuating vital signs and an inability to wean off the ventilator. Despite efforts to stabilize, the patient remains critically ill with ongoing hemodynamic instability and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary hypertension: Due to the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute pulmonary embolism (PE), there is a risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, which can further compromise lung function and cardiac output.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and history of PE, there is a high risk for the development of DVT in the lower extremities. This can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism or post-thrombotic syndrome.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and the current presentation suggests that he may still be experiencing this arrhythmia. It is important to monitor for any changes in heart rhythm and manage accordingly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and inability to wean"
