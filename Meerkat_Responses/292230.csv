","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He presents with hyponatremia and acute urinary retention. The patient's sodium levels are being closely monitored and will be slowly increased through free water restriction. His altered mental status is assessed, with normal TSH, B12, and folate levels, indicating no clear cause for cognitive difficulty. The patient denies any history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) but reports prior episodes of urinary retention. Physical examination reveals an enlarged prostate without tenderness, and there is no evidence of fecal incontinence or saddle anesthesia. The patient is currently not experiencing any signs of withdrawal from alcohol use. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels require careful monitoring and management to prevent complications such as seizures or neurological damage.
2. Altered Mental Status: The underlying cause of the patient's altered mental status needs further investigation to ensure appropriate management and prevent potential complications related to cognitive impairment.
3. Acute Urinary Retention: The patient's urinary retention requires prompt treatment to relieve symptoms and prevent complications such as urinary tract infections or kidney damage.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count should be monitored to identify any potential complications associated with bleeding or clotting disorders.
5. Hypertension: Although the patient is currently normot"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He presents with hyponatremia and acute urinary retention.

The patient's sodium levels have been decreasing despite being on D5W (5% dextrose in water) at a rate of 250 cc/hr, then decreased to 125 cc/hr, and finally stopped after the sodium level dropped to 119. The patient is advised to restrict fluids and check sodium levels every 4-6 hours to slowly increase it.

The patient also has altered mental status, which is attributed to hyponatremia and possibly alcohol-related cognitive difficulties. His TSH, B12, and folate levels are normal. The patient is resistant to discontinuing alcohol use.

The patient has been diagnosed with urinary retention, likely secondary to an enlarged prostate. Spontaneous voiding trial will be attempted once his sodium levels are under control, and he will be followed up with urology.

There is a suspicion of urinary tract infection (UTI) due to urinary retention, and the patient has been started on ciprofloxacin for 7 days. His platelet count is low, which is likely due to alcohol use. He will be monitored for thrombocytopenia.

The patient has a history of hypertension, but his blood pressure is currently normal. His antihypertensive medication, diltiaz"

   iatrogenic hyponatremia to prevent CPML was confused by prior
   administration of ddavp and he overshot with nadir Na 119 last night.
   Stopped all free water at 121.
   Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (NI) 420**] outside hospitals but was unable to find records of
   previous admissions for urologic issues, and pt's wife stated that he
   had no known h/o of similar issues except one episode of urinary
   retention that resolved spontaneously in the recnt past.
   Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] also did prostate exam and found enlarged, boggy prostate,
   nontender.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of hyponatremia. He presents with polydypsia and urinary retention. The patient has been started on ciprofloxacin for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). His sodium levels were initially at 134, and he was given free water to prevent cerebral edema due to cautious iatrogenic hyponatremia. However, the patient's sodium levels dropped to 119 last night, and all free water has been stopped.

The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/52 to 141/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows balanced fluid intake and output.

Physical examination reveals an overweight and obese patient with a boggy, non-tender prostate on digital rectal examination. Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's hyponatremia has been addressed by stopping the dextrose infusion and rechecking sodium levels every six hours."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. He presents with hyponatremia and altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing urinary retention and has a history of increased intake of beer. His sodium levels are being corrected through free water restriction. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, which is likely secondary to alcohol abuse. He is currently normotensive and his antihypertensive medication has been adjusted. His diabetes medication has been restarted, and he is on a heart-healthy diabetic diet. Prophylactic measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis prevention and bowel regimen. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently on IV fluids for sodium correction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels can lead to various complications such as seizures, coma, and even death if not corrected properly.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may progress to confusion, hallucinations, or loss of consciousness if left untreated.
3. Urinary Retention: The patient's inability to void properly can lead to urinary tract infections, bladder distension, and kidney damage if not addressed.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding and bruising.
5. Hypertension: If not properly managed, the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old man with dementia who was admitted with hyponatremia caused by polydipsia and urinary retention. His blood cultures were taken and he received antibiotics for a suspected Staphylococcus infection. The patient has been on free water restriction, which has helped in resolving his hyponatremia. He also had a Foley catheter inserted due to urinary retention and will be followed up with the urology service as an outpatient. The patient's other medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/49 to 131/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -2,370 mL. The patient's extremities are warm and he has purposeful movement with normal bowel sounds. Neurological examination reveals that he is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. 

Laboratory results show a sodium level of 22 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.8 K/uL, blood glucose level of 108 mg/dL, white blood cell count of 3.3 K/uL, hematocrit of 27.8%, platelet count of 92 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of <0.01 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's initial presentation was hyponatremia, which has been resolved with free water restriction. However, there is a risk of electrolyte imbalances developing due to ongoing fluid management and potential medication effects.
2. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient was given antibiotics for a suspected Staphylococcus infection. There is a possibility of developing a urinary tract infection due to the Foley catheter placement.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, likely secondary to alcoholism. This condition can lead to reduced production of blood cells and increase the risk of infection and bleeding.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylaxis measures are in place, but close monitoring for signs of DVT is necessary.
5. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and the use of corticosteroids. Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding is important.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is in the ICU, there is a risk of developing VAP if mechanical ventilation is required. Proper oral hygiene, elevation of the head of bed, and regular chest X"
