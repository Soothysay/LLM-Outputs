   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 79 year old female with past medical history of
   hypertension and depression who presented with several days of chest
   pain, found to have a NSTEMI, and now s/p cath with 3VD, transferred to
   CCU for closer monitoring and BP control.
   .
   # Chest pain/CORONARIES: Now s/p cath which revealed 3VD. Will likely
   need bypass surgery. Nitro gtt if needed for further chest pain.
   - continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
   - CT surgery c/s to evaluate for need for bypass
   - continue ASA, hold plavix given need for upcoming bypass surgery,
   beta-blocker, integrillin drip until the AM, statin
   - Titrate nitroglycerin drip to pain free and adequate BP control
   - serial EKGs
   .
   # PUMP:
   - continue BB and [**Last Name (un) 284**], TTE in AM to assess EF
   .
   # RHYTHM: Mostly sinus but one episode of VT lasting 3min.  VT likely
   reactive to ongoing ischemia.
   - If VT returns, would consider lidocaine if stable BP.  Cardiovert of
   hypotension
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Depression: Continue Wellbutrin.
   - consider social work c/s if needed
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient has history of hypertension, per report has
   been quite labile, also likely [**2-23**] cardiac dysfunction. Renal U/S was
   negative for renal artery stenosis.
   - Continue diovan and BB
   - nitro gtt as needed, goal SBP 120 to 150 and DBP > 60 for adequate
   coronary perfusion

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and depression. She presented with chest pain and was found to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She underwent cardiac catheterization and was diagnosed with triple vessel disease (3VD). The patient is currently in the cardiac care unit (CCU) for closer monitoring and blood pressure control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chest pain/CORONARIES: The patient may require coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery due to the 3VD. Nitroglycerin will be titrated to pain-free and adequate blood pressure control. Cardiac enzymes will continue to be monitored, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest may be done to evaluate for the need of bypass surgery.

2. PUMP: The patient's heart function will be assessed using a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to evaluate the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Beta-blockers will be continued, and any abnormal heart rhythms, such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), will be closely monitored. If VT recurs, lidocaine may be considered if the patient's blood pressure remains stable. Cardioversion may be performed if the patient becomes hypotensive.

3. RHYTHM: The patient experienced one episode of VT, which was likely reactive to ongoing ischemia. If VT returns,"

The patient is currently in the coronary care unit (CCU) for closer monitoring and blood pressure control.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/58 to 144/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs, and clear lung sounds bilaterally.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, platelet count of 261 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 24 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 1.75 ng/mL. The electrocardiogram (EKG) shows sinus rhythm.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring of cardiac enzymes, consideration"

   Chief Complaint: Patient is a 79 year old female with past medical
   history of hypertension and depression who presented with several days
   of chest pain, found to have a NSTEMI, and now s/p cath with 3VD,
   transferred to CCU for closer monitoring and BP control
   24 Hour Events:
   Several runs of self terminated, asymptomatic slow VT. No EKG obtained.
   ECHO - The left atrium is elongated. There is symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and
   tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
   dysfunction. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest
   or with Valsalva. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
   is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension and depression who presented with chest pain, was found to have a NSTEMI, and underwent cardiac catheterization revealing triple vessel disease (3VD). She is currently in the CCU for closer monitoring and blood pressure control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of NSTEMI and 3VD, there is a risk of further cardiac events such as recurrent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, heart failure, arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia), or even cardiogenic shock.
2. Bleeding Complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy with heparin and dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and integrillin. This increases the risk of bleeding complications such as epistaxis (which has already occurred), gastrointestinal bleeding, or intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Infection: The patient is at an increased risk of developing infections due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored as she is on medications like vancomycin and possibly other nephrotoxic drugs. Acute kidney injury or worsening renal function could occur.
5. Thromboembolic Events: Despite anticoagulation, the patient may still be at risk for thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emb"
