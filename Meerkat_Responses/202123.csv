","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), confirmed during this admission, and an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery to revascularize due to three-vessel disease. The patient has been experiencing recurrent chest pain, but it has been controlled with nitroglycerin. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 106/63 mmHg, heart rate of 59 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and hepatojugular reflux. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and glucose levels. She has a history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure with an EF of 25% at the onset of symptoms, but a more recent echo showed an EF of 40%. The patient's social stressors include recently losing her mother to cancer and losing her job, but she denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation or depression. She is NPO (nothing by mouth) for the CABG surgery today. The patient is on various medications, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and heparin. Her code status is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) who is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 59 beats per minute and blood pressure within normal range. Oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient is receiving intravenous heparin and nitroglycerin.

The patient's physical examination reveals an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and hepatomegaly with hepatojugular reflux. No murmurs or gallops are heard, and the lungs are clear. The abdominal examination shows soft and non-tender organs. Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab values, including glucose, electrolytes, and renal function tests, are within normal range.

The patient has a history of recurrent chest pain and EKG changes, which are concerning for further ischemia. Chest pain has been controlled with nitroglycerin, and the patient is currently pain-free. The plan is to continue nitroglycerin infusion and monitor the patient closely in the CCU before proceeding with CABG surgery.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include further myocardial ischemia or infarction due to inadequate revascularization, bleeding complications from anticoagulation therapy, infection at the surgical site, and possible"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), confirmed during this admission. She has an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% and was transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for monitoring of recurrent chest pain. The patient experienced further ischemia and chest pain, which has been controlled with nitroglycerin. The plan is to proceed with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and recurrent chest pain suggests a risk for further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving IV heparin for DVT prophylaxis, which carries a risk of bleeding.
3. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's EF of 40% and crackles on examination, there is a potential for pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates potential renal impairment, which may be exacerbated by the use of certain medications or procedures.
5. Infection complications: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged ICU stay.
6. Psychological stressors: The patient has recently experienced significant life stressors, including the loss of her mother and job, which could impact her"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yr old F with a history of 3V CAD, confirmed on C. cath during this
   admission, EF of 40%, who is transferred to CCU for monitoring of
   recurrent chest pain.

   # CORONARIES: Patient with 3 vessel disease on cath. Previously found
   to be the case in [**2174**], but had been treated medically. On the floor,
   patient with recurrent chest pain and EKG changes, concerning for
   further ischemia. Chest pain has been controlled on nitro gtt. Patient
   to CCU for monitoring; plan for CABG today.
   - continue nitro gtt
   - if has further CP, would uptitrate nitro, and contact [**Name2 (NI) 9339**] and
   attending for potential balloon pump vs. urgent CABG
   - appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   - continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 119**], ACE-i, simvastatin

   is much improved compared to day of admission at OSH, but still with
   elevated JVP (no crackles on my exam this morning).
   -Goal -500cc negative daily; PRN lasix to achieve this goal, with close

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), confirmed during this admission. She has an ejection fraction (EF) of 40% and is being transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU) for monitoring of recurrent chest pain. The patient previously had CAD treated medically, but now presents with recurrent chest pain and EKG changes, concerning for further ischemia. Her chest pain has been controlled with nitroglycerin infusion. 

The patient also has acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an EF of 25% at the outside hospital, but a repeat echo at this hospital showed an EF of 40%, consistent with prior echo. She still experiences shortness of breath but with improved symptoms compared to the day of admission.

The patient has recently lost her mother to cancer and recently lost her job. She denies suicidal/homicidal ideation or depression. Social work has been consulted for coping strategies.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/63 mmHg to 123/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted recurrent chest pain.

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and"
