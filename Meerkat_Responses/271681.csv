","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on warfarin, hypertension (HTN), alcohol abuse, and medical non-compliance. He was admitted to the ICU for severe epistaxis that required balloon packing in the emergency department. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with difficulty controlling blood pressure despite being on hydralazine and labetalol. The patient also has an exposure incident, allergies to no known drugs, and has received various medications including cefazolin, diltiazem, metoprolol, and ativan for suspected withdrawal. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but slightly decreased hematocrit and creatinine levels. There are also abnormalities in the liver function tests and electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Epistaxis: The patient presented with severe epistaxis that required balloon packing. It is important to monitor for any signs of recurrent bleeding and maintain pressure dressing with balloon to achieve hemostasis.
2. Uncontrolled HTN: The patient's blood pressure is difficult to control, which can contribute to further complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or heart failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications are necessary.
3. H/o DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently non-compliant with INR checks. Resuming ant"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on warfarin, poorly controlled hypertension, and epistaxis. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 161/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient has been receiving various medications including cefazolin, diltiazem, metoprolol, labetalol, and morphine IV prn for pain management. The patient's recent lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.1, hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL, platelet count of 349 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose level of 104 mg/dL, and an INR of 1.2.

The patient's assessment includes stable, slowly trending downward bleeding, with plans to embolize via neuro IR. The patient is also being monitored for hypertension, with goals to control blood pressure and hold further anticoagulation for now. A plan has been made to resume anticoagulation with lovenox to warfarin bridge once epistaxis is resolved. Additionally, the patient will undergo CIWA scale with prn valium and outpatient follow-up for alcohol withdrawal symptoms."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) abuse, presenting with epistaxis and significant bleeding. The patient has received Valium/Ativan for withdrawal, Afrin for recurrent bleeding, and coagulation factors and platelets are within normal limits. The patient is being managed by ENT with packing, with consideration for interventional radiology (IR) intervention if the bleeding worsens. The patient is also on cefazolin for infection. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for the current presentation. Vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxia. Fluid balance and respiratory support are being monitored. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, dullness on percussion, and diminished breath sounds. The patient's neurological status is attentive and follows simple commands. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is on cefazolin for infection, indicating a possible ongoing or previous infection.
2. Bleeding: Despite the use of coagulation factors and platelets, the patient continues to experience recurrent bleeding, which may require further intervention.
3. Hypoxia: The patient's SpO2 level of 94% suggests hypoxia, which can lead to complications if not adequately managed.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypertension, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.
5. Liver dysfunction: The slightly elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which can have various implications for the patient's overall health.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at an increased risk for thromboembolic events due to immobility and potential hypercoagulability.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to prolonged ICU stay and inadequate intake.
8. Delirium or other neurological complications: The patient's neurological status should be closely monitored for any signs of delirium or other neurological complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on warfarin and poorly controlled hypertension who presented with a nosebleed. The nosebleed was initially managed by the ENT, who repacked the nose and recommended further embolization via neuro IR if the bleeding recurs. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has remained stable, and the bleeding appears to have stopped. The patient continues to have bursts of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight, but these episodes are asymptomatic. The patient's hypertension is uncontrolled and is not believed to be related to ethanol withdrawal. The patient's history of DVT was last documented in [11-6] with a plan for warfarin therapy. However, the patient has been non-compliant with INR checks. There is no plan to resume anticoagulation after discharge, as the patient's nosebleed occurred in the setting of a subtherapeutic INR. The patient also has a history of ethanol abuse and may require further evaluation for possible withdrawal. The patient's diet is being advanced to full liquids, and pain management will be provided as needed. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending hemodynamic stability, with current ICU admission."
