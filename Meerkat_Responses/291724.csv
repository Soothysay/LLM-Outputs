","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenting, chronic atrial fibrillation (AF), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The patient presented with electric shock-like pain in his chest and had ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm during ablation. He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for further monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Arrhythmia: The patient's history of ventricular arrhythmia and recent VT storm during ablation puts him at risk for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias.
2. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of systolic CHF with an EF of 30%. Euvolemic appearance on exam suggests that fluid overload may not be a concern at this time, but continued monitoring is necessary.
3. Chronic Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has well-controlled rate regular atrial fibrillation except for brief episodes of ventricular arrhythmia. Restarting coumadin and beta-blocker for rate control is recommended.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: Holding amaryl while inpatient and managing with sliding scale insulin is appropriate for DM"

","Summary:
The patient is in the ICU with an HPI that includes arterial line and sheath starts and stops. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/56 mmHg to 116/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on CPAP. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with total input of 180 mL and total output of 850 mL. The patient is receiving various infusions and medications. The physical examination is not fully assessed due to limited information provided. Lab results show normal WBC count, Hct, and Plt, but elevated Cr, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, Ca++, and low Mg++. The patient has anxiety and sustained ventricular tachycardia. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient is currently experiencing sustained ventricular tachycardia, which can potentially lead to cardiac arrest if not promptly treated.
2. Infection: The elevated WBC count may indicate an underlying infection, which could complicate the patient's condition if left untreated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and subsequent left anterior descending (LAD) stenting. He also has a history of ventricular aneurysms, tachycardia, chronic atrial fibrillation (AFib), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, and has undergone single-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement.

The patient presents with electric shock-like chest pain and experiences recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) storms. He required pressor support during an ablation procedure and was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for further monitoring.

During the past week, the patient had recurrent ICD firing and was admitted to the electrophysiology (EP) department for VT ablation. Prior to the procedure, the patient went into recurrent VT leading to multiple ICD shocks. He was loaded with intravenous lidocaine with partial success. During the procedure, the patient required neosinephrine and dopamine to support his blood pressure. The underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and CABG surgery presenting with ventricular tachycardia. The patient underwent an ablation procedure for the VT but experienced recurrent episodes during the procedure and required vasopressor support. He was loaded with intravenous lidocaine with partial success. The underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia and the recent ablation procedure indicate a risk for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias.

2. Heart failure: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is reported as 30%, indicating systolic heart failure. Monitoring for signs of worsening heart failure and adjusting medications accordingly is important.

3. Thromboembolic events: The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke. Anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin is recommended to reduce this risk.

4. Infection: Given the patient's hospital stay and indwelling medical devices (e.g., ICD implant), there is a risk of developing healthcare-associated infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment if necessary is crucial.

5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 2, indicating chronic renal insufficiency. Regular monitoring of renal function and adjusting medications to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), three-vessel disease, myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenting, ventricular aneurysms, and tachycardia. He presents with electric shock-like chest pain and has been admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for further monitoring. The patient has a history of systolic heart failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension, gout, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmia: The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening and require prompt intervention.
2. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has a history of systolic heart failure, and any further decline in cardiac function may lead to heart failure exacerbation, resulting in fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
3. Stroke: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation, which can potentially lead to a stroke if dislodged.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly in the ICU setting, which can complicate his clinical course.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, and any further deterioration in renal function can lead to fluid overload"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He presents with electric shock-like pain in his chest and has been experiencing ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The patient has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%. He is currently admitted to the critical care unit for further monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and requires ongoing monitoring and management.

2. Systolic heart failure: The patient has an ejection fraction of 25%, indicating impaired cardiac function. Close monitoring of fluid balance and medication management is necessary to optimize heart function.

3. Chronic atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is well-controlled but requires rate control medication and anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events.

4. Fevers: The patient has low-grade fevers without clear evidence of infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause and prevent potential complications related to infection.

5. Chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 2, indicating renal dysfunction. Monitoring renal function and adjusting medications accordingly is important to prevent further deterioration.

6. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's diabetes should be managed"

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, there are several significant events that have occurred within the past 24 hours. The patient was febrile and cultured, indicating a possible infection. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure was low, leading to the decision to hold quinidine and a beta-blocker due to concerns about their effects on blood pressure. The attending physician prioritized restarting the beta-blocker once the patient's blood pressure stabilizes.

The patient also experienced some delay in urinating after the removal of a foley catheter and is being encouraged to drink more fluids. This could suggest potential urinary retention or decreased urine output, which needs to be monitored.

In terms of allergies, the patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics is not specified, and the patient is currently receiving Heparin Sodium at a rate of 1,350 units per hour. Other medications and ICU care are also being administered, but specific details are not provided.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (100.9 degrees Fahrenheit) and a current temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius (99.4 degrees Fahrenheit). The patient's heart rate is stable between 66-69 beats per minute, with a paced rhythm. Blood pressure readings show fluctuations, ranging from 103/49 mmHg to 127/89 mmHg.

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. He presents with symptoms of electric shock-like pain in his chest, VT storm, and required pressor support during ablation. The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%, and has undergone single-chamber ICD implantation. He is currently admitted to the CCU for further monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Arrhythmia: The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmias and ICD implantation, which puts him at risk for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias.
2. Thromboembolism: The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolism.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's systolic congestive heart failure may worsen, leading to symptoms like shortness of breath, fluid retention, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Infection: The patient's low-grade fevers suggest a possible infection, which needs to be investigated further.
5. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency may progress, leading to further elevation of creatinine levels and potential fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Gout: The patient's gout should be managed carefully, especially considering his renal insuff"

   Assessment and Plan
   81 yr old M with a PMH of CAD, three vessel disease s/p MI and CABG in
   [**2142**] and subsequent LAD stenting in [**2163**] complicated by ventricular
   aneurysms and tachycarrhythmias, chronic a. fib, systolic CHF with EF
   of 25% s/p single chamber ICD presents with electric shock-like pain in
   his chest. Patient had VT storm and required pressor support during
   ablation and has been admitted to CCU for further monitoring.
   .
   # Rhythm: Patient has ICD s/p ablation for ventricular arrhythmia
   leading to multiple episodes of ICD triggering. No further firings or
   ventricular arrhythmias noted.
   - Metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Quinidine held d/t renal failure
   - Magnet by bed-side in case repetitive firing, consider lidocaine
   - Continue heparin gtt until therapeutic on Coumadin, goal PTT 60-80.
   - Continue coumadin (for afib), goal INR [**2-11**] (1.5 today)
   - Telemetry
   - PFT
s so can consider use of Amiodarone as treatment in future
   .
   # Systolic Heart Failure: EF 30%. Patient appears euvolemic on exam.
   - Continue digoxin 0.125 mcg daily, eplerenone 25mg PO daily (an
   aldosterone antagonist), metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # CAD:  MI complicated by ventricular aneurysm and tachyarrhythmias.
   Three vessel CABG in [**2142**], and subsequent LAD stenting in [**2163**].
   Currently stable without evidence of ischemia.
   - Continue outpatient aspirin 81mg PO daily, simvastatin 40mg PO daily
   .
   # Chronic Atrial Fibrillation: Rate regular, no episodes of V tach o/n.
   - Beta blocker for rate control
   - Coumadin with INR [**2-11**] goal (1.5 today)
   - Heparin bridge until INR therapeutic with PTT goal 60-80

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, three-vessel disease post myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), ventricular aneurysm, tachycardia, chronic atrial fibrillation, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presents with electric shock-like pain in his chest and has been admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) for further monitoring.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), blood pressure ranging from 102/55 to 130/59 mmHg, heart rate between 60-81 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a bipap mask.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of low-grade fevers up to 100.6°F over the past 24 hours, which is attributed to an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection (UTI). The urine culture shows 10,000-100,000 organisms/mL, and he is sensitive to ciprofloxacin and Bactrim.

The patient's physical examination reveals inspiratory and expiratory wheezes bilater"
