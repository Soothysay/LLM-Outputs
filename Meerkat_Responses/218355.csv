   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have left lingular mass on rigid
   bronch [**3-24**], in MICU for failed exubation s/p bronch.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient with failed extubation after bronch.
   Unclear reasons for failed extubation (?bleeding after procedure)
   however, upon admission, the patient has been able to wean down
   ventilator support
   - Continue to wean down vent
   - SBT/trial PS tomorrow AM
   - continue antibiotics and nebs
   - suctioning and watch for evidence of active alveolar hemorrhage
   .
   # L lingular mass: Found to have new L lingular mass on bronchoscopy
   today which can likely explain his symptoms of cough, hemoptysis.
   Biopsies of two LNs were also taken during bronch. No evidence of
   infection (fever, leukocytosis, left shift, positive cultures) so far
   on hospital stay
   - f/u pathology specimens
   - pending path, may need oncology involvement for treatment, further
   workup to r/o metastases
   - may have post obstructive PNA, so overnight will continue broad
   spectrum abx (vanco/zosyn/azithromycin) however his symptoms may all be
   explained by his mass so if no evidence of infection, can be peeled off
   - obtain endotracheal sputum Cx
   - f/u BCx cultures
   - patient still not aware of results of bronch, wife wishes to be
   present during this discussion after her is extubated
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely [**1-17**] sedation with propofol. Was transferred on
   neosynephrine. No indication of infection/sepsis
   - wean down pressors as tolerated, keeping SBP>80, can bolus prn
   - watch UOP and keep>30cc/hr
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue omeprazole.
   .
   # FEN: PIV, hold on placing central line as we are weaning off pressors
   overnight
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF, former smoker, and hypertension. He presented with respiratory failure, hypoxia despite treatment with PNA, and a left lingular mass found on rigid bronchoscopy. He was admitted to the MICU for failed extubation after bronchoscopy. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, a new left lingular mass, hypotension likely due to sedation with propofol, and GERD/hiatal hernia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has already experienced respiratory failure, which is a serious condition that can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation of the lungs. This can result in further hypoxia and even cardiac arrest if not managed properly.

2. Lingular mass: The presence of a new left lingular mass suggests the possibility of lung cancer. If confirmed, it may require oncology involvement for treatment and further workup to rule out metastases.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sedation with propofol. Weaning off pressors and monitoring blood pressure closely will be important to prevent further drops in blood pressure.

4. GI side effects: The patient has had trouble tolerating antibiotics due to GI side effects. Monitoring for any signs of gastrointestinal distress or bleeding is important.

5. Infection: Although there is no evidence of infection at this time,"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have left lingular mass on rigid
   bronch [**3-24**], in MICU for failed exubation s/p bronch.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient with failed extubation after bronch.
   Unclear reasons for failed extubation  - ?bleeding, aspiration,
   mucous plug. Have been able to wean down vent overnight
   - Extubation this AM
   .
   # Question of pneumonia
   Considered post-obstructive pna given mass. Also consider IPF
   exacerbation.
   - follow up sputum culture
 deep sample sent this AM
   - continue vanc/zosyn/azithro for now
   # L lingular mass: Concern for primary lung CA. Found to have new L
   lingular mass on bronchoscopy today which can likely explain his
   symptoms of cough, hemoptysis. Biopsies of two LNs were also taken
   during bronch. No evidence of infection (fever, leukocytosis, left
   shift, positive cultures) so far on hospital stay
   - f/u pathology specimens
   - pending path, may need oncology involvement for treatment, further
   workup to r/o metastases
   - patient still not aware of results of bronch, wife wishes to be
   present during this discussion after her is extubated
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue omeprazole.

   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He presented with hypoxia despite treatment for pneumonia and was found to have a left lingular mass on rigid bronchoscopy. He is currently in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for failed extubation after bronchoscopy. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/54 mmHg to 127/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator. 

The patient's physical examination reveals few wheezes and bilateral lower field rales, regular S1 S2 heart sounds without murmurs or gallops, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds, and warm extremities without edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count of 331 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, platelet count of 99 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level of 0.8 mg/dL, creatinine level of 25 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, sodium level of 137 mEq/L, chloride level of 31.5%, and magnesium level of 11.7 K/uL. 

Radiology results show a chest X-ray with an endotracheal tube placed approximately 2 cm above the sternal angle, and bilateral infiltrates as before. 

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to failed extubation after bronchoscopy, question of pneumonia, consideration of post-obstructive pneumonia given the presence of a mass, and concern for primary lung cancer. Biopsies of two lymph nodes were taken during bronchoscopy, and no evidence of infection has been observed so far. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 540 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 4 breaths per minute. 

The patient's care includes ongoing monitoring, antibiotics for suspected infection, follow-up sputum culture, consideration of further workup for lung cancer, and continued enrollment in the RECAP trial for IPF. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a medical history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) and a new left lingular mass. He presented with respiratory failure and was intubated post-bronch. The patient has been receiving supplemental oxygen and sedation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 94/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 540 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and an RSBI of 69. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactic acid, and creatinine levels. The patient's overall condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying IPF, advanced age, and the presence of a new left lingular mass increase the risk of respiratory failure. The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which necessitates mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. The patient's baseline chest X-ray was close to normal, suggesting that there are no significant new infiltr"

   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have left lingular mass on rigid
   bronch [**3-24**], in MICU for failed exubation s/p bronch.
   .
   # Fevers
   Suspect pna  with increased sputum, cough
 in the setting of recent
   ventilation.
   Other noninfectious causes to consider in him seem less likely.
   Consider  clot, lung CA, drug fever. Latter seems less likely as no
   eos.
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   - continue vanc/zosyn/azithro for now
 will add cipro for additional
   gram negative coverage
   # Dyspnea
   Worsening SOB on presentation may have been due to Pna, IPF
   exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage. Does not appear significantly fluid
   overloaded currently
   Discussed with the patient that he is on the verge of needing
   intubation. He is not yet sure if he wants to back on a ventilator and
   wants some time to think this over.
   - treating for pna as above
   - IPF trial drug (perfenidone) on hold for now
   - Solumedrol
   - Given small amount of hemoptysis will hold on anticoagulation for
   now.
   - pursue further diuresis goal -1L as tolerated
   # L lingular mass: Concern for primary lung CA. Found to have new L
   lingular mass on bronchoscopy today which can likely explain his
   symptoms of cough, hemoptysis. Biopsies of two LNs were also taken
   during bronch. No evidence of infection (fever, leukocytosis, left
   shift, positive cultures) so far on hospital stay
   - f/u pathology specimens
   - pending path, may need oncology involvement for treatment, further
   workup to r/o metastases
   - patient still not aware of results of bronch, wife wishes to be
   present during this discussion after her is extubated
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF
   - adding
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue omeprazole.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a known diagnosis of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), who is a former smoker and has hypertension. He was admitted to the MICU for failed extubation after a bronchoscopy. The patient recently had a left lingular mass found on rigid bronchoscopy, and there is concern for primary lung cancer. He is experiencing fever, increased sputum production, and cough. The patient's dyspnea may be due to pneumonia, IPF exacerbation, or pulmonary hemorrhage. Fluid overload is not significantly present. The patient has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, corticosteroids, and diuretics. Further diagnostic tests, such as sputum culture and biopsy results, are pending. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, increased sputum production, and cough indicate a possible infection. The presence of diffuse airspace opacities on the chest X-ray also suggests pneumonia. This condition can worsen the patient's respiratory status and may require more aggressive treatment.
2. Lung Cancer: The discovery of a left lingular mass raises concern for primary lung cancer. If confirmed, this could significantly impact the patient's prognosis and treatment plan.
3. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient's worsening dyspnea could be attributed to pulmonary hemorrhage. This condition can lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have left lingular mass on rigid

   .
   # Fevers
   Suspect pna  with increased sputum, cough. [**Month (only) 51**] be post-obstructive pna
   given mass. Other noninfectious causes to consider in him would include
   clot, the lung CA itself, drug fever. Latter seems less likely as no
   eos. No clinical evidence for DVT.
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   - continue vanc/zosyn/azithro for now, would consider de-escalation
   based on sputum cx
   # Dyspnea
   Worsening SOB on presentation may have been due to Pna, IPF
   exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage. Does not appear significantly fluid
   overloaded currently
   - treating for pna as above
   - IPF trial drug (perfenidone) on hold for now
   - hold on further diuresis at this time
   # L lingular mass: Concern for primary lung CA. Found to have new L
   lingular mass on bronchoscopy today which can likely explain his
   symptoms of cough, hemoptysis. Biopsies of two LNs were also taken
   during bronch. No evidence of infection (fever, leukocytosis, left
   shift, positive cultures) so far on hospital stay
   - f/u pathology specimens
   - pending path, may need oncology involvement for treatment, further
   workup to r/o metastases
   - patient still not aware of results of bronch, wife wishes to be
   present during this discussion after her is extubated
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue omeprazole.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to failed extubation following a bronchoscopy. The patient's chief complaint includes increased work of breathing, fever, and cough. He has been extubated but experiences secretions and increased work of breathing. The patient's vital signs show fever, elevated heart rate, and slightly low blood pressure. He is receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for GERD and stress ulcers. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL and elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. The chest X-ray shows diffuse airspace opacities consistent with the patient's known diagnosis of IPF, but no increase in consolidations. The patient's assessment and plan include suspicion of pneumonia (PNA) with potential post-obstructive PNA due to a left lingular mass seen on bronchoscopy. Other possible causes of fever include drug fever, pulmonary embolism (clot), or lung cancer. The patient's dyspnea may be due to PNA, IPF exacerbation, or pulmonary hemorrhage. The plan involves treating for PNA, holding off on further diuresis, and following up on pathology specimens from the bronchoscopy. The patient's lingular"

   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have left lingular mass on rigid
   bronch [**3-24**], in MICU for failed exubation s/p bronch.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Patient with failed extubation after bronch.
   Unclear reasons for failed extubation  - ?bleeding, aspiration,
   mucous plug. Have been able to wean down vent overnight
   - Extubation this AM
   .
   # Question of pneumonia
   Considered post-obstructive pna given mass. Also consider IPF
   exacerbation.
   - follow up sputum culture
 deep sample sent this AM
   - continue vanc/zosyn/azithro for now
   # L lingular mass: Concern for primary lung CA. Found to have new L
   lingular mass on bronchoscopy today which can likely explain his
   symptoms of cough, hemoptysis. Biopsies of two LNs were also taken
   during bronch. No evidence of infection (fever, leukocytosis, left
   shift, positive cultures) so far on hospital stay
   - f/u pathology specimens
   - pending path, may need oncology involvement for treatment, further
   workup to r/o metastases
   - patient still not aware of results of bronch, wife wishes to be
   present during this discussion after her is extubated
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue omeprazole.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He presented with hypoxia despite treatment for pneumonia and was found to have a left lingular mass on rigid bronchoscopy. The patient has been admitted to the MICU for failed extubation after bronchoscopy. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, potential pneumonia, left lingular mass, and IPF exacerbation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's failed extubation suggests a risk of respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: There is a question of pneumonia, which could be post-obstructive given the presence of the left lingular mass. The patient is already on antibiotics, but monitoring for signs of infection and ensuring adequate culture coverage is essential.
3. Left Lingular Mass: The new left lingular mass raises concern for primary lung cancer. Further evaluation, including pathology specimens and imaging, is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment plan.
4. IPF Exacerbation: The patient has a history of IPF, and exacerbations can occur due to various triggers, including infections or environmental factors. Close monitoring of the patient's pulmonary status is necessary to manage any worsening symptoms.
5. GERD/Hiatal Hernia: The patient has been prescribed omeprazole for GERD/hiatal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was admitted for respiratory insufficiency. He presented with recurrent lingular opacity and shortness of breath, underwent bronchoscopy, and subsequently required intubation due to bleeding. The patient was extubated but continues to require high FiO2 and has been experiencing fever and increased secretions. His vital signs show a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/74 to 133/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Physical examination reveals warm skin, bilateral early inspiratory rales, expiratory wheeze, and inspiratory squeaks. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.7, slightly elevated lactate level, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows a presumed lung mass. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids, and diuretics to address potential reversible causes of his hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is acute on chronic. The possible etiologies include pneumonia, IPF exacerbation, fluid overload, or malignancy. The patient is critically ill and is being closely monitored in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year old man with IPF, s/p extubation but with marginal respiratory
   status , increasing secretions and now new fever. Has broad coverage
   with vanc + zosyn , would add
   additional gram negative [**Doctor Last Name **] today in light of apparent deterioration
   on that regimen. Continue aggresive diuresis today. We have little in
   the way of imaging evidence for an acute exacerbation of IPF
   and good history (secretions, fever) for new HAP/VAP. That said, he has
   recieved long and broad abx coverage without dramatic improvement. I
   think in light of that exacerbation has to be considered and I would
   favor adding steroids at this point, with cont. abx. Would not
   anticoagulate given complicationss at bronch and ongoing hemoptysis ,
   but perhaps this can be revisited if bleeding stabilizes. Also possible
   that he has PE given likely diagnosis of lung CA and worsening
   hypoxemia but with fever and secretions I think this is less likely.
   Overall, high risk for re-intubation. I have spoken with the patient
   and he is unsure if he would want ot re-intubated. Plan to meet with
   the patient and his wife later this morning. For now would hold off on
   intubation in any case as long as sats are stable and no further
   increase in WOB. Risk of VILI is quiet high and would prefer to avoid
   mechanical ventilation if we can. I agree with the remainder of the
   plan as outlined in the resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory insufficiency. He was extubated yesterday but still requires high FiO2 and has a fever. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/74 to 133/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including Azithromycin, Piperacillin, and Vancomycin. His recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. The blood cultures and urine culture have been sent for analysis. 

The patient's condition is complicated by increasing secretions and new-onset fever, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 94%. 

The plan is to continue aggressive diuresis and consider adding additional gram-negative coverage due to the apparent deterioration on the current antibiotic regimen. The possibility of steroid treatment for acute exacerbation of IPF or lung cancer is also being considered. However, the decision to intubate the patient is pending, as the patient is unsure about wanting to be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of COPD, IPF, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, increased secretions, worsening oxygenation, and decreased mental status. Despite being on high-flow nasal cannula, the patient's saturation levels have remained low. Imaging revealed worsening right-sided opacities on chest X-ray. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/65 mmHg to 132/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and temperature of 35.7°C. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.7 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin at 11.3 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated creatinine at 0.8 mg/dL. The patient's urine output has been fluctuating, with a total output of 2,360 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient remains intubated and sedated, with ongoing respiratory support. The patient's family has been updated on the current situation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and worsening lung opacities on chest X-ray, there is a risk"

   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have left lingular mass on rigid
   bronch [**3-24**], in MICU for failed exubation s/p bronch.
   .
   # Fevers
   Suspect pna  with increased sputum, cough
 in the setting of recent
   ventilation.
   Other noninfectious causes to consider in him seem less likely.
   Consider  clot, lung CA, drug fever. Latter seems less likely as no
   eos.
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   - continue vanc/zosyn/azithro for now
 will add cipro for additional
   gram negative coverage
   # Dyspnea
   Worsening SOB on presentation may have been due to Pna, IPF
   exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage. Does not appear significantly fluid
   overloaded currently
   Discussed with the patient that he is on the verge of needing
   intubation. He is not yet sure if he wants to back on a ventilator and
   wants some time to think this over.
   - treating for pna as above
   - IPF trial drug (perfenidone) on hold for now
   - Solumedrol
   - Given small amount of hemoptysis will hold on anticoagulation for
   now.
   - pursue further diuresis goal -1L as tolerated
   # L lingular mass: Concern for primary lung CA. Found to have new L
   lingular mass on bronchoscopy today which can likely explain his
   symptoms of cough, hemoptysis. Biopsies of two LNs were also taken
   during bronch. No evidence of infection (fever, leukocytosis, left
   shift, positive cultures) so far on hospital stay
   - f/u pathology specimens
   - pending path, may need oncology involvement for treatment, further
   workup to r/o metastases
   - patient still not aware of results of bronch, wife wishes to be
   present during this discussion after her is extubated
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF
   - adding
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue omeprazole.

Treatment includes antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn/Azithro) with the addition of Cipro for gram-negative coverage, steroids (Solumedrol), and diuretics (Lasix) to pursue further diuresis. The patient also has a concern for primary lung cancer, given the new left lingular mass found during bronchoscopy. Biopsies of two lymph nodes were taken, and the patient is awaiting pathology results. He is enrolled in the RECAP trial for IPF but has been unable to tolerate the perfenidone due to illness and GI side effects. The patient's GERD/hiatal hernia is being managed with omeprazole."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF, former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU for failed extubation after bronchoscopy. The patient has been experiencing fevers, cough, and increased sputum production. His respiratory support has been stepped up to high flow nasal cannula due to hypoxia. The patient has shown some improvement in symptoms such as feeling better, less shortness of breath, and less sputum production. However, there are concerns regarding potential medical complications including pneumonia, lung cancer, and pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient also has a left lingular mass that could explain his symptoms and is being further evaluated. The patient's IPF treatment is currently on hold due to intolerance of the medication and side effects. He is also being treated for GERD/hiatal hernia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fevers, cough, and increased sputum production, along with his recent ventilation, raise suspicion for pneumonia. He is already receiving appropriate antibiotics for this condition.
2. Lung Cancer: The presence of a new left lingular mass on bronchoscopy raises concern for primary lung cancer. Biopsies of two lymph nodes were taken during bronchoscopy, and pathology results are pending.
3. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: Although the patient's worsening shortness of breath may have been initially due to pneumonia or IPF exacerbation,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to failed extubation after undergoing a bronchoscopy for a left lingular mass. The patient is being treated for HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Chief Complaint:
   - The patient's main complaint is dyspnea, which has improved slightly.

2. 24-Hour Events:
   - The patient received 20IV lasix due to a fluid balance of -500cc.
   - Steroids were added for IPF exacerbation.
   - The patient's PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor) was switched from oral to intravenous.
   - The patient's CXR (Chest X-ray) showed worsening right-sided opacities today, along with increased secretions and slight increased work of breathing (WOB). Oxygen saturation (Sats) were held on 5-6L face mask at 80%.
   - The patient's gram-negative coverage was expanded, and Cipro was added due to continued spikes in cultures.
   - If the patient desaturates tomorrow, a TTE (Transesophageal Echocardiogram) may be considered as the patient cannot tolerate a CTA (Computed Tomography Angiography).

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have left lingular mass on rigid
   bronch [**3-24**], in MICU for failed exubation s/p bronch.
   .
   # Fevers
   Suspect pna  with increased sputum, cough
 in the setting of recent
   ventilation.
   Other noninfectious causes to consider in him seem less likely.
   Consider  clot, lung CA, drug fever. Latter seems less likely as no
   eos.
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   - continue vanc/zosyn/azithro for now
 will add cipro for additional
   gram negative coverage
   # Dyspnea
   Worsening SOB on presentation may have been due to Pna, IPF
   exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage. Does not appear significantly fluid
   overloaded currently
   Discussed with the patient that he is on the verge of needing
   intubation. He is not yet sure if he wants to back on a ventilator and
   wants some time to think this over.
   - treating for pna as above
   - IPF trial drug (perfenidone) on hold for now
   - Solumedrol
   - Given small amount of hemoptysis will hold on anticoagulation for
   now.
   - pursue further diuresis goal -1L as tolerated
   # L lingular mass: Concern for primary lung CA. Found to have new L
   lingular mass on bronchoscopy today which can likely explain his
   symptoms of cough, hemoptysis. Biopsies of two LNs were also taken
   during bronch. No evidence of infection (fever, leukocytosis, left
   shift, positive cultures) so far on hospital stay
   - f/u pathology specimens
   - pending path, may need oncology involvement for treatment, further
   workup to r/o metastases
   - patient still not aware of results of bronch, wife wishes to be
   present during this discussion after her is extubated
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF
   - adding
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue omeprazole.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure after unsuccessful outpatient antibiotic courses. The patient's hospital course included defervescence once broad-spectrum antibiotics were started, hemoptysis for which he underwent bronchoscopy, and worsening respiratory failure following the procedure. 

The patient's current condition is described as hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration, pneumonia, IPF flare, or hematemesis. The treatment plan involves continuing vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and Zosyn for presumed community-acquired pneumonia, along with methylprednisolone for presumed IPF flare, aiming for tuberculosis-negative status, and implementing aspiration precautions and aggressive pulmonary toilet. 

Additionally, there is a pulmonary mass concerning for malignancy, and a biopsy has been taken for further evaluation. The patient also has difficulty taking oral medications, so a Dobhoff tube will be placed for tube feeds. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires nutrition support through tube feeds once the Dobhoff is placed, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a PICC line for IV antibiotics. Prophylactic measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), H2 blocker for stress ulcer, and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. He was initially given antibiotics as an outpatient but did not improve. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy with IP evaluation, which revealed a possible lingular mass concerning for cancer. After the procedure, he experienced worsening respiratory failure requiring reintubation. He has since been extubated but remains in a tenuous respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a possibility of aspiration, pneumonia, IPF flare, or hematemesis.
2. Pulmonary mass concerning for malignancy: The presence of a pulmonary mass raises concerns about lung cancer. Further evaluation is needed, awaiting pathology results.
3. Difficulty taking POs: The patient has difficulty taking oral medications, so a feeding tube (dobbhoff) will be placed for tube feeds.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who presented with progressive respiratory failure as an outpatient. He was admitted for intravenous antibiotics but developed worsening respiratory failure after a bronchoscopy, which revealed an airway obstructing mass in the lingula concerning for malignancy. The patient has since been extubated in the ICU but remains with tenuous respiratory status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/75 mmHg to 132/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow nasal cannula. His review of systems includes productive cough, persistent dyspnea, decreased appetite, and no chest pain.

The patient's labs show a hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, leukocyte count of 373 K/uL, platelet count of 164 mg/dL, sodium level of 30 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and glucose level of 99 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH: 7.30, PaCO2: 30 mmHg, PaO2: 55 mmHg, and HCO3-: 12 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging shows bilateral opacities on chest X-ray, which are stable. The physical examination reveals cyanosis, speaking in short sentences, tachypneic with speaking, crackles at bases bilaterally, cool extremities without edema, and neurologically alert and interactive.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to aspiration, pneumonia, IPF flare, or hematemesis. He is being treated with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam for presumed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and methylprednisolone for presumed IPF flare. Aspiration precautions and aggressive pulmonary toilet are also being implemented. The pulmonary mass concerning for malignancy is awaiting pathology results.

The patient's feeding tube placement is planned due to difficulty taking oral medications, and tube feeds will be started once the tube is in place. Glycemic control is being maintained with regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple IV lines, including a PICC line for IV antibiotics. Prophylactic measures include DVT boots, stress ulcer H2 blocker, and VAP elevation of head of bed.

The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the MICU for failed extubation after undergoing a rigid bronchoscopy. The patient is being treated for HAP (Healthcare-associated Pneumonia). He has a left lingular mass on the chest X-ray, which is suspected to be squamous cell lung cancer. The patient's symptoms include increased sputum production, cough, and dyspnea, which have improved since starting antibiotics. His vital signs show a slightly low blood pressure and an increased heart rate. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and decreased platelet count. His renal function is normal, but he has mildly elevated liver enzymes. The patient is currently on multiple medications including PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor), diuretics, steroids, and antibiotics. He is also receiving IV fluids and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest an ongoing infection. If not properly managed, there is a risk of worsening pneumonia and potential sepsis.
2. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The presence of a left lingular mass raises concerns for squamous cell lung cancer. Further evaluation and staging are needed to determine appropriate treatment options.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU for failed extubation after a rigid bronchoscopy, and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. His recent progress includes improved fever, decreased sputum production, and improved oxygenation. However, he continues to require increased amounts of supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's current treatment plan includes a 10-day course of vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin. Despite improvement in fever, there is ongoing sputum production and cough, indicating a potential ongoing infection.
2. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has been diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Further evaluation and discussion with a medical oncologist are needed to determine the appropriate staging and treatment options.
3. Dyspnea: The patient's shortness of breath has improved but still requires increased oxygen supplementation. The cause of this dyspnea could be attributed to pneumonia, IPF exacerbation, or pulmonary hemorrhage.
4. IPF: The patient is participating in the RECAP trial and was initially prescribed perfenidone; however, he was unable to tolerate it due to gastrointestinal side effects. It"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for failed extubation following a rigid bronchoscopy to evaluate a left lingular mass. The patient was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and has shown improvement in fevers but still requires increased oxygen support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient was initially treated for HAP, which seems to have improved. However, there is still concern for ongoing infection, especially since the sputum culture results are pending. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and lab parameters to ensure that the infection does not recur or worsen.

2. Lung Cancer: The presence of a left lingular mass raises concern for primary lung cancer. Biopsies of two lymph nodes were taken during bronchoscopy, but the results are still pending. If the pathology confirms malignancy, the patient may require oncology involvement for treatment planning and further workup to rule out metastases.

3. IPF Exacerbation: The patient has a history of IPF, and his worsening dyspnea could be due to an exacerbation of the underlying lung disease. Treatment for IPF has been put on hold due to the acute illness, but it may need to be resumed once the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a confirmed diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/67 to 132/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is also experiencing anxiety and tachypnea, for which they have been given morphine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition involves acute respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation. The underlying cause of this failure needs to be addressed promptly to improve the patient's respiratory function and wean off the ventilator.

2. Infection: The presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection. Further investigation is necessary to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

3. Cancer Progression: The patient has been diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. It is important to closely monitor the patient's cancer progression and consider further oncological treatment options as per the doctor's plan.

4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,090 mL since the last measurement. This indicates ongoing fluid losses, which need to be managed carefully to maintain adequate hydration and prevent complications such as hypotension"

   - will talk with med onc about staging, treatment options
   - further discussions with patient and family pending definitive
   results
   # Dyspnea
   SOB is improved, unclear if this reflects steroids or delayed abx
   effect. Still with increased O2 requirement
   Worsening SOB on presentation may have been due to Pna, IPF
   exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage. Had some diuresis yesterday which
   may have helped patient
   - treating for pna as above
   - IPF trial drug (perfenidone) on hold for now
   - Given small amount of hemoptysis will hold on anticoagulation for
   now.
   - continue further diuresis today, gentle PRN
   - make nebs PRN
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF (perfenidone)
   - continue IV steroids (day#3 today)-- switch IV Solumed to prednisone
   tomorrow
   .
   #Agitation:
   -continue PRN ativan

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF, former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the MICU for failed extubation after undergoing rigid bronchoscopy for suspected HAP. The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia and has been diagnosed with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. He is also being treated for dyspnea, IPF exacerbation, and pulmonary hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment. However, there is a risk of treatment failure or development of antibiotic resistance due to the ongoing infection.
2. Squamous cell lung cancer: The patient has been diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer. Further discussions with the medical oncology team will determine the staging and treatment options for the cancer.
3. Dyspnea: The patient's shortness of breath (dyspnea) may be due to pneumonia, IPF exacerbation, or pulmonary hemorrhage. Continued treatment for pneumonia and diuresis may help alleviate symptoms. However, close monitoring is required as worsening dyspnea could indicate a decline in the patient's condition.
4. IPF exacerbation: The patient has a history of IPF, and exacerbation of this condition may contribute to his respiratory symptoms. Treatment for IPF is ongoing, but it may need to be adjusted based on the patient's response and tolerability.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who presented with respiratory failure. It was unclear whether the respiratory failure was due to pneumonia (PNA) or an IPF flare. Subsequently, the patient was found to have metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The patient has been receiving various antibiotics and other ICU medications, including pantoprazole, furosemide, lorazepam, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/66 to 132/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's review of systems is primarily focused on respiratory distress, with the presence of dyspnea. Physical examination reveals crackles in the bilateral chest, right lower extremity edema (absent), left lower extremity edema (absent), muscle wasting, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 11.7 to 15.5 thousand/mm³, hematocrit levels between 31.5% and 33.5%, platelet count between 14 and 24 thousand/mm³,"

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who presented with respiratory failure. The cause of the respiratory failure is likely related to pneumonia (PNA) versus an IPF flare. The patient was found to have metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). 

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given on 03-25-2119 at 08:05 PM. 

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), furosemide (Lasix), lorazepam (Ativan), and morphine sulfate. 

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for dyspnea. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/66 to 132/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on high flow nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and muscle wasting. 

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 414 K/uL, sodium level of 152 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.8 mg/dL, and glucose level of 152 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient's assessment and plan include hypoxemic respiratory failure due to PNA and IPF flare. The plan involves continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, starting IV solumedrol and transitioning to oral prednisone, continuing thiamine supplementation, and providing prn morphine and ativan for air hunger and anxiety. 

The patient also has a singular obstructing mass, for which a hematology/oncology consult has been placed on hold at the patient's request. If respiratory failure does not improve, consideration will be given to radiation therapy consult for palliation. 

Regarding feeding, it has been decided to encourage PO intake and hold off on doboff and tube feeds for patient comfort. 

The patient's overall goals of care are being discussed with his family, considering the new finding of lung cancer. 

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. 

The patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have left lingular mass on rigid
   bronch [**3-24**], in MICU for failed extubation s/p bronch being treated for
   HAP.
   .
   # Pneumonia
   Suspect pna  with increased sputum, cough
 in the setting of recent
   ventilation.
   Fevers now improved, but in setting of steroids yesterday
 no fever
   for more than 24 hours
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   - continue vanc (d8) /zosyn (d5) and cipro (d3)
 plan for 10 day
   course
   # Squamous cell lung CA
   - will talk with med onc about staging, treatment options
   - further discussions with patient and family pending definitive
   results
   # Dyspnea
   SOB is improved, unclear if this reflects steroids or delayed abx
   effect. Still with increased O2 requirement
   Worsening SOB on presentation may have been due to Pna, IPF
   exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage. Had some diuresis yesterday which
   may have helped patient
   - treating for pna as above
   - IPF trial drug (perfenidone) on hold for now
   - Given small amount of hemoptysis will hold on anticoagulation for
   now.
   - continue further diuresis today, gentle PRN
   - make nebs PRN
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF (perfenidone)
   - continue IV steroids (day#3 today)-- switch IV Solumed to prednisone
   tomorrow
   .
   #Agitation:
   -continue PRN ativan
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue omeprazole.

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the MICU for failed extubation following a bronchoscopic procedure and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

The patient's chief complaint includes a cough and increased sputum production. His vital signs show a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 111/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery and requires increased O2. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, pantoprazole (Protonix), morphine sulfate, lorazepam (Ativan), and furosemide (Lasix).

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.5 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and slightly low platelet count of 14 K/uL. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, electrolytes, and liver enzymes are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, squamous cell lung cancer, dyspnea, and IPF. The plan includes follow-up sputum culture, continuing antibiotics, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have left lingular mass on rigid
   bronch [**3-24**], in MICU for failed extubation s/p bronch being treated for
   HAP and with continued hypoxemia
   .
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory failure
   SOB is improved, unclear if this reflects steroids or delayed abx
   effect. Still with increased O2 requirement despite treatment for last
   48 hours (on 80-100% high flow mask with 6L NC O2 with desaturations
   with eating). Worsening SOB on presentation may have been due to Pna,
   IPF exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage. Trying to wean down on O2
   requirements with diuresis
   - treating with abx for PNA
   - continue steroids to treat for IPF exacerbation
   - continue further diuresis today, IV lasix boluses for goal 1L
   negative
   - make nebs PRN
   - plan for conversation with outpatient pulmonologist today regarding
   goals/whether to pursue treatment options for left lung mass to help
   with respiratory failure
   # Pneumonia: R sided consolidation on CXR. Patient with some coughing
   after eating as diet had been advanced yesterday
   - speech and swallow consult today
   - aspiration precautions
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   - continue vanc (d9) /zosyn (d6) and cipro (d4)
 plan for 10 day
   course
   # Squamous cell lung CA: L lingular mass with spread to
 lymph node
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for whether to pursue oncology treatment
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF (perfenidone)
   - continue IV steroids (day#4 today)
   .
   #Agitation:
   -continue PRN ativan
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue omeprazole.

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU for failed extubation after a bronchoscopic procedure to treat HAP (Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia). The patient continues to experience hypoxemia despite treatment and is currently on high flow mask with NC O2. 

The patient's dyspnea and respiratory failure have improved, but he still requires increased O2 requirements. His worsening SOB on presentation may have been due to PNA (Pneumocystis pneumonia), IPF exacerbation, or pulmonary hemorrhage. The plan is to continue steroids to treat for IPF exacerbation, further diuresis, and make nebs PRN (as needed). 

The patient also has pneumonia, with consolidation on CXR. There will be a speech and swallow consult today, along with aspiration precautions. Sputum culture, other microbiology, and CIS (Computed Tomography Scan) follow-up are planned. Antibiotic therapy will be continued for a 10-day course.

Additionally, the patient has squamous cell lung CA (Cancer), with a left lingular mass and lymph node involvement. It is being discussed with Dr. [Last Name (Title)] whether to pursue oncology treatment.

The patient has IPF and is currently in the RECAP trial. However, he has been unable to tolerate perfenidone due to illness and trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects. 

The patient is also experiencing agitation and will continue PRN (as needed) ativan. He has a history of GERD/hiatal hernia and will continue omeprazole.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia). The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate), and his current disposition is in the ICU."

   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have left lingular mass on rigid
   bronch [**3-24**], in MICU for failed extubation s/p bronch being treated for
   HAP and with continued hypoxemia
   .
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory failure
   SOB is improved, unclear if this reflects steroids or delayed abx
   effect. Still with increased O2 requirement despite treatment for last
   48 hours (on 80-100% high flow mask with 6L NC O2 with desaturations
   with eating). Worsening SOB on presentation may have been due to Pna,
   IPF exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage. Trying to wean down on O2
   requirements with diuresis
   - treating with abx for PNA
   - continue steroids to treat for IPF exacerbation
   - continue further diuresis today, IV lasix boluses for goal 1L
   negative
   - make nebs PRN
   - plan for conversation with outpatient pulmonologist today regarding
   goals/whether to pursue treatment options for left lung mass to help
   with respiratory failure
   # Pneumonia: R sided consolidation on CXR. Patient with some coughing
   after eating as diet had been advanced yesterday
   - speech and swallow consult today
   - aspiration precautions
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   - continue vanc (d9) /zosyn (d6) and cipro (d4)
 plan for 10 day
   course
   # Squamous cell lung CA: L lingular mass with spread to
 lymph node
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for whether to pursue oncology treatment
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF (perfenidone)
   - continue IV steroids (day#4 today)
   .
   #Agitation:
   -continue PRN ativan
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue omeprazole.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the MICU for failed extubation following bronchoscopy, treated for HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia), and continues to have hypoxemia. The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia, IPF exacerbation, and a left lung mass suspected to be squamous cell lung cancer. He also has a history of GERD and hiatal hernia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's SOB (shortness of breath) is improved but still has increased O2 requirement despite treatment. There is a risk of respiratory failure due to underlying conditions such as IPF exacerbation, pneumonia, and lung mass.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right-sided consolidation on CXR (chest X-ray), indicating pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening infection and sepsis if not appropriately treated.
3. Aspiration: The patient coughs after eating, which may indicate aspiration risk. This could lead to aspiration pneumonia or other complications.
4. Squamous cell lung cancer: The left lingular mass suggests squamous cell lung cancer with lymph node spread. There is a risk of disease progression and metastasis.
5. IPF exacerbation: The patient's IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) may worsen due to the ongoing lung infection and other factors.

","The patient is a 72-inch tall adult with an unknown weight, presenting with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been receiving various medications including steroids, antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam), pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, lorazepam, and furosemide.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate between 50-86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/62 mmHg to 135/81 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on high flow nasal cannula.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted fever. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose levels, and normal platelet count. Other lab values including sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, liver enzymes, and coagulation studies are within normal limits. The patient's chest X-ray shows persistent bilateral opacities, and cultures are pending.

The patient has been diagnosed with fever, anxiety, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and is being managed in the ICU. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through ICU care, and"

   effect. Still with increased O2 requirement despite treatment for last
   48 hours (on 80-100% high flow mask with 6L NC O2 with desaturations
   with eating). Worsening SOB on presentation may have been due to Pna,
   IPF exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage. Trying to wean down on O2
   requirements with diuresis
   - treating with abx for PNA
   - continue steroids to treat for IPF exacerbation
   - continue further diuresis today, IV lasix boluses for goal 1L

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He presented with hypoxia despite treatment for PNA (Pneumonia), and was found to have a left lingular mass on rigid bronchoscopy. The patient has been in the MICU for failed extubation and is being treated for HAP (Healthcare-associated Pneumonia) with continued hypoxemia. His current condition includes dyspnea/respiratory failure, pneumonia, squamous cell lung cancer, and IPF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dyspnea and increased oxygen requirement indicate a risk of respiratory failure due to the underlying conditions such as IPF, pneumonia, and lung mass.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with HAP, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent worsening of symptoms and complications.
3. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The presence of a left lingular mass suggests the possibility of squamous cell lung cancer. Further evaluation and treatment planning are necessary to manage this condition effectively.
4. IPF Exacerbation: The patient's worsening respiratory symptoms may be attributed to an exacerbation of IPF. Close monitoring and management of IPF symptoms are essential in this case.
5. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's coughing after eating indicates a risk of aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration precautions should be continued"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), who was recently diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been on high-flow oxygen, antibiotics, and steroids for his conditions. His vital signs are stable, but he still requires a significant amount of oxygen. The patient's respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen delivery and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). He has shown some improvement in his dyspnea but continues to have increased oxygen requirements. The patient's blood cultures and sputum cultures are negative, indicating no bacterial growth. His laboratory values indicate mild anemia, leukocytosis, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal right-sided consolidation on chest X-ray and a mass in the left lingular region with lymph node involvement, consistent with squamous cell lung cancer. The patient's family has made the decision to follow a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) status. The plan is to continue treatment for HAP, optimize the patient's oxygenation, manage his IPF exacerbation with diuretics, and consult with oncology and radiation oncology for potential palliative treatment options for the lung cancer."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU for failed extubation after a rigid bronchoscopy. The patient has been treated for HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia) and continues to have hypoxemia despite treatment. He also has a left lingular mass, which is suspected to be squamous cell lung cancer with lymph node involvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ongoing dyspnea and increased O2 requirements, indicating potential respiratory failure. This may be due to IPF exacerbation, pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or complications from the lung mass.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right-sided consolidation on the CXR, indicating pneumonia. He is already receiving antibiotics, but close monitoring for any worsening symptoms is necessary.
3. Aspiration: The patient coughs after eating, and there is a risk of aspiration, especially since his diet was advanced yesterday. Speech and swallow consult has been ordered, and aspiration precautions should be maintained.
4. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The presence of a left lingular mass with lymph node spread suggests squamous cell lung cancer. Further evaluation and discussion with an oncologist are needed to determine the appropriate treatment options.
5. IPF Exacerbation: The patient's IPF may be worsening due to the lung mass, pneumonia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) and former smoker, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has been found to have SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) and is experiencing respiratory failure. The patient is critically ill and has been on mechanical ventilation. The medical team is providing aggressive pulmonary toilet, continuous antibiotics for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia, diuretics for fluid management, and encouraging out-of-bed chair positioning. The patient's SCC involves a lingular mass with lymph node involvement, and a consultation with hematology/oncology has been arranged for possible palliative options and radiation therapy. The patient is also receiving nutritional support with a liberal diet and glycemic control through regular insulin sliding scale. The patient's ICU care includes prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP, with a current code status of DNR/DNI."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) and former smoking status, who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. He has been found to have a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the lingular region involving 12-17 lymph nodes. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a high flow nasal cannula, and his oxygen saturation is at 96%. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/55 mmHg to 135/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 96%. The patient has a weak appearance but is pleasant and alert. Physical examination reveals dry crackles midway bilaterally, warm extremities with mild peripheral cyanosis, and no edema. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, kidney function tests, and blood gases are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, possibly due to his underlying IPF, SCC, and presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Continued antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piper"

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. They are also on infusions of furosemide and various other ICU medications such as lansoprazole, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature within normal range, a slightly low blood pressure, normal heart rate, and slightly low respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is at 98% with high flow nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,232 mL, with total output of 2,585 mL including 170 mL of blood product transfusion. Urine output is 2,585 mL. No other fluid or drain measurements are provided.

Blood work reveals a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 424 K/uL. Sodium levels are within normal range, while potassium is slightly low. Creatinine levels are stable, and glucose levels have fluctuated throughout the day. Other lab results, including PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, kidney function tests, and electrolytes, are within normal limits.

   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have new squamous cell lung ca &
   in MICU for failed extubation s/p bronch being treated for HAP and with
   continued hypoxemia
   .
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory failure
   SOB is improved, unclear if this reflects steroids or delayed abx
   effect. Still with increased O2 requirement despite treatment for last
   72 hours (on 60% high flow mask with 6L NC O2 with desaturations with
   eating). Worsening SOB on presentation may have been due to Pna, IPF
   exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage. Trying to wean down on O2
   requirements with diuresis
   - treating with abx for PNA
   - continue steroids to treat for IPF exacerbation; current dose
   - continue further diuresis today, switch to lasix drip, goal I/O
   negative 1L
   - goal to wean down O2 requirement where may be able to go to floor,
   not yet ready today
   # Pneumonia: R sided consolidation on CXR. Patient with some coughing
   after eating as diet had been advanced yesterday. Patient passed
   speech/swallow test today
   - aspiration precautions
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   - d/c Cipro today
   - continue vanc (d9) /zosyn (d6)
 plan for 10 day course
   # Squamous cell lung CA: L lingular mass with spread to 1 of 2  lymph
   nodes
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recs
   - f/up Oncology and Rad/Onc consults today regarding whether have
   treatment options for palliation, symptom control
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF (perfenidone)
   - continue IV steroids (day#4 today)
   .
   #Agitation:
   -continue PRN ativan & morphine
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue protonix 40mg q daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He presented with hypoxia despite treatment for pneumonia (PNA) and was found to have a new squamous cell lung cancer. He is currently in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for failed extubation after bronchoscopic intervention and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with continued hypoxemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing dyspnea and increased oxygen requirements, indicating potential respiratory failure. This can be due to underlying lung diseases such as IPF exacerbation, pneumonia, or complications from lung cancer.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has right-sided consolidation on CXR, suggesting pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and further respiratory failure if not treated appropriately.

3. Aspiration: The patient coughs after eating, which may indicate aspiration risk. Aspiration precautions should be continued to prevent further aspiration events.

4. Squamous cell lung cancer: The patient has a left lung mass with spread to one of the two lymph nodes. Treatment options for palliation and symptom control should be discussed with oncology and radiation oncology consults.

5. IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis): The patient has a history of IPF, which can worsen with exacerbations. Close monitoring and management of IPF"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU for failed extubation after a bronchoscopic procedure and is being treated for HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia). The patient continues to have significant oxygen requirements and worsening shortness of breath, which may be due to pneumonia, IPF exacerbation, or pulmonary hemorrhage.

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient still has a significant requirement for supplemental oxygen. The worsening shortness of breath on presentation may be due to PNA (Pneumonia), IPF exacerbation, or pulmonary hemorrhage.
2. Pneumonia: The patient initially had right-sided consolidation on the chest X-ray, but it has improved. No pathogens have been isolated. The patient is currently on a complete 10-day course of Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.
3. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a left lung mass with spread to one of the two lymph nodes sampled during bronchoscopy. Oncology and Radiation Oncology consultations have been requested to discuss treatment options for palliation and symptom control.
4. IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis): The patient is currently enrolled in the RECAP trial for IPF but has been unable to tolerate perfenidone due to his illness and GI side effects"

The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to hypoxia despite treatment with pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with new squamous cell lung cancer and is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). His vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 111/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient's lung examination reveals dry bibasilar crackles and scattered expiratory wheezes. His abdominal examination is soft and obese, and his peripheral vascular examination shows weak peripheral pulses. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal electrolyte levels. The patient's medical history includes previous treatment for HAP, IPF exacerbation, and pulmonary hemorrhage. He has been on various medications such as lasix, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and morphine sulfate.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who presented initially with presumed CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia) and was started on IV antibiotics. However, he developed hemoptysis and a subsequent bronchoscopy revealed an obstructing pulmonary mass in the lingula. Biopsy results confirmed SCLC (Small Cell Lung Cancer). The patient's hospital course has been complicated by respiratory failure, for which he is currently in the ICU receiving supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Continuous monitoring and appropriate respiratory support will be necessary to manage this condition.
2. Malignancy: The presence of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung increases the risk of complications related to the cancer itself, such as metastasis or local invasion. Consulting with hematology-oncology specialists will help determine future treatment options for the malignancy.
3. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer and hospitalization, there is a risk of developing new infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection, including fever, increased white blood cell count, or changes in vital signs, is important.
4. Bleeding: Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) is already present, and the patient may continue to be at risk for bleeding complications due to the cancer and potential treatment-related factors"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, pneumonia, and squamous cell lung cancer. The patient has been treated with antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam) for HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia) and continues to require supplemental oxygen. His vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/71 to 152/132 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's physical examination reveals dry bibasilar crackles, rales in the right middle lung field, scattered expiratory wheezes, and no murmurs. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with normal creatinine and glucose levels. Other labs indicate slightly elevated liver enzymes and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, lorazepam, morphine sulfate, and others. His current plan includes completing a 10-day course of Vancomycin/Zosyn for pneumonia, continuing steroids to treat for IPF exacerbation, switching from IV to PO Lasix, and weaning down oxygen requirements.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia), and a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. He is currently in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for failed extubation after a bronchoscopic procedure. The patient has been treated for HAP and continues to have hypoxemia despite treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient still requires significant oxygen supplementation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. This may be due to pneumonia, IPF exacerbation, or pulmonary hemorrhage.

2. Pneumonia: The patient had right-sided consolidation on chest X-ray, which has now improved. However, no pathogens have been isolated. The patient is still receiving Vancomycin and Zosyn, and follow-up sputum culture and other microbiological tests are planned.

3. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a left lingular mass with spread to one of two lymph nodes sampled during bronchoscopy. Further recommendations are being sought from Dr. [Last Name (Title)]. Oncology and Radiation Oncology consults are needed to discuss treatment options for palliation and symptom control.

4. IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis): The patient is participating in the RECAP trial but has been unable to tolerate perfenidone due to illness and gastrointestinal side effects. IV steroids are being switched to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxia despite treatment with pneumonia (PNA). He has a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer and is currently being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is still requiring significant oxygen support and has worsening shortness of breath on presentation, which may be due to PNA, IPF exacerbation, or pulmonary hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's significant oxygen requirement and worsening SOB indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, and frequent reassessment of lung sounds are necessary to intervene promptly if there is a decline in respiratory function.

2. Pneumonia: Although the patient's pneumonia seems to be improving based on the consolidation seen on the chest X-ray, there is still a risk of complications such as worsening infection or development of antibiotic resistance. Continued monitoring of temperature, white blood cell count, and sputum culture results is essential to assess the progression of the infection.

3. Squamous cell lung cancer: The presence of a mass in the left lingular region with lymph node involvement indicates advanced lung cancer. The patient should be referred to an oncologist for further evaluation and discussion of treatment options for palliation and symptom control.

4. IPF exacerbation: As the patient has severe IPF, there is"

   continued hypoxemia
   .
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory failure
   Still with significant  O2 requirement. Worsening SOB on presentation
   may have been due to Pna, IPF exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage.
   - complete 10d course of vanc/zosyn
   - continue steroids to treat for IPF exacerbation
   - switch lasix to PO, goal net even to -500cc
   - goal to wean down O2 requirement where may be able to go to floor,
   not yet ready today
   # Pneumonia: R sided consolidation on CXR, now improved. No pathogens
   isolated. Passed speech and swallow eval.
   - continue vanc (d11) /zosyn (d9)
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   # Squamous cell lung CA: L lingular mass with spread to 1 of 2  lymph
   nodes sampled during bronch

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF, former smoker, and hypertension. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, pneumonia, squamous cell lung cancer, and agitation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 126/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. 

The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam), pantoprazole, lorazepam, and morphine sulfate. His recent blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, but normal creatinine levels. Other lab results indicate elevated glucose levels and altered electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, phosphorus).

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for dyspnea/respiratory failure, pneumonia, squamous cell lung cancer, and IPF exacerbation. The plan involves completing a 10-day course of Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam, continuing steroids for IPF exacerbation, switching from IV Lasix to PO, and gradually weaning down oxygen requirements.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to prolonged antibiotic use, further decline in lung function, and complications related to his underlying conditions"

   continued hypoxemia overnight requiring higher oxygen requirement of
   95%Fio2 on face mask.

   # Dyspnea/Respiratory failure: Still with significant O2 requirement.
   Worsening SOB on presentation may have been multifactorial with PNA and
   concomitant  IPF exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage.  Also has new
   diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer.
   - s/p 10d course of zosyn & will d/c tomorrow and will plan to d/c
   Vanco tomorrow as well ( day 12 today)
   - switch to PO steroids today, continue to taper as tolerates for IPF
   exacerbation
   - switch lasix to PO, goal -500cc to 1L negative
   - goal to wean down O2 requirement where may be able to go to floor,
   not yet ready today as needing high FiO2 FM
   - adding NAC to regimen
   # Pneumonia: R sided consolidation on CXR, now improved. No pathogens
   isolated. Passed speech and swallow evaluation.
   - continue vanc (d12), zosyn (d10)
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   # Squamous cell lung CA: L lingular mass with spread to 1 of 2  lymph
   nodes sampled during bronch
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recs
   - f/up Oncology and Rad/Onc consults regarding whether have treatment
   options for palliation, symptom control
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF (perfenidone)
   - switch IV to PO steroids

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of severe IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), HAP (Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia), and a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. He is currently in the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for failed extubation after a bronchoscopic procedure. The patient is experiencing hypoxia despite treatment with PNA (Presumably referring to Penicillin-type antibiotics), and his oxygen requirement has increased to 95% FiO2 on a face mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's significant oxygen requirement indicates ongoing respiratory failure. This may be due to the combination of PNA, IPF exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage, and the new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer.

2. Pneumonia: Although the patient's pneumonia has improved, there is still consolidation on the CXR (chest X-ray). There is a risk of relapse or development of drug-resistant organisms.

3. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer with spread to one of the lymph nodes sampled during bronchoscopy. Treatment options for palliation and symptom control need to be discussed with Oncology and Rad/Onc (Radiation Oncology) consultants.

4. IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis): The patient is enrolled in the RECAP trial for IPF, but has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with ongoing
   hypoxia despite treatment with PNA, found to have new squamous cell
   lung ca &  in MICU for failed extubation s/p bronch being treated for
   HAP and with continued hypoxemia overnight requiring higher oxygen
   requirement of 95%Fio2 on face mask.
   .
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory failure: Still with significant O2 requirement.
   Worsening SOB on presentation may have been multifactorial with PNA and
   concomitant  IPF exacerbation, & mild pulmonary hemorrhage.  Also has
   new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer.
   .
   -  will discontinue  zosyn (s/p 10 days) & discontinue vancomycin as
   well ( day 13 today)
   - will start  him on Cipro & Cefipime today given new CXR right sided
   question of infiltrate
   - continue PO steroids today, continue to taper as tolerates for IPF
   exacerbation
   - switch lasix to PO, goal -500cc to 1L negative
   - goal to wean down O2 requirement if can tolerate vs. movement toward
   comfort measures if worsens
   - continue NAC regimen
   # Pneumonia: R sided consolidation on CXR, now improved. No pathogens
   isolated. Passed speech and swallow evaluation.
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   - as above: will discontinue  zosyn (s/p 10 days) & discontinue
   vancomycin as well ( day 13 today)
   - will start  him on Cipro & Cefipime today given new CXR right sided
   question of infiltrate
   # Squamous cell lung CA: L lingular mass with spread to 1 of 2  lymph
   nodes sampled during bronch
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   - new family meeting for goals of care discussion today
   - consider palliative care update
   - will  hold off on Oncology and Rad/Onc consults for now  given rapid
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold  perfenidone
   - continue PO steroids
   .
   #Agitation:
   -continue PRN ativan & will plan to increase morphine dose today
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia:
   -Continue protonix

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. He presented with severe dyspnea and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He has been treated for HAP and is now experiencing continued hypoxemia despite treatment. He has also shown signs of worsening SOB, which may be due to IPF exacerbation and mild pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient has been placed on comfort measures and his code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe dyspnea and respiratory failure indicate a high risk of continued respiratory compromise. His hypoxemia requires ongoing oxygen support, and weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to his underlying lung conditions.
2. Pneumonia: Despite treatment for HAP, the patient has developed a new right-sided consolidation on CXR. This suggests ongoing or recurrent infection, which can further worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient's recent diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer indicates a progressive disease that may lead to further respiratory compromise and potential complications related to cancer spread or treatment.
4. IPF Exacerbation: The patient's IPF seems to be worsening, as evidenced by the need for increased oxygen support and the presence of diffuse crackles and coarse wheezes on"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP), and a new diagnosis of lung cancer. He presented with a stuffy nose and was given Flonase. The patient experienced desaturation and required an increased FiO2 from 60 to 95 to maintain oxygen saturation above 88%. He was then slowly weaned back to FiO2 60.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 03/30/2119 at 12:05 PM, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 04/01/2119 at 07:34 AM, vancomycin on 04/01/2119 at 08:00 PM, and piperacillin on 04/02/2119 at 12:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), morphine sulfate, and lorazepam (Ativan).

There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/72 to 136/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute"

   Still with significant O2 requirement. Worsening SOB on presentation
   may have been due to Pna, IPF exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage.
   - complete 10d course of zosyn today & will d/c tomorrow and will plan
   to d/c Vanco tomorrow as well ( day 12 today)
   - switch to PO steroids today, continue to taper as tolerates for IPF
   exacerbation
   - switch lasix to PO, goal -500cc to 1L negative
   - goal to wean down O2 requirement where may be able to go to floor,
   not yet ready today as needing high FiO2 FM
   - adding NAC to regimen
   # Pneumonia: R sided consolidation on CXR, now improved. No pathogens
   isolated. Passed speech and swallow evaluation.
   - continue vanc (d12), zosyn (d10)
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   # Squamous cell lung CA: L lingular mass with spread to 1 of 2  lymph
   nodes sampled during bronch

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to failed extubation after a bronchoscopy. The patient requires significant oxygen support and is experiencing worsening shortness of breath.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe hypoxemia and ongoing oxygen requirement indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Pneumonia: Although the patient's pneumonia appears to be improving, there is still a risk of complications such as superinfection or progression of the current infection. Continued surveillance and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.
3. Lung cancer: The presence of squamous cell lung cancer increases the risk of complications related to the tumor itself, as well as potential treatment-related side effects. Consultation with an oncology team will be crucial for further management.
4. IPF exacerbation: The patient's IPF may worsen due to the current respiratory insult. Proper management of the exacerbation, including corticosteroids and other supportive measures, is vital.
5. Agitation: The patient's agitation may require ongoing sedation and analgesia. Monitoring for signs of delirium or increased agitation is necessary.
6. GERD/hiatal hernia: The patient's underlying GER"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with hypoxia
   despite treatment with PNA, found to have new squamous cell lung ca &
   in MICU for failed extubation s/p bronch being treated for HAP and with
   continued hypoxemia
   .
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory failure
   Still with significant O2 requirement. Worsening SOB on presentation
   may have been due to Pna, IPF exacerbation, pulmonary hemorrhage.
   - complete 10d course of zosyn today & will d/c tomorrow and will plan
   to d/c Vanco tomorrow as well ( day 12 today)
   - switch to PO steroids today, continue to taper as tolerates for IPF
   exacerbation
   - switch lasix to PO, goal -500cc to 1L negative
   - goal to wean down O2 requirement where may be able to go to floor,
   not yet ready today as needing high FiO2 FM
   - adding NAC to regimen
   # Pneumonia: R sided consolidation on CXR, now improved. No pathogens
   isolated. Passed speech and swallow evaluation.
   - continue vanc (d12), zosyn (d10)
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   # Squamous cell lung CA: L lingular mass with spread to 1 of 2  lymph
   nodes sampled during bronch
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recs
   - f/up Oncology and Rad/Onc consults regarding whether have treatment
   options for palliation, symptom control
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold medications for IPF (perfenidone)
   - switch IV to PO steroids
   .
   #Agitation:
   -continue PRN ativan & morphine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with severe Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), Hypoxemia Associated Pneumonia (HAP), and a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and requires respiratory support with a high flow nasal cannula.

24-hour events include speaking with oncology regarding a formal consult, the patient experiencing stuffiness in the nose and requesting Flonase, and desaturation requiring an increase in FiO2 from 60 to 95 to maintain oxygen saturation above 88%. The patient was then able to be weaned slowly back to FiO2 60.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, and Piperacillin. He is also receiving other ICU medications such as Pantoprazole (Protonix), Morphine Sulfate, and Lorazepam (Ativan).

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.1°C (97%), heart rate 70 bpm (66-99), blood pressure 109/72 mmHg (104/52-136/79), respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute (18-31), oxygen saturation 92% on high"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M IPF, recent diagnosis squamous cell ca, in ICU with respiratory
   failure
    1. Respiratory failure: Likely post-obstructive PNA +/- IPF acute
   exacerbation. Clearly worse today.  Leukocytosis and R-sided CXR change
   suggestive of new infection vs accelerated IPF
   - Will meet with family and patient when they come in to discuss
   goals.  He has expressed desire to return home, however, it seems
   unlikely at this point that this is a realistic goal.
   - Continue high dose steroids for now.
   -Will broaden to cefepime and ciprofloxacin in addition to vanco
   - TBB target even to slightly negative.
   - patient not a current candidate for radiation therapy
   -Will continue with morphine and ativan for air hunger
     2. malignancy:
   -Palliative care consult if family wishes.  No need for heme-onc
   consult at present.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient's condition has worsened, indicating a likely post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) and/or an acute exacerbation of IPF. Leukocytosis and right-sided changes on chest X-ray suggest a new infection or accelerated IPF. 

The patient has expressed his desire to return home, but it seems unlikely at this point. High-dose steroids will be continued for now. The antibiotic regimen will be broadened to include cefepime and ciprofloxacin in addition to vancomycin. A target even slightly negative on the tuberculosis (TB) test will be pursued. The patient is not a current candidate for radiation therapy. Morphine and lorazepam will be continued for air hunger.

Palliative care consultation will be considered if the family wishes, as there is no need for a hematology-oncology consult at present. The rest of the plan is per the resident's note.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition remains in the ICU. The total time spent with the patient is 32 minutes, and he is critically ill."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M IPF, recent diagnosis squamous cell ca, in ICU with respiratory
   failure
    1. Respiratory failure: Likely post-obstructive PNA +/- IPF acute
   exacerbation. Clearly worse today.  Leukocytosis and R-sided CXR change
   suggestive of new infection vs accelerated IPF
   - Will meet with family and patient when they come in to discuss
   goals.  He has expressed desire to return home, however, it seems
   unlikely at this point that this is a realistic goal.
   - Continue high dose steroids for now.
   -Will broaden to cefepime and ciprofloxacin in addition to vanco
   - TBB target even to slightly negative.
   - patient not a current candidate for radiation therapy
   -Will continue with morphine and ativan for air hunger
     2. malignancy:
   -Palliative care consult if family wishes.  No need for heme-onc
   consult at present.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and a recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, likely caused by post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) and/or an acute exacerbation of IPF. The patient's condition has worsened, with leukocytosis and changes in his chest X-ray suggesting a possible new infection or accelerated IPF.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 120/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy with a fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 95% + 6L/min. An arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 35 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 21.6 K/uL.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, crackles throughout all lung fields, and the use of accessory muscles while at rest. He also has soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no peripheral edema or skin changes are noted. Neurologic examination is not performed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He was diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer and has been treated for pneumonia. Despite treatment, the patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to increased oxygen requirements and air hunger. The primary goal is to keep the patient comfortable while maintaining antibiotics. The patient's condition is multifactorial, including worsening right-sided infiltrate, and may not be reversible. Morphine has been titrated up to q1hr for respiratory distress, and lorazepam is given as needed. Contact has been made with the outpatient pulmonologist, and the patient will continue on vanc/cefepime/cipro antibiotics. A follow-up chest X-ray will be done, and the patient will continue on PO steroids. Social work involvement is planned to discuss palliative care with the family. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, requiring higher oxygen requirements and increased air hunger. This indicates a potential for respiratory failure due to worsening right-sided infiltrate, which may not be reversible.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right-sided consolidation on the chest X-ray, which indicates pneumonia. The antibiotics have been switched to cover for pseudomonas. There is a risk of ongoing infection or worsening of the pneumonia.
3. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a new"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), PNA (Pneumonia), and a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing worsening respiratory status despite multiple treatments. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status and continued hypoxemia suggest a high risk for respiratory failure. The patient is already using accessory muscles to breathe and has a low oxygen saturation level (SpO2: 93%). This indicates compromised respiratory function, which may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has a right-sided consolidation on the chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. The worsening of consolidation in the last 48 hours suggests a possible spread of pneumonia or worsening of underlying IPF. This increases the risk of further respiratory deterioration and potentially leading to sepsis.

3. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. Given his current status and worse hypoxia, he may not be a candidate for aggressive treatments like radiation therapy (XRT) or chemotherapy. This increases the risk of disease progression and potential complications associated with advanced lung cancer.

4. IPF Exacerbation: The patient's worsening respiratory status could be due to an exacerbation of IPF. IPF is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF, PNA, and newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer. He is experiencing continued hypoxemia despite multiple treatments. The patient's condition has worsened, with increased air hunger and the need for higher oxygen requirements. The main goal is to keep the patient comfortable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status and increased oxygen requirement indicate a potential risk for respiratory failure. This could be due to underlying IPF, worsened right-sided infiltrate, and underlying lung cancer.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has right-sided consolidation on the chest X-ray, which has worsened over the past 48 hours. Antibiotics have been switched to cover for pseudomonas. There is a risk of further progression of pneumonia.
3. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient is not a candidate for XRT/chemo due to his current status. This increases the risk of disease progression and spread.
4. IPF: The patient is enrolled in the RECAP trial but has been unable to tolerate perfinodone due to illness and GI side effects. This puts him at risk for further decline in lung function.
5. Agitation: The patient is experiencing increased agitation, which may require adjustment of medication such as morphine and ativan.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), PNA (Pneumonia), and newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer. Despite multiple treatments, the patient continues to experience hypoxemia. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to increased oxygen requirement and air hunger. The primary goal is to keep the patient comfortable, while maintaining antibiotics. The patient's family has been informed about the worsening status and has declined further oncology treatment workup. The patient is DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate), and the focus is on providing palliative care and support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, and there may be a risk of respiratory failure due to worsened consolidation on the right side of the lung, which may not be reversible.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia with worsening consolidation on the CXR (chest X-ray) in the last 48 hours. Antibiotics have been changed to cover for pseudomonas, but there is a risk of complications if the infection does not improve.
3. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. Due to the patient's current status, he is not a candidate for XRT (radiation therapy) or chemotherapy. There is a risk of disease progression and associated complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He was admitted to the MICU for failed extubation after a bronchoscopic procedure and is being treated for HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia). The patient continues to require high levels of oxygen supplementation, currently on 95% FiO2 via face mask. He has new squamous cell lung cancer and worsening shortness of breath due to multifactorial causes including PNA, concomitant IPF exacerbation, and mild pulmonary hemorrhage.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Dyspnea/Respiratory failure: The patient still has significant O2 requirements. Worsening SOB on presentation may be multifactorial with PNA and concomitant IPF exacerbation, as well as mild pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient also has a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer.

- Discontinue Zosyn (after 10 days) and vancomycin (day 13 today).
- Start Cipro and Cefepime today given new CXR right-sided question of infiltrate.
- Continue PO steroids today, tapering as tolerated for IPF exacerbation.
- Switch lasix to PO, aiming for -500cc to 1L negative.
- Goal to wean down O2 requirement if tolerating, otherwise moving towards comfort measures if worsens.
- Continue NAC regimen.

2. Pneumonia: Right-sided consolidation on CXR, now improved. No pathogens isolated. Follow-up sputum culture, other micro, and CIS. As above, discontinue Zosyn (after 10 days) and vancomycin (day 13 today). Start Cipro and Cefepime today given new CXR right-sided question of infiltrate.

3. Squamous cell lung CA: Left lingular mass with spread to one of two lymph nodes sampled during bronch. Follow-up with Dr. [Last Name (STitle)]. New family meeting for goals of care discussion today. Consider palliative care update. Hold off on Oncology and Rad/Onc consults for now given rapid decline.

4. IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Unable to tolerate perfinodone recently due to illness and trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects. Continue to hold perfinodone. Continue PO steroids.

5. Agitation: Continue PRN ativan and plan to increase morphine dose today.

6. GERD/hiatal hernia: Continue protonix.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: NPO other than sips for comfort. O2 desaturations with any removal of face mask.
- Glycemic Control:
- Lines: PICC Line - [2119-3-27] 11:00 AM.
- Prophylaxis: DVT - Pneumoboots, Stress ulcer - PPI, VAP - [no specific mention].

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to ongoing hypoxemia and pneumonia, further deterioration of lung function in the context of IPF exacerbation, potential spread or progression of squamous cell lung cancer, and ongoing agitation which may require increased pain management."

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure: likely [**1-17**] IPF, but would consider aspiration,
   volume overload and SCC as potential contributors.  Currently with
   increased O2 requirement and need for increased morphine and ativan for
   symptom management.
    - will cont vanc/cipro/cefepeme
    - will increase CS to solumedrol 80 [**Hospital1 7**]
    - NPO for now
    - Cont diuresis
    - family meeting this morning regarding overall goals of care given
   his poor prognosis, currently remains DNR/DNI
   2. Sinus congestion: cont flonase and sudaphed
   3. Cough: cont guafenesin
   4. Pain/discomfort: cont morphine/ativan
   5. FEN: NPO for now, cont PPI for reflux
   6. Goals of care: family meeting today to discuss overall goals

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) who initially presented with CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia) requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient developed hemoptysis while in the house and had a bronchoscopy that identified SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) in the left lingula.
- Overnight, the patient's oxygen requirement increased, and there was an increased need for morphine.
- The patient previously expressed his desire to go home with hospice, but due to the increased oxygen requirement, it may not be possible.
- Antibiotic coverage was broadened yesterday for possible progression of pneumonia.
- The patient is currently on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support, with an SpO2 of 93% and ABG results of ///35.
- Physical examination shows crackles throughout the lungs, right lower extremity edema (absent), left lower extremity edema (absent), cyanosis, muscle wasting, warm skin, and attentive with normal tone.
- Lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct and Plt, slightly elevated Cr, and normal glucose levels.
- The patient's overall prognosis is poor, and he remains DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate).

He continues to experience hypoxemia despite multiple treatments including antibiotics, steroids, nebulizers, and oxygen therapy. The patient has been consulted with palliative care and started on PRN (Pro Re Nata) PO morphine.

24-hour events include the administration of various antibiotics and initiation of ICU medications such as morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and lorazepam. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/65 to 143/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm remains sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,030 mL total with 286 mL given intravenously, and an output of 2,470 mL including 445 mL through urine. The patient's respiratory support consists of high flow nebulization with an oxygen delivery device, and the latest ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) results are not provided.

Physical examination findings include elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating within the normal"

   68 year-old man with IPF, former smoker, and hypertension with new
   diagnosis squamous cell lung cancer with continued hypoxemia despite
   treatment for PNA, IPF, diuresis with worsened respiratory status
   overnight requiring higher oxygen requirement and increased air hunger
   with main goal of comfort now
   .
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory failure: Worsened O2 requirement with
   desaturations with any removal of face mask. Still multifactorial
   causes for his worse WOB and hypoxia, including IPF,  worsened R sided
   infiltrate and underlying lung cancer.  Family discussions ongoing but
   primary goal to keep patient comfortable
 still maintaining
   antibiotics.
   .
   - titrated up morphine to Q1hr and also with PRN Ativan for respiratory
   distress
   - contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **], outpatient pulmonologist to touch base on
   recent decline x 48 hrs
   - continue Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro
   - continue nebs
   - f/u AM CXR today for interval changes
   - will switch back to IV Solumedrol today from PO Prednisone
   - continue supporting family /meeting today
 social work involved, can
   talk to family regarding palliative care additions
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Patient has a right sided consolidation on CXR, worsened
   in last 48 hrs with no pathogens isolated. Unclear if new PNA spread or
   IPF. Antibiotics switched with aim for double coverage for pseudomonas
   - follow up sputum culture, other micro and CIS
   - continue vanc/cefepime/cipro for now
   - f/u CXR as above
   .
   # Squamous cell lung CA: Discussed with family that patient not
   candidate for XRT/chemo given current status and worse hypoxia.
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   - consider palliative care consult
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold  perfenidone
   - will switch back to IV steroids today
   .
   #nasal congestion: Improving now
   -will continue nasal saline, flonase
   .
   #Agitation:
   -continue PRN ativan & will plan to increase morphine dose today

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), PNA (Pneumonia), and newly diagnosed squamous cell lung cancer. He continues to experience hypoxemia despite multiple treatments. The patient has been consulted with palliative care and started on PRN PO morphine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status and increased oxygen requirement indicate a risk of respiratory failure due to underlying lung cancer, worsened right-sided infiltrate, and IPF.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a right-sided consolidation on CXR, which has worsened in the last 48 hours. The lack of pathogens isolated suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Antibiotics have been switched for double coverage against pseudomonas.
3. Squamous cell lung cancer: The patient is not a candidate for XRT/chemo due to his current status and worse hypoxia. Palliative care consult should be considered.
4. IPF: The patient has been unable to tolerate perfinodone in the RECAP trial due to illness and GI side effects. IV steroids will be switched back today.
5. Nasal congestion: Improving now but will continue nasal saline and Flonase.
6. Agitation: Will continue PRN ativan and plan to increase morphine dose today.
7. GERD/hiatal hernia: Continue Protonix.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF, PNA, and new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. He continues to have hypoxemia despite multiple treatments. The patient has been started on palliative care and has been given PRN morphine for pain management. He is currently on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support. His vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/65 to 143/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Physical examination reveals coarse rhonchi bilaterally and anteriorly, pale appearance, fatigue, and the use of accessory muscles to breathe. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 21.2 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 38.5 g/dL, and slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient's main goal is comfort, and he is currently being treated for dyspnea/respiratory failure, pneumonia, squamous cell lung cancer, and IPF. He is also receiving treatment for nasal congestion, agitation, and GERD/hiatal hernia. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) code status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), PNA (Pneumonia), and new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. He has been experiencing continued hypoxemia despite multiple treatments. The patient's condition has worsened overnight, requiring higher oxygen requirement and increased air hunger. The main goal of care is now comfort-focused.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status, including hypoxemia and increased air hunger, suggests a high risk for respiratory failure. Continued hypoxemia can lead to further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. Pneumonia: The patient initially had pneumonia, and although antibiotics have been discontinued, there is still a possibility of ongoing or recurrent infection. This can contribute to worsening respiratory status and hypoxemia.

3. Squamous cell lung cancer: The new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer poses a risk for complications such as metastasis, bleeding, and obstruction of the airways.

4. IPF: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is a chronic, progressive lung disease that can lead to worsening lung function over time. The patient's IPF may contribute to his respiratory symptoms and overall decline.

5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has a history of GERD/hiatal hernia, which can cause discomfort and potential aspiration risks. The use of morphine for pain control may also increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a new diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). He was initially admitted with pneumonia (pna) and developed hemoptysis. A bronchoscopy revealed an obstructing mass at the lingula, which was biopsied and lasered. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely due to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), but other potential contributors like aspiration, volume overload, and SCC are also considered. 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly low temperature, normal blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and slightly low oxygen saturation. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for respiratory support with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 95% and maintaining a SpO2 of 97%. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) increasing from 14.1 to 21.6 thousand cells/microliter, an elevated hematocrit (Hct) level, and stable platelet count (Plt). Renal function tests show a stable creatinine level, while glucose levels vary within normal limits. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos)/total bilirubin (T Bili), and electrolytes are within normal range or show no significant changes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who was initially admitted with pneumonia. He developed hemoptysis and underwent a bronchoscopy, which revealed an obstructing mass at the lingula that was biopsied and lasered. The biopsy results indicated a new diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The patient has been experiencing persistent hypoxia on 95% fraction of inspired oxygen (FM) for 48 hours. The patient's condition is deteriorating, with increased oxygen requirements and the need for increased doses of morphine and lorazepam for symptom management. The attending physician and ICU fellow agree with the assessment and plan outlined below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to IPF, but other potential contributors include pneumonia, aspiration, volume overload, and SCC. The increased oxygen requirement suggests worsening respiratory status.
2. Pain/discomfort: The patient is experiencing pain and discomfort, which is being managed with morphine and lorazepam.
3. Feeding and nutrition: The patient's diet should be resumed as tolerated.
4. Goals of care: The focus is shifting towards comfort measures, indicating that curative treatments may no longer be pursued, and the emphasis is on symptom management and quality of life.

   # Dyspnea/Respiratory failure: Worsened O2 requirement with
   desaturations with any removal of face mask. Still multifactorial
   causes for his worse WOB and hypoxia, including IPF, worsened R sided
   infiltrate and underlying lung cancer.  Family discussions ongoing but
   primary goal to keep patient comfortable
 still maintaining
   antibiotics.

   respiratory distress / night time sleep
   - continue nebs
   - will continue on  IV Solumedrol today and furosemide
 will discuss
   with family again today
   - goal is hospice, focus on comfort
 will eval for O2 delivery options
   at home

   # Squamous cell lung CA: Discussed with family that patient not
   candidate for XRT/chemo given current status and worse hypoxia.
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   - palliative care involved
   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.
   - continue to hold  perfenidone
   - continue steroids

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF, former smoker, hypertension, and new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is currently on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. His main goal is comfort, and family discussions are ongoing. The patient's condition has worsened overnight, requiring higher oxygen requirements and increased air hunger. He continues to experience dyspnea and desaturations when the face mask is removed. The causes of his worsened work of breathing and hypoxia are multifactorial, including IPF, worsened right-sided infiltrate, and underlying lung cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, and he requires higher oxygen requirements. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if his hypoxemia does not improve.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to have desaturations despite treatment. This indicates inadequate oxygenation of tissues and may lead to organ damage if not addressed promptly.
3. Increased Air Hunger: The patient's increased air hunger suggests impending respiratory failure. It is crucial to manage his symptoms and provide adequate oxygenation to prevent further deterioration.
4. Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: The patient has a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. Without appropriate treatment, the cancer may progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
5. IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fib"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He has a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer and is experiencing worsening respiratory status despite treatment for pneumonia, IPF, and diuresis. The patient's main goal is to maintain comfort, and the focus is on providing palliative care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea/Respiratory failure: The patient's worsened O2 requirement and desaturations indicate a potential complication related to respiratory failure. This can be attributed to multifactorial causes such as IPF, worsened right-sided infiltrate, and underlying lung cancer.

2. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which may be due to discomfort or distress caused by his respiratory condition. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's agitation is necessary to ensure his comfort and prevent any further complications.

3. Oral thrush: The presence of oral thrush suggests a potential infection in the patient's mouth. It is important to continue Nystatin coverage to prevent the spread of infection and ensure the patient's comfort.

4. Nasal congestion: Although improving, the patient had nasal congestion, which could be caused by various factors including allergies, infection, or other underlying conditions. Monitoring the patient's symptoms and providing appropriate treatment to alleviate nasal congestion is important.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to have hypoxemia despite oxygen therapy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He has a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer. The patient's main goal now is comfort, and the focus is on providing palliative care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status, hypoxemia, and increased air hunger suggest a potential complication of respiratory failure. This could be due to IPF, worsened right-sided infiltrate, and underlying lung cancer.
2. Dyspnea: The patient's increased air hunger and requirement for higher oxygen indicate potential dyspnea, which can be a symptom of underlying conditions such as IPF, lung cancer, or respiratory failure.
3. Infection: Although antibiotics have been discontinued, there is a risk of ongoing or recurrent infections, especially considering the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of a central line.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The platelet count has been fluctuating, indicating potential thrombocytopenia. Monitoring for signs"

   causes for his worse WOB and hypoxia, including IPF, worsened R sided
   infiltrate and underlying lung cancer.  Family discussions ongoing but
   primary goal to keep patient comfortable
 still maintaining
   antibiotics.
   - continue on morphine 5-10mg Q2hr PRN and also with PRN Ativan for
   respiratory distress / night time sleep
   - continue nebs
   - antibiotics discontinued this AM
   - will continue on  IV Solumedrol today
   - goal is hospice, focus on comfort, touch base with palliative care,
   CM regarding oxygen possibilities at home

   # Squamous cell lung CA: Discussed with family that patient not
   candidate for XRT/chemo given current status and worse hypoxia.
   - f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

   .
   # IPF: Followed by pulmonary, currently in the RECAP trial. Has been
   unable to tolerate the perfenidone recently given his illness and
   trouble tolerating antibiotics as well due to GI side effects.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF, former smoker, and hypertension, who has been diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with worsening respiratory status and hypoxemia despite treatment for pneumonia, IPF, and diuresis. The main goal of care is now focused on comfort. The patient continues to require higher levels of oxygen and experiences increased air hunger. Multifactorial causes for his worsened work of breathing and hypoxia include IPF, worsening right-sided infiltrate, and underlying lung cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, and he requires increased levels of oxygen. This indicates a risk of respiratory failure due to underlying lung diseases such as IPF and lung cancer.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to experience hypoxemia despite treatment. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
3. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which may be due to the underlying lung cancer or other factors. It is important to manage this symptom to ensure patient comfort.
4. Sedation: The patient's fear of being too sedated to interact with family may pose a challenge in increasing the dose of morphine for pain and agitation control.
5. GI side effects: The patient has trouble tolerating antibiotics due to GI side effects, which could potentially lead to infection control issues.
6. Code status: The patient has a DNR/DNI status and is moving towards comfort measures only (CMO). This indicates a shift in focus from curative measures to palliative care, prioritizing patient comfort.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of respiratory status, pain, agitation, and potential complications associated with his underlying conditions. Palliative care measures should be continued to support the patient's comfort and quality of life."

","The patient is a 68-year-old man with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), former smoker, and hypertension. He has a new diagnosis of squamous cell lung cancer and continues to have hypoxemia despite treatment for pneumonia, IPF, and diuresis. His respiratory status worsened overnight, requiring higher oxygen requirement and increased air hunger. The main goal now is to keep the patient comfortable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status and hypoxemia indicate a high risk for respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Despite discontinuing antibiotics, the patient is still at risk for infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection or inflammation. Close monitoring of other organ functions, such as renal and hepatic function, is necessary.
4. Increased sedation: The increased dose of morphine for agitation may lead to excessive sedation and reduced interaction with family members.
5. GI side effects: The patient's intolerance to antibiotics due to GI side effects may continue if he is given any medications that have similar effects.
6. Oral thrush: The patient's ongoing Nystatin coverage indicates an existing oral thrush infection, which needs to be monitored and treated appropriately.
7. Agitation: The patient's agitation requires close monitoring, and adjustments in medication doses need to be made carefully to balance"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) initially admitted with pneumonia. He has developed hemoptysis and an obstructing mass at the lingula of the lung was found during bronchoscopy. The mass was biopsied and lasered, revealing a new diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The patient has persistent hypoxia despite being on 95% FiO2 for 48 hours.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent hypoxia, increased oxygen requirement, and need for increased morphine and ativan suggest a high likelihood of respiratory failure. Potential contributors may include IPF, pneumonia, aspiration, volume overload, and SCC.
2. Infection: The patient has been receiving various antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin) which indicates a concern for infection. The decision to discontinue antibiotics (per GOC discussions) suggests that the current infection is being managed.
3. Pain/discomfort: The patient is on continuous morphine and ativan for symptom management, indicating ongoing pain and discomfort.
4. Feeding intolerance: The patient's diet is being resumed, but no specific issues with feeding have been mentioned.
5. Goals of care: The patient's goals of care are shifting"

   Assessment and Plan
   68M patient of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 453**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2**] w IPF, initially admitted with pna,
   developed hemoptysis and had bronchoscopy by IP which revealed
   obstructing mass at lingula which was biopsied and lasered. Found to be
   new diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Persistent hypoxia on 95% FM
   and 6L NC. Moving toward comfort measures. Main goal is to get him home
   if at all possible.
    #. Respiratory failure: Likely [**1-17**] IPF, but pneumonia, aspiration,
   volume overload and SCC are potential contributors.  Currently with
   increased O2 requirement and need for increased morphine and ativan for
   symptom management.
    - Per GOC discussions, no further CXR, nebs, abxs, or blood draws.
    - Continue solumedrol for now.  Will discuss further with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2**]
   and family/patient.
   #. Pain/discomfort: Cont morphine/ativan per patient wishes.
   #. FEN: Diet as tolerated
   #. Goals of care: Moving towards focus on comfort. Working on arranging
   home oxygen at the level he needs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of IPF (Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis), initially admitted with pneumonia. He developed hemoptysis and underwent a bronchoscopy, which revealed an obstructing mass at the lingula that was biopsied and lasered. The biopsy results indicated a new diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The patient is currently experiencing persistent hypoxia despite being on 95% FiO2 and 6L NC (nasal cannula). The main goal is to provide comfort measures and potentially get him home if possible.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying IPF, as well as potential contributions from pneumonia, aspiration, volume overload, and SCC. His increased O2 requirement and need for increased morphine and ativan for symptom management suggest worsening respiratory status.
2. Pain/Discomfort: The patient is experiencing pain and discomfort, for which he is receiving morphine and ativan per his wishes.
3. Feeding and Eating: The patient is on a diet as tolerated.
4. Goals of Care: The focus is shifting towards comfort care, and efforts are being made to arrange home oxygen at the level he needs.
5. Other ICU Care: The patient has a PICC line in place, and prophylaxis for DVT (deep vein thrombosis) has been declined. Stress ulcer prophylaxis"
