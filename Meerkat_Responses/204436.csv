   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 y/o M with DMI, ESRD who presents with bleeding
   during bronch done for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse
   ground glass infiltrates.
   Transient Massive Hemoptysis During Bronch: likely source of bleeding
   was identified during flex bronch, the patient coughed and had
   resultant bleeding. Of note patient had DES 5 months prior and is on
   ASa/Plavix. etiologies of the bleed include AVM, clot from previous
   bronch in setting of anticoagulation although doesnt appear same lobe,
   vasculitis, CA (although not visualized on CT) possibly carcinoid, HTN
   also likely contributed. Also considering trauma and infection.
   - Keep patient sedated overnight with propfol
   - cough suppressants following to prevent clot from dislodging
   - should patient rebleed, push ET tube into right bronchus and turn
   patient left side down.
   - DDAVP given on ASA/plavix
   - CXR now, and daily
   - keep plavix for now
   Ground Glass Opacities: these have worsened since previous CT in
   [**Month (only) **]. Differential  inculdes vasculitis, possibly goodpastures or
   wegeners given concurrent kidney disease. Also possible infectious, may
   be PCP (although no risk factors), viral possible, atypical, fungal.
   Also may be beginning of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis. Considering drug toxicity, but no known exposures to drugs
   known to cause pulm issues. Most likely in this patient given
   hemosiderin laiden macrophages and high wedges and hypertension is
   heart failure related intersticial process.
   - For vasculitic processes: f/u anti GBP, ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **].
   - RF , CRP, ESR: all elevated
   - f/u BAL for infectious etiology
   - treat htn and recheck CT scan after hemodynamically controleld for
   several weeks.
   - check ttg for [**Male First Name (un) 1295**]-[**Location (un) 1296**] Syndrome
    Respiratory: on AC, last gas from OR alkalemic: patient alkalemic, but
   with normal PCO2 and bicarb.
   - will keep on AC overnight
   - recheck gas, adjust as necessary
    HTN: running high on floor as well, will try to keep goal BP 150 for
   now.
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 284**], Metoprolol, nifedipine, lisinopril, isorbide
   mononitrate-- switched to short acting, because long acting is not
   crushable.
   - PRN hydral as needed overnight has HTN will exacerbate bleed
    CAD: recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**].
   - continue Atorvastatin 80mg, Zetia, Losartan, Metoprolol, nifedipine,
   isosorbide monitrate and lisinoprol.
   - continue ASA and plavix.
   DMI: continue home doses, half standing while NPO
   ESRD: MWF, appears euvolemic at present.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of depression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and recent coronary artery disease (CAD) treatment including a drug-eluting stent (DES) placement in the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient presents with bleeding during a bronchoscopic procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates on CT scan.

The assessment and plan include several potential causes for the bleeding, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), clot from previous bronchoscopic procedure in the setting of anticoagulation, vasculitis, cancer (possibly carcinoid), hypertension, trauma, and infection. The patient is kept sedated overnight with propofol, cough suppressants are given to prevent clot dislodgement, and the endotracheal tube (ETT) is positioned into the right bronchus and the patient is turned left side down in case of rebleeding.

Regarding the ground glass opacities seen on CT scan, the differential diagnosis includes vasculitis, possibly Goodpasture's or Wegener's syndrome given the concurrent kidney disease. Other possible causes include infectious etiology (PCP), viral, atypical, or fungal infection, beginning of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug toxicity, and heart failure-related interstitial process. Further investigations, such as anti-GBP and ANCA tests, BAL analysis for infectious etiology,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of depression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and recent drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation for coronary artery disease (CAD). He presents with bleeding during a bronchoscopic procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates on chest X-ray. The source of bleeding was identified as a possible duodenal ulcer, but other potential causes include arteriovenous malformation (AVM), clot from previous bronchial intervention, vasculitis, cancer (possibly carcinoid), hypertension, trauma, or infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Massive Hemoptysis: The patient experienced significant bleeding during the bronchoscopic procedure, which could lead to respiratory distress and hypoxemia.
2. Duodenal Ulcer Bleeding: The identified source of bleeding may continue to cause gastrointestinal bleeding if left untreated.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and further episodes of hypotension could compromise organ perfusion.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: Given the patient's pre-existing ESRD, any additional insult to renal function, such as hypotension or medication toxicity, could result in acute kidney injury.
5. Pneumonia: The ground glass opacities on the chest X-ray could indicate an infectious process, potentially leading to pneumonia if not appropriately managed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 y/o M with DMI, ESRD who presents with bleeding
   during bronch done for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse
   ground glass infiltrates.
   Transient Massive Hemoptysis During Bronch: likely source of bleeding
   was identified during flex bronch, the patient coughed and had
   resultant bleeding. Of note patient had DES 5 months prior and is on
   ASa/Plavix. etiologies of the bleed include AVM, clot from previous
   bronch in setting of anticoagulation although doesnt appear same lobe,
   vasculitis, CA (although not visualized on CT) possibly carcinoid, HTN
   also likely contributed. Also considering trauma and infection.
   - Keep patient sedated overnight with propfol
   - cough suppressants following to prevent clot from dislodging
   - should patient rebleed, push ET tube into right bronchus and turn
   patient left side down.
   - DDAVP given on ASA/plavix
   - CXR now, and daily
   - keep plavix for now
   Ground Glass Opacities: these have worsened since previous CT in
   [**Month (only) **]. Differential  inculdes vasculitis, possibly goodpastures or
   wegeners given concurrent kidney disease. Also possible infectious, may
   be PCP (although no risk factors), viral possible, atypical, fungal.
   Also may be beginning of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis. Considering drug toxicity, but no known exposures to drugs
   known to cause pulm issues. Most likely in this patient given
   hemosiderin laiden macrophages and high wedges and hypertension is
   heart failure related intersticial process.
   - For vasculitic processes: f/u anti GBP, ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **].
   - RF , CRP, ESR: all elevated
   - f/u BAL for infectious etiology
   - treat htn and recheck CT scan after hemodynamically controleld for
   several weeks.
   - check ttg for [**Male First Name (un) 1295**]-[**Location (un) 1296**] Syndrome
    Respiratory: on AC, last gas from OR alkalemic: patient alkalemic, but
   with normal PCO2 and bicarb.
   - will keep on AC overnight
   - recheck gas, adjust as necessary
    HTN: running high on floor as well, will try to keep goal BP 150 for
   now.
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 284**], Metoprolol, nifedipine, lisinopril, isorbide
   mononitrate-- switched to short acting, because long acting is not
   crushable.
   - PRN hydral as needed overnight has HTN will exacerbate bleed
    CAD: recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**].
   - continue Atorvastatin 80mg, Zetia, Losartan, Metoprolol, nifedipine,
   isosorbide monitrate and lisinoprol.
   - continue ASA and plavix.
   DMI: continue home doses, half standing while NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of depression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and recent drug-eluting stent (DES) placement for coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with bleeding during a bronchoscopic procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension (HTN), which likely contributed to the bleeding. Other potential sources of bleeding include arterial venous malformation (AVM), clot from a previous bronchoscopic procedure in the setting of anticoagulation, vasculitis, cancer (possibly carcinoid), and trauma. The patient is currently receiving sedation, cough suppressants, and DDAVP to prevent clotting. A chest X-ray has been ordered, and daily X-rays will be continued. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to massive hemoptysis and subsequent hypovolemic shock.
2. Pneumonia or respiratory infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
3. Development of further bleeding episodes, especially if anticoagulation therapy is continued.
4. Progression of ground glass opacities and worsening respiratory function.
5. Cardiac complications related to underlying CAD and hypertension.
6. Renal dysfunction or worsening of ESRD.
7. Thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 48 year old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus, ESRD on
   dialysiswho presents with bleeding during bronch done for persistent
   hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates.
   Transient Massive Hemoptysis During Bronch: likely source of bleeding
   was identified during flex bronch, IP thinks it may be a dulefoys
   ulcer, although these are usually seen in GI tract.   Of note patient
   had DES 5 months prior and is on ASa/Plavix. etiologies of the bleed
   include AVM, clot from previous bronch in setting of anticoagulation
   although doesnt appear same lobe, vasculitis, CA (although not
   visualized on CT) possibly carcinoid, HTN also likely contributed. Also
   considering trauma and infection.
   - Keep patient sedated overnight with propfol
   - cough suppressants following to prevent clot from dislodging
   - should patient rebleed, push ET tube into right bronchus and turn
   patient left side down.
   - DDAVP given on ASA/plavix
   - CXR now, and daily
   - keep plavix for now, discontinue ASA
   - IP to rebronch today, will f/u results
   - Will call IR to make aware he may need embolization if he bleeds
   Ground Glass Opacities: these have worsened since previous CT in
   [**Month (only) **]. Differential  inculdes vasculitis, possibly goodpastures or
   wegeners given concurrent kidney disease. Also possible infectious, may
   be PCP (although no risk factors), viral possible, atypical, fungal.
   Also may be beginning of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis. Considering drug toxicity, but no known exposures to drugs
   known to cause pulm issues. Most likely in this patient given
   hemosiderin laiden macrophages and high wedges and hypertension is
   heart failure related interstitial process.
   - For vasculitic processes: f/u anti GBP, ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **].
   - RF , CRP, ESR: all elevated
   - f/u BAL for infectious etiology
   - treat htn and recheck CT scan after hemodynamically controlled for
   several weeks.
   - check ttg for [**Male First Name (un) 1295**]-[**Location (un) 1296**] Syndrome
    Respiratory: on AC, last gas from OR alkalemic: patient alkalemic, but
   with normal PCO2 and bicarb.
   - will keep on AC, decrease RR 14
 10, as likely usually hypercarbic
   - recheck gas, adjust as necessary
    HTN: running high on floor as well, will try to keep goal BP 150 for
   now.
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 284**], Metoprolol, nifedipine, lisinopril, isorbide
   mononitrate-- switched to short acting, because long acting is not
   crushable.
   - PRN hydral as needed overnight has HTN will exacerbate bleed
    CAD: recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**].
   - continue Atorvastatin 80mg, Zetia, Losartan, Metoprolol, nifedipine,
   isosorbide monitrate and lisinoprol.
   - hold ASA and continue plavix.
   DMI: continue home doses, half standing while NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on dialysis. He presents with bleeding during a bronchoscopic procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates. The likely source of bleeding was identified during flex bronch as a duodenal ulcer, although these are usually seen in the GI tract. Other potential etiologies of the bleed include arteriovenous malformation (AVM), clot from previous bronchoscopic procedure in the setting of anticoagulation, vasculitis, cancer (possibly carcinoid), hypertension, trauma, and infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient experienced a massive hemoptysis during the bronchoscopic procedure, and there is a risk of re-bleeding. Measures such as keeping the patient sedated overnight with propofol, cough suppressants to prevent clot from dislodging, and pushing the ET tube into the right bronchus and turning the patient left side down should be considered if the patient rebleeds.
2. Infection: The presence of worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates raises concern for an infectious etiology, such as pneumonia or atypical infection. Further follow-up with BAL for infectious etiology is planned.
3. Vasculitis: Elevated levels of RF, CRP, and ESR suggest a possible vasculitic process. Follow-up anti-GBM, ANCA, and rhe"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 48 year old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus, ESRD on
   dialysiswho presents with bleeding during bronch done for persistent
   hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates.
   #) Transient Massive Hemoptysis During Bronch:
   Overnight, one episode of coughing with bright red blood, dried clot
   noted in ETT. As noted previously, likely source of bleeding was
   identified during flex bronch, IP team feels it may be a dulefoys
   ulcer, although these are usually seen in GI tract.   Of note patient
   had DES 5 months prior and is on ASA/Plavix. Other etiologies of the
   bleed include AVM, clot from previous bronch in setting of
   anticoagulation although doesnt appear same lobe, vasculitis, CA
   (although not visualized on CT) possibly carcinoid, HTN also likely
   contributed. Also considering trauma and infection.
   - Given episode of hemoptysis overnight with single episode of
   coughing, will hold off on extubation for one additional day and
   continue sedation and cough suppression. Per IP team, airways appeared
   overall clean yesterday.
   - Should patient re-bleed, plan is to push ET tube into right bronchus
   and turn patient left side down, call IP and IR urgently.
   - DDAVP given on ASA/plavix, end-stage renal disease with uremic
   platelets
   - CXR daily.
   - Per renal team, may benefit from a bleeding perspective with blood
   transfusion, so giving one unit of PRBCs.
   - As noted with discussion with cardiology, will stop plavix and
   continue full strength aspirin.
   - Major concern is re-bleed should patient cough
given hemoptysis
   overnight with cough, and again this morning with some blood when
   coughing, will remain sedated and intubated today and plan to extubate
   tomorrow if no evidence of on-going bleeding.
   - IR and CT surgery aware of patient should IP team not be able to
   control bleeding.
   - Serologies as noted above.
   .
   #) Ground Glass Opacities: These have worsened since previous CT in
   [**Month (only) 270**]. Differential  inculdes vasculitis, possibly goodpastures or
   wegeners given concurrent kidney disease. Also possible infectious, may
   be PCP (although no risk factors), viral possible, atypical, fungal.
   Also may be beginning of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis. Considering drug toxicity, but no known exposures to drugs
   known to cause pulm issues. Most likely in this patient given
   hemosiderin laiden macrophages and high wedges and hypertension is
   heart failure related interstitial process.
   - For vasculitic processes: ANCA negative, Anti-GBM pending, ACA
   pending, TTG pending.
   - RF , CRP, ESR: all elevated
   - No growth of culture data from BAL.
   - Will continue to treat hypertension and re-check CT scan after
   hemodynamically controlled for several weeks.
   - TTG pending for [**Male First Name (un) 1367**]-[**Location (un) 1296**] Syndrome
   #)  Respiratory: Patient remains on AC, last gas demonstrates
   alkalosis, suspect patient is usually hypercarbic given obesity (and
   likely hypoventilation) and OSA, but with normal PCO2 and bicarb.
   - Rate decreased to 10 this AM, will re-check.
   - Recheck gas, adjust as necessary
   #)  HTN: Overall improved control, but systolic to 180 this morning
   prior to medications. Goal SBP <150 for now.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 284**], Metoprolol, lisinopril, isorbide mononitrate-- switched
   to short acting, because long acting is not crushable. Nifedipine on
   hold as no appropriate short-acting (crushable) alternative is
   available.
   - PRN hydral as needed overnight has HTN will exacerbate bleed
    #) CAD: recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**].
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg, Zetia, Losartan, Metoprolol, nifedipine,
   isosorbide monitrate and lisinoprol.
   - Appreciate cardiology assistance: Stopping plavix in light of
   significant bleeding, continuing ASA 325 mg.
   #) DMI: Patient was persistently hypoglycemic yesterday in setting of
   receiving full dose of NPH, renal failure, and NPO status. Monitoring
   frequent finger sticks (1-2 hours), and will initiate insulin drip once
   FSBG above 120-140.
   .
   #) ESRD: MWF, appears euvolemic at present. Renal team is following,
   appreciate assistance. Will transfuse one unit of PRBCs as discussed
   above. Given evidence of hypervolemia on CXR and hyperkalemia, will
   need dialysis tomorrow.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 y/o M with DMI, ESRD who presents with bleeding
   during bronch done for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse
   ground glass infiltrates.
   Transient Massive Hemoptysis During Bronch: likely source of bleeding
   was identified during flex bronch, IP thinks it may be a dulefoys
   ulcer, although these are usually seen in GI tract.   Of note patient
   had DES 5 months prior and is on ASa/Plavix. etiologies of the bleed
   include AVM, clot from previous bronch in setting of anticoagulation
   although doesnt appear same lobe, vasculitis, CA (although not
   visualized on CT) possibly carcinoid, HTN also likely contributed. Also
   considering trauma and infection.
   - Keep patient sedated overnight with propfol
   - cough suppressants following to prevent clot from dislodging
   - should patient rebleed, push ET tube into right bronchus and turn
   patient left side down.
   - DDAVP given on ASA/plavix
   - CXR now, and daily
   - keep plavix for now, discontinue ASA
   - IP to rebronch today, will f/u results
   - Will call IR to make aware he may need embolization if he bleeds
   Ground Glass Opacities: these have worsened since previous CT in
   [**Month (only) **]. Differential  inculdes vasculitis, possibly goodpastures or
   wegeners given concurrent kidney disease. Also possible infectious, may
   be PCP (although no risk factors), viral possible, atypical, fungal.
   Also may be beginning of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis. Considering drug toxicity, but no known exposures to drugs
   known to cause pulm issues. Most likely in this patient given
   hemosiderin laiden macrophages and high wedges and hypertension is
   heart failure related interstitial process.
   - For vasculitic processes: f/u anti GBP, ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **].
   - RF , CRP, ESR: all elevated
   - f/u BAL for infectious etiology
   - treat htn and recheck CT scan after hemodynamically controlled for
   several weeks.
   - check ttg for [**Male First Name (un) 1295**]-[**Location (un) 1296**] Syndrome
    Respiratory: on AC, last gas from OR alkalemic: patient alkalemic, but
   with normal PCO2 and bicarb.
   - will keep on AC, decrease RR 14
 10, as likely usually hypercarbic
   - recheck gas, adjust as necessary
    HTN: running high on floor as well, will try to keep goal BP 150 for
   now.
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 284**], Metoprolol, nifedipine, lisinopril, isorbide
   mononitrate-- switched to short acting, because long acting is not
   crushable.
   - PRN hydral as needed overnight has HTN will exacerbate bleed
    CAD: recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**].
   - continue Atorvastatin 80mg, Zetia, Losartan, Metoprolol, nifedipine,
   isosorbide monitrate and lisinoprol.
   - hold ASA and continue plavix.
   DMI: continue home doses, half standing while NPO
   ESRD: MWF, appears euvolemic at present.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of depression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and recent myocardial infarction (MI). He presents with persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates on chest CT. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, during which he experienced a massive hemoptysis. The likely source of bleeding was identified as a duodenal ulcer. Other potential etiologies of the bleed include arteriovenous malformation (AVM), clot from previous bronchoscopies in the setting of anticoagulation, vasculitis, cancer (possibly carcinoid), hypertension, trauma, or infection. The patient's ground glass opacities have worsened since the previous CT scan and could be due to various causes such as vasculitis, infection, or heart failure-related interstitial process. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient had a massive hemoptysis during bronchoscopy, and there is a risk of re-bleeding if the source of bleeding is not adequately managed.
2. Infection: The worsening ground glass infiltrates could be indicative of an infection, such as pneumonia or pulmonary tuberculosis. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever and increased white blood cell count, is important.
3. Heart failure: The patient's hypertension and worsening ground glass infiltrates could be related to heart failure. Monitoring for symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 48 year old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus, ESRD on
   dialysiswho presents with bleeding during bronch done for persistent
   hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates.
   Transient Massive Hemoptysis During Bronch: likely source of bleeding
   was identified during flex bronch, IP thinks it may be a dulefoys
   ulcer, although these are usually seen in GI tract.   Of note patient
   had DES 5 months prior and is on ASa/Plavix. etiologies of the bleed
   include AVM, clot from previous bronch in setting of anticoagulation
   although doesnt appear same lobe, vasculitis, CA (although not
   visualized on CT) possibly carcinoid, HTN also likely contributed. Also
   considering trauma and infection.
   - Keep patient sedated overnight with propfol
   - cough suppressants following to prevent clot from dislodging
   - should patient rebleed, push ET tube into right bronchus and turn
   patient left side down.
   - DDAVP given on ASA/plavix
   - CXR now, and daily
   - keep plavix for now, discontinue ASA
   - IP to rebronch today, will f/u results
   - Will call IR to make aware he may need embolization if he bleeds
   Ground Glass Opacities: these have worsened since previous CT in
   [**Month (only) **]. Differential  inculdes vasculitis, possibly goodpastures or
   wegeners given concurrent kidney disease. Also possible infectious, may
   be PCP (although no risk factors), viral possible, atypical, fungal.
   Also may be beginning of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis. Considering drug toxicity, but no known exposures to drugs
   known to cause pulm issues. Most likely in this patient given
   hemosiderin laiden macrophages and high wedges and hypertension is
   heart failure related interstitial process.
   - For vasculitic processes: f/u anti GBP, ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **].
   - RF , CRP, ESR: all elevated
   - f/u BAL for infectious etiology
   - treat htn and recheck CT scan after hemodynamically controlled for
   several weeks.
    Respiratory: on AC - resp alkalosis - drop back up rate
   - recheck gas, adjust as necessary
    HTN: running high on floor as well, will try to keep goal BP 150 for
   now.
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 284**], Metoprolol, nifedipine, lisinopril, isorbide
   mononitrate-- switched to short acting, because long acting is not
   crushable.
   - PRN hydral as needed overnight has HTN will exacerbate bleed
    CAD: recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**].
   - continue Atorvastatin 80mg, Zetia, Losartan, Metoprolol, nifedipine,
   isosorbide monitrate and lisinoprol.
   - hold ASA and continue plavix.
   DMI: continue home doses, half standing while NPO
   ESRD: MWF, appears euvolemic at present.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. He presents with bleeding during a bronchoscopic procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates. The patient had a recent drug-eluting stent (DES) placement in the right coronary artery (RCA) five months prior and is on aspirin (ASA) and Plavix. 

The assessment and plan include keeping the patient sedated overnight with propofol, using cough suppressants to prevent clot dislodgment, and pushing the endotracheal tube into the right bronchus and turning the patient left side down if there is another bleed. DDAVP was given due to ASA/Plavix usage. A chest X-ray (CXR) was ordered, and daily CXRs are to be followed. Plavix will be continued for now, while ASA is to be discontinued. The interventional radiology (IR) team should be informed about the possibility of embolization if the patient bleeds again. 

Ground glass opacities have worsened since the previous CT scan. The differential diagnosis includes vasculitis, possibly Goodpasture's or Wegener's syndrome given the concurrent kidney disease. Other possibilities include infectious causes such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), viral, atypical, or fungal infections. Drug toxicity is also"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 48 year old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus, ESRD on
   dialysiswho presents with bleeding during bronch done for persistent
   hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates.
   Hemoptysis: Dulefoys lesion: White out of left lung on AM chest xray,
   IP bronched, saw oozing blood at source. Will rigid tomorrow in OR.  As
   noted previously, likely source of bleeding was identified during flex
   bronch, IP team feels it may be a dulefoys ulcer, although these are
   usually seen in GI tract
   - Given oozing, will keep intubated, plan for OR for rigid bronch in
   am.
   - PS in AM, plan to extubated after rigid.
   - Should patient re-bleed, plan is to push ET tube into right bronchus
   and turn patient left side down, call IP and IR urgently.
   - Per Cardiology ok to discontinue plavix and continue ASA only.
   - CXR daily.
   - standing cough suppression.
   - Per renal team, may benefit from a bleeding perspective with blood
   transfusion, so giving one unit of PRBCs.
   - IR and CT surgery aware of patient should IP team not be able to
   control bleeding.
   Ground Glass Opacities: These have worsened since previous CT in
   [**Month (only) 270**]. Differential  inculdes vasculitis, possibly goodpastures or
   wegeners given concurrent kidney disease. Also possible infectious, may
   be PCP (although no risk factors), viral possible, atypical, fungal.
   Also may be beginning of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis. Considering drug toxicity, but no known exposures to drugs
   known to cause pulm issues. Most likely in this patient given
   hemosiderin laiden macrophages and high wedges and hypertension is
   heart failure related interstitial process.
   - For vasculitic processes: ANCA negative, Anti-GBM pending, ACA
   pending, TTG pending.
   - RF , CRP, ESR: all elevated
   - No growth of culture data from BAL.
   - Will continue to treat hypertension and re-check CT scan after
   hemodynamically controlled for several weeks.
   - TTG pending for [**Male First Name (un) 1367**]-[**Location (un) 1296**] Syndrome
   Respiratory: Patient remains on AC, last gas demonstrates alkalosis,
   suspect patient is usually hypercarbic given obesity (and likely
   hypoventilation) and OSA, but with normal PCO2 and bicarb.
   - Keep intubated for  now, will try pressure support this PM for plan
   to extubated after rigid bronch tomorrow.
   - Recheck gas, adjust as necessary
   HTN: Overall improved control, but systolic to 180 this morning prior
   to medications. Goal SBP <150 for now.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 284**], Metoprolol, lisinopril, isorbide mononitrate-- switched
   to short acting, because long acting is not crushable. Nifedipine on
   hold as no appropriate short-acting (crushable) alternative is
   available.
   - PRN hydral as needed overnight has HTN will exacerbate bleed
   CAD: recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**].
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg, Zetia, Losartan, Metoprolol, nifedipine,
   isosorbide monitrate and lisinoprol.
   - Appreciate cardiology assistance: Stopping plavix in light of
   significant bleeding, continuing ASA 325 mg.
   DMI: Patient was persistently hypoglycemic yesterday in setting of
   receiving full dose of NPH, renal failure, and NPO status. Monitoring
   frequent finger sticks (1-2 hours), and will initiate insulin drip once
   FSBG above 120-140.
   ESRD: MWF, appears euvolemic at present. Renal team is following,
   appreciate assistance. Will transfuse one unit of PRBCs as discussed
   above. Given evidence of hypervolemia on CXR and hyperkalemia, will
   need dialysis tomorrow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. He presents with bleeding during a bronchoscopic procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates on chest x-ray. 

The patient has several medical complications that need attention. Firstly, the bleeding during the bronchoscopic procedure indicates a potential source of internal bleeding. The plan is to keep the patient intubated and perform a rigid bronchoscopy in the operating room (OR) to identify and control the bleeding. If the patient re-bleeds, the plan is to push the endotracheal tube (ETT) into the right bronchus and turn the patient left side down, calling for interventional radiology (IR) and critical care assistance urgently.

Secondly, the patient's ground glass opacities have worsened since the previous CT scan. This could be due to various causes such as vasculitis (e.g., Goodpasture's or Wegener's), infection (e.g., Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), viral, atypical, or fungal infection, or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Given the patient's history of kidney disease, heart failure-related interstitial lung disease is also a possibility. Further tests are being done to rule out these possibilities, including ANCA, Anti-GBM, ACA, TTG, RF,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 48 year old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus, ESRD on
   dialysiswho presents with bleeding during bronch done for persistent
   hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates.
   Transient Massive Hemoptysis During Bronch:
   Overnight, one episode of coughing with bright red blood, dried clot
   noted in ETT. As noted previously, likely source of bleeding was
   identified during flex bronch, IP team feels it may be a dulefoys
   ulcer, although these are usually seen in GI tract.  Of note patient
   had DES 5 months prior and is on ASA/Plavix. Other etiologies of the
   bleed include AVM, clot from previous bronch in setting of
   anticoagulation although doesnt appear same lobe, vasculitis, CA
   (although not visualized on CT) possibly carcinoid, HTN also likely
   contributed. Also considering trauma and infection.
   - Given episode of hemoptysis overnight with single episode of
   coughing, will hold off on extubation for one additional day and
   continue sedation and cough suppression. Per IP team, airways appeared
   overall clean yesterday.
   - Should patient re-bleed, plan is to push ET tube into right bronchus
   and turn patient left side down, call IP and IR urgently.
   - Per Cardiology ok to discontinue plavix and continue ASA only.
   - CXR daily.
   - Per renal team, may benefit from a bleeding perspective with blood
   transfusion, so giving one unit of PRBCs.
   - IR and CT surgery aware of patient should IP team not be able to
   control bleeding.
   Ground Glass Opacities: These have worsened since previous CT in
   [**Month (only) 270**]. Differential  inculdes vasculitis, possibly goodpastures or
   wegeners given concurrent kidney disease. Also possible infectious, may
   be PCP (although no risk factors), viral possible, atypical, fungal.
   Also may be beginning of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis. Considering drug toxicity, but no known exposures to drugs
   known to cause pulm issues. Most likely in this patient given
   hemosiderin laiden macrophages and high wedges and hypertension is
   heart failure related interstitial process.
   - For vasculitic processes: ANCA negative, Anti-GBM pending, ACA
   pending, TTG pending.
   - RF , CRP, ESR: all elevated
   - No growth of culture data from BAL.
   - Will continue to treat hypertension and re-check CT scan after
   hemodynamically controlled for several weeks.
   - TTG pending for [**Male First Name (un) 1367**]-[**Location (un) 1296**] Syndrome
   Respiratory: Patient remains on AC, last gas demonstrates alkalosis,
   suspect patient is usually hypercarbic given obesity (and likely
   hypoventilation) and OSA, but with normal PCO2 and bicarb.
   - Rate decreased to 10 this AM, will re-check.
   - Recheck gas, adjust as necessary
   HTN: Overall improved control, but systolic to 180 this morning prior
   to medications. Goal SBP <150 for now.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 284**], Metoprolol, lisinopril, isorbide mononitrate-- switched
   to short acting, because long acting is not crushable. Nifedipine on
   hold as no appropriate short-acting (crushable) alternative is
   available.
   - PRN hydral as needed overnight has HTN will exacerbate bleed
   CAD: recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**].
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg, Zetia, Losartan, Metoprolol, nifedipine,
   isosorbide monitrate and lisinoprol.
   - Appreciate cardiology assistance: Stopping plavix in light of
   significant bleeding, continuing ASA 325 mg.
   DMI: Patient was persistently hypoglycemic yesterday in setting of
   receiving full dose of NPH, renal failure, and NPO status. Monitoring
   frequent finger sticks (1-2 hours), and will initiate insulin drip once
   FSBG above 120-140.
   ESRD: MWF, appears euvolemic at present. Renal team is following,
   appreciate assistance. Will transfuse one unit of PRBCs as discussed
   above. Given evidence of hypervolemia on CXR and hyperkalemia, will
   need dialysis tomorrow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. He presents with bleeding during a bronchoscopic procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates on chest CT. The patient has a history of dual antiplatelet therapy (ASA/Plavix) after a recent drug-eluting stent placement for coronary artery disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient experienced an episode of massive hemoptysis overnight, which is concerning for potential re-bleeding. The source of bleeding may be due to a duodenal ulcer, anticoagulation therapy, vasculitis, cancer, hypertension, trauma, or infection. Measures such as pushing the ET tube into the right bronchus and turning the patient left side down will be implemented if there is another episode of hemoptysis. The plan is to urgently call the interventional radiology (IR) team if the IP team cannot control the bleeding.
2. Ground Glass Opacities: The patient's ground glass opacities have worsened since the previous CT scan. Differential diagnoses include vasculitis (such as Goodpasture syndrome or Wegener's granulomatosis), infection (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), viral, atypical, or fungal infections, interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or drug toxicity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on dialysis. He presents with bleeding during a bronchoscopic procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates on chest X-ray. The bleeding is likely due to several factors including anticoagulation, hypertension, trauma, infection, or a vascular abnormality. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and recent drug-eluting stent placement. He is currently sedated and will undergo a rigid bronchoscopy in the operating room tomorrow. The ground glass opacities on his chest X-ray could be caused by various conditions such as vasculitis, infection, or heart failure-related interstitial lung disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Massive Hemoptysis: The patient's recent episode of massive hemoptysis suggests a potential complication related to bleeding. This could be due to the underlying causes mentioned earlier, including AVM, clot from previous bronchoscopic procedure, vasculitis, cancer, or hypertension.
2. Infection: The patient's worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates raise the possibility of an infectious process, such as pneumonia caused by pathogens like Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP), viral, atypical, or fungal infections. This can lead to severe respiratory distress and sepsis.
3. Vasculitis: Given the patient's concurrent kidney disease, there is a possibility of vasculitis, specifically Good"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 48 year old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus, ESRD on
   dialysiswho presents with bleeding during bronch done for persistent
   hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates.
   Hemoptysis: Dulefoys lesion: White out of left lung on AM chest xray
   yesterday, IP bronched, saw oozing blood at source. Will rigid today in
   OR.  As noted previously, likely source of bleeding was identified
   during flex bronch, IP team feels it may be a dulefoys ulcer, although
   these are usually seen in GI tract
   - Given oozing, will keep intubated, plan for OR for rigid bronch
   today.
   - PS in AM, plan to extubated after rigid.
   - Should patient re-bleed, plan is to push ET tube into right bronchus
   and turn patient left side down, call IP and IR urgently.
   - Per Cardiology ok to discontinue plavix and continue ASA only.
   - CXR daily.
   - standing cough suppression.
   - IR and CT surgery aware of patient should IP team not be able to
   control bleeding.
   Ground Glass Opacities: These have worsened since previous CT in
   [**Month (only) 270**]. Differential  inculdes vasculitis, possibly goodpastures or
   wegeners given concurrent kidney disease. Also possible infectious, may
   be PCP (although no risk factors), viral possible, atypical, fungal.
   Also may be beginning of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis. Considering drug toxicity, but no known exposures to drugs
   known to cause pulm issues. Most likely in this patient given
   hemosiderin laiden macrophages and high wedges and hypertension is
   heart failure related interstitial process.
   - For vasculitic processes: ANCA negative, Anti-GBM pending, ACA
   pending, TTG pending.
   - RF , CRP, ESR: all elevated
   - No growth of culture data from BAL.
   - Will continue to treat hypertension and re-check CT scan after
   hemodynamically controlled for several weeks.
   - TTG pending for [**Male First Name (un) 1367**]-[**Location (un) 1296**] Syndrome
   Respiratory: Patient remains on AC, last gas demonstrates alkalosis,
   suspect patient is usually hypercarbic given obesity (and likely
   hypoventilation) and OSA, but with normal PCO2 and bicarb.
   - Keep intubated for now, will try pressure support this PM for plan to
   extubate after rigid bronch today.
   - Recheck gas, adjust as necessary
   HTN: Overall improved control.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 284**], Metoprolol, lisinopril, isorbide mononitrate-- switched
   to short acting, because long acting is not crushable. Nifedipine on
   hold as no appropriate short-acting (crushable) alternative is
   available.
   - PRN hydral as needed overnight has HTN will exacerbate bleed
   CAD: recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**].
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg, Zetia, Losartan, Metoprolol, nifedipine,
   isosorbide monitrate and lisinoprol.
   - Appreciate cardiology assistance: Stopping plavix in light of
   significant bleeding, continuing ASA 325 mg.
   DMI: Patient was recently hypoglycemic in setting of receiving full
   dose of NPH, renal failure, and NPO status. Interestingly, he
s a type
   1 diabetic and has been off Insulin for several days, but has not
   developed DKA and fingersticks remain low. TSH normal on recent check.
   No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Will start D5 and Insulin as needed
   - Advance diet once extubated and tolerating PO
   ESRD: MWF, appears euvolemic at present. Renal team is following,
   appreciate assistance. Will transfuse one unit of PRBCs as discussed
   above. Given evidence of hypervolemia on CXR and hyperkalemia, will
   need dialysis tomorrow.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. He presents with bleeding during a bronchoscopic procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. A rigid bronchoscopy is planned for today in the operating room. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), recent dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for a stent in the right coronary artery (RCA), and hypertension (HTN) that is currently well-controlled. The patient also has a history of depression and anxiety. 

The patient's respiratory status has been improving, with stable oxygen saturation and decreasing ventilator requirements. However, he continues to have persistent ground glass opacities on chest X-ray, which may be due to an interstitial lung disease process or a vasculitic process such as Goodpasture's syndrome or Wegener's granulomatosis. 

The patient's renal function is compromised, and he requires dialysis three times a week. He is also hypoglycemic and requires insulin coverage. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient experienced significant bleeding during the bronchoscopic procedure, and there is a risk of further bleeding, especially if the patient is extubated. The plan is to keep the patient intub"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. He presented with bleeding during a bronchoscopic procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates. The likely source of bleeding was identified as a possible du Fey's ulcer, although these are usually seen in the gastrointestinal tract. The patient will undergo a rigid bronchoscopy in the operating room today. He will remain intubated due to ongoing oozing of blood, and plans for extubation after the procedure will be made based on the patient's condition. In case of re-bleeding, the plan is to push the endotracheal tube into the right bronchus and turn the patient left side down, and call for interventional radiology (IR) and critical care urgent consultation.

Assessment:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient has persistent hemoptysis, and bleeding has been confirmed during bronchoscopy.
2. Ground Glass Opacities: The patient's ground glass opacities have worsened since the previous CT scan. Differential diagnosis includes vasculitis (such as Goodpasture's or Wegener's syndrome), infectious causes (such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), viral, atypical, or fungal infections. Other possibilities include interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or drug toxicity. Given the presence of hemosiderin-laden"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-inch tall male who was admitted to the ICU due to severe respiratory distress. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, where a significant amount of secretions were removed and some oozing was still noted. The patient tolerated pressure support at 40% throughout the day and propofol was increased to 50.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 63-71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/54-189/186 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,412 mL of total fluids and an output of 4,500 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,088 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube on CPAP/PSV mode with set tidal volume of 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are not provided.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 25.9%, platelet (Plt) count of 245 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 6.1 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 32 mmHg, and blood glucose level of 97 mg/dL. Other lab results are also provided.

The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examinations were not assessed. The patient's arterial line was placed on October 7th and replaced on October 11th.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and use of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of mechanical ventilation can lead to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. Fluid overload: The negative fluid balance suggests that the patient may be at risk of fluid overload due to excessive fluid administration.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine level indicates potential renal dysfunction, which may be due to various factors such as hypoperfusion or nephrotoxic drugs.
6. Septic shock: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and elevated lactate level may indicate an ongoing infection and systemic inflammatory response.

   hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates.
   Hemoptysis: Dulefoys lesion:
   - s/p rigid bronch without e/o rebleeding
   - cont to trend HCT
   - Should patient re-bleed turn patient left side down, call IP and IR
   urgently
   - Extubate this morning
   - Per Cardiology ok to discontinue plavix and continue ASA only.  IP
   noted to restart in 72h after rigid bronch
   - CXR daily.
   - standing cough suppression.
   - IR and CT surgery aware of patient should IP team not be able to
   control bleeding.
   Ground Glass Opacities:
   Unclear causes but unlikely to be vasculitis given neg rheum w/u and
   neg anti-gbm though CRP and ESR were elevated. No known drug exposures.
   Considering [**Male First Name (un) **]-[**Location (un) **]  syndrome as TTG returned positive.  Heart
   failure is also a possibility.
   - Will continue to treat hypertension and re-check CT scan after
   hemodynamically controlled for several weeks.
   Respiratory: Extubated; monitor today
   HTN: Overall improved control.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 284**], Metoprolol, lisinopril, isorbide mononitrate-- switched
   to short acting, because long acting is not crushable. Nifedipine on
   hold as no appropriate short-acting (crushable) alternative is
   available.
   - PRN hydral as needed overnight has HTN will exacerbate bleed
   CAD: recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**].
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg, Zetia, Losartan, Metoprolol, nifedipine,
   isosorbide monitrate and lisinoprol.
   - Appreciate cardiology assistance: Stopping plavix in light of
   significant bleeding, continuing ASA 325 mg.
 restart plavix as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on dialysis. He presented with bleeding during a bronchoscopic procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates. The patient has been intubated and received a rigid bronchoscopy without significant findings. He has been consistently hypoglycemic or normoglycemic and has not developed diabetic ketoacidosis despite being off insulin for several days. The patient's bleeding has been controlled, and he has been extubated. His current conditions include hemoptysis, ground glass opacities, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and end-stage renal disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient initially presented with bleeding during bronchoscopy, indicating a potential risk of rebleeding. If the patient were to rebleed, turning him to the left side down and calling the interventional pulmonology (IP) and interventional radiology (IR) teams urgently would be necessary.
2. Ground Glass Opacities: The patient's diffuse ground glass infiltrates could indicate various underlying conditions such as vasculitis, heart failure, or [**Male First Name (un) **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome. Further evaluation and monitoring are needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension has improved, but close monitoring and continued treatment with ant"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with a weight of unknown pounds. The patient is a type I diabetic and has been consistently hypoglycemic/normoglycemic. They underwent a rigid bronchoscopy yesterday with APC and had interval inc left upper lobe (LUL) atelectasis, which was rebronched without significant findings. The patient remained intubated overnight and had an NG tube inserted last night for medication administration as the original nasogastric tube was removed in the IP suite.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/56 mmHg to 199/149 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 10 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 43.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 48 year old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus, ESRD on
   dialysiswho presents with bleeding during bronch done for persistent
   hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates.
   Hemoptysis: Dulefoys lesion:
   - s/p rigid bronch without e/o rebleeding
   - cont to trend HCT
   - Should patient re-bleed turn patient left side down, call IP and IR
   urgently
   - Extubate this morning
   - Per Cardiology ok to discontinue plavix and continue ASA only.  IP
   noted to restart in 72h after rigid bronch
   - CXR daily.
   - standing cough suppression.
   - IR and CT surgery aware of patient should IP team not be able to
   control bleeding.
   Ground Glass Opacities: These have worsened since previous CT in
   [**Month (only) 270**]. Differential  inculdes vasculitis, possibly goodpastures or
   wegeners given concurrent kidney disease. Also possible infectious, may
   be PCP (although no risk factors), viral possible, atypical, fungal.
   Also may be beginning of interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity
   pneumonitis. Considering drug toxicity, but no known exposures to drugs
   known to cause pulm issues. Most likely in this patient given
   hemosiderin laiden macrophages and high wedges and hypertension is
   heart failure related interstitial process.
   - For vasculitic processes: ANCA negative, Anti-GBM negative, TTG
   POSITIVE.
   - RF , CRP, ESR: all elevated
   - No growth of culture data from BAL.
   - Will continue to treat hypertension and re-check CT scan after
   hemodynamically controlled for several weeks.
   - TTG pending for [**Male First Name (un) 1367**]-[**Location (un) 1296**] Syndrome
   Respiratory: Patient remains on PS, last gas demonstrates alkalosis,
   suspect patient is usually hypercarbic given obesity (and likely
   hypoventilation) and OSA, but with normal PCO2 and bicarb.
   - Keep intubated for now, will try pressure support this PM for plan to
   extubate after rigid bronch today.
   - Recheck gas, adjust as necessary
   HTN: Overall improved control.
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 284**], Metoprolol, lisinopril, isorbide mononitrate-- switched
   to short acting, because long acting is not crushable. Nifedipine on
   hold as no appropriate short-acting (crushable) alternative is
   available.
   - PRN hydral as needed overnight has HTN will exacerbate bleed
   CAD: recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**].
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg, Zetia, Losartan, Metoprolol, nifedipine,
   isosorbide monitrate and lisinoprol.
   - Appreciate cardiology assistance: Stopping plavix in light of
   significant bleeding, continuing ASA 325 mg.
   DMI: Patient was recently hypoglycemic in setting of receiving full
   dose of NPH, renal failure, and NPO status. Interestingly, he
s a type
   1 diabetic and has been off Insulin for several days, but has not
   developed DKA and fingersticks remain low. TSH normal on recent check.
   No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.
   - Will start D5 and Insulin as needed
   - Advance diet once extubated and tolerating PO
   ESRD: MWF, appears euvolemic at present. Renal team is following,
   appreciate assistance. Will transfuse one unit of PRBCs as discussed
   above. Given evidence of hypervolemia on CXR and hyperkalemia, will
   need dialysis tomorrow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on dialysis. He presents with bleeding during a bronch procedure for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates. The patient has undergone various interventions, including rigid bronchoscopy without evidence of rebleeding, extubation, and initiation of Plavix. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient had bleeding during the bronch procedure but was successfully managed with rigid bronchoscopy. The source of bleeding was controlled, and the patient is stable with no signs of rebleeding. Plavix therapy will be started tomorrow, and the patient will be monitored closely.
2. Ground Glass Opacities: The cause of the ground glass opacities is unclear. It is unlikely to be vasculitis given the negative rheumatology workup and negative anti-GBM antibodies. Elevated CRP and ESR levels suggest an inflammatory process. Considering the positive TTG (tissue transglutaminase) result, celiac disease should be considered. Heart failure is also a possibility. Treatment will focus on controlling hypertension and rechecking the CT scan after hemodynamic stabilization for several weeks.
3. Respiratory: The patient has been extubated and will be monitored closely.
4. HTN: Overall improved control. Medications will continue to be administered as before, including [**Last Name (un) 284"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with hemoptysis. He underwent a rigid bronchoscopy and was found to have a Duveley's lesion. The patient is currently stable and can now undergo daily hemocult checks. If there is any re-bleeding, the patient should be turned to the left side down and urgent consultation of interventional pulmonology (IP) and interventional radiology (IR) should be called. The patient is to continue taking aspirin and Plavix 72 hours after the bronchoscopic procedure. A chest X-ray will be done tomorrow due to concerns of left-sided subcutaneous air, although no evidence was found on examination. The patient's ground glass opacities will require a repeat CT scan in several weeks as there have been negative results so far, raising concerns about possible celiac disease. The patient's respiratory status is stable on minimal oxygen support and will continue to be weaned. He has hypertension, which will continue with home medications, and once he can eat, his oral doses will be increased and nifedipine will be added back. PRN hydralazine IV will be administered while the patient is NPO. The patient has a history of recent dual antiplatelet therapy (D"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient experienced several events including stopping codeine for cough, receiving hemodialysis (HD), and having a consultation with the physician. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 3,043 mL, indicating potential fluid loss or excessive fluid removal through diuresis or other means. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate ranging from 74-90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/31-145/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.23. The physical examination reveals clear lungs, normal heart sounds, and no peripheral pulses assessed. Neurologic examination is not assessed. The patient's general appearance is alert and awake. The rest of the examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine (Cr) levels, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count (Plt), elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient has been on various treatments including insulin, invasive ventilation, arterial line, and other medications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ON events. Codeine for cough was stopped, and the patient received hemodialysis (HD). The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 3,043 mL since 12 AM. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 145/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results show normal values. Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration: The patient may be at risk for aspiration due to concerns raised by the nursing staff. This can lead to respiratory infections such as pneumonia.
2. Fluid Imbalance: The negative fluid balance of 3,043 mL suggests significant fluid loss, which may indicate dehydration or ongoing fluid losses through other means.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 7.1 mEq/L, indicating hyperkalemia. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have been fluctuating, with values ranging from 6.0 mg/dL to 9.0 mg/dL. AKI"

   CXR: Yesterday:
   Left lower lobe has re-expanded following bronchoscopy.
   Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed. Linear
   lucency overlies the lower left neck and proximal left clavicle, and
   may reflect
   subcutaneous emphysema, but small amount of pneumomediastinum is not
   excluded.
   Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and pulmonary vascularity is
   engorged,
   but there is no overt pulmonary edema.
   Microbiology: No new changes
   Assessment and Plan
   48 M with T1DM, ESRD on HD who p/w hemoptysis, now s/p recent rigid
   bronch for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass
   infiltrates.
   Hemoptysis: Dulefoys lesion
   -          s/p rigid bronch without e/o rebleeding
   -          can now do daily HCT, has been stable
   -          if re-bleed, turn pt left side down and call IP and IR
   urgently
   -          Plan to restart clopidogrel today, continue aspirin.
   -          Awaiting repeat CXR for today for ? subcut air
   Ground glass opacities:
   -          will need repeat CT in several weeks, w/u thus far has been
   negative, concern for possible celiac disease
   Respiratory:
   Oxygen stable on minimal amount of nasal cannula support, continue to
   wean
   HTN
   Continue home meds, once he can eat can increase PO doses and add back
   nifedipine
   PRN hydralazine IV while NPO
   CAD recent DES to RCA in [**5-5**]
   -          continue home meds, re-start Plavix today
   T1DM
   Has been hypoglycemia, has not needed insulin, will monitor for now, no
   acute indication for insulin gtt at this time, continue Q2H
   fingersticks, watch gap for evidence of DKA. Lab shows trace acetone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis who presented with hemoptysis. He underwent a rigid bronchoscopy for persistent hemoptysis and worsening diffuse ground glass infiltrates. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is oxygenating well on minimal amounts of nasal cannula support. However, there are some potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient had a history of hemoptysis and underwent a rigid bronchoscopy. There is a possibility of re-bleeding, which may require immediate attention by calling the interventional pulmonology (IP) and interventional radiology (IR) teams. The patient should be turned to the left side down and receive IV hydralazine as per the plan.
2. Pneumomediastinum: The chest X-ray shows linear lucency overlying the lower left neck and proximal left clavicle, which may reflect subcutaneous emphysema. This raises the possibility of pneumomediastinum, although it is not excluded. Monitoring for any signs or symptoms of pneumomediastinum is essential.
3. Ground glass opacities: The patient has ground glass opacities on imaging. If these opacities persist or worsen, further evaluation, such as a repeat CT scan"
