","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), abdominal pain, common bile duct (CBD) dilatation, cholelithiasis/choledocholithiasis, liver enzyme abnormalities, chronic renal failure, hypertension, hypothyroidism, depression, and breast cancer in remission. 

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and sphincterotomy with stent placement due to CBD dilatation and suspected choledocholithiasis. The liver enzyme abnormalities are consistent with ductal obstruction. The patient's cardiac enzymes are being closely monitored, and there are non-diagnostic ST changes seen on the EKG, which may be associated with demand and underlying disease.

The patient also has an elevated systolic pressure and high pulse pressure, indicating possible hypertension. There are no physical exam findings clearly associated with aortic regurgitation, and no known history of valvular disease.

The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, but the baseline creatinine level is not clear. Her renal function will be followed by a nephrologist.

The patient has several other medical conditions, including hypothyroidism, depression, and breast cancer in remission. She is currently on levoxyl for hypothyroidism and will restart zoloft for depression when the appropriate dose is established.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of CABG, abdominal pain, and CBD dilatation. She has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and treatment. Her medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, depression, breast cancer, and possible chronic renal failure. She underwent ERCP and sphincterotomy with stent placement. She is currently on IV medications including heparin sodium, metoprolol, and hydralazine. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 151/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation and her ABG results are within normal limits. Her laboratory values show elevated liver enzymes and abnormal bilirubin levels, consistent with cholelithiasis/choledocholithiasis. She also has non-diagnostic ST changes on EKG, which may be associated with demand and underlying disease. The patient's renal function is impaired, but it is unclear if this is a new development or a chronic issue. She has a history of depression, for which she is currently not receiving treatment, and breast cancer, but no evidence of recurrence or metastasis was found on the recent CT scan. She is receiving prophylactic treatment for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."
