   65 yo M with PMH of HIV on HAART, DM2, hepatitis C, ESRD on HD who
   presents with abdominal pain for several days.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Continuing and cause continues to be unclear.
   Unlikely to be due to CT finding of abnormality at head of the
   pancreas.  Per radiology, likely not a mass as it would cause
   obstruction.  Given history of severe gastritis, this is also a
   possibility.  Needs access for CT scan of pancreas to further assess.
   -Appreciate GI following
   -Will attempt to place PIV today, may need to have IR place mid-line.
   - GI will do EGD when stable to assess for gastritis or PUD; however
   needs access prior to this.
   -monitor serial abdominal exams
   -will need colonoscopy at some point as well given history of 1cm polyp
   in [**2119**].
   -PPI [**Hospital1 **] per GI recs
   -bowel regimen
   .
   # tachycardia: currently in sinus tach with rates in the 120s.  It
   appears that for his last hospitalization, he came in on lopressor but
   was not discharged on it. This could also be contributing to his
   tachycardia at this time.  Most likely secondary to pain.   TSH
   normal.  ECGs show sinus tachycardia.
   -check ECHO for cardiomyopathy (HTN related vs HIV related)
   -monitor HR
   .
   # DM2: not on medications for this. Will use fingersticks and insulin
   prn
   .
   # chronic systolic and diastolic CHF: currently euvolemic.
   -continue HD for fluid removal
   -fluid restriction to 1.2L per day
   -not on ACEI perhaps given renal failure and not on BB for unclear
   reasons
   .
   # ESRD on HD: had dialysis yesterday. Due on Tues, Thurs, Sat schedule.
   -let renal/dialysis team know he is in house
   -renally dose medications
   -continue sevelamer
   .
   # HIV/AIDs: on HAART. [**6-16**] CD4 was 392 with undetectable viral load
   -continue medications
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 266**] aware.
   .
   # Hepatitis C:
   -continue meds
   .
   # access: history of clots in most veins. OMR notes that femoral line
   with HD cath is last possible site for dialysis catheter. Last
   infection was treated through without removal as it has been noted that
   if he loses this access, he will not be able to have dialysis anymore.
   No PIV is able to be obtained and given clots in neck and chest veins,
   no central access possible either. Patient is aware of situation and
   this was reviewed with him again.
   - will attempt PIV today for CT contrast

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of HIV, diabetes mellitus type 2, hepatitis C, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presents with abdominal pain for several days, which continues and remains unclear in terms of cause. The patient has undergone various tests and examinations.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain has been ongoing for several days, and the cause is unclear. It is unlikely to be due to an abnormality at the head of the pancreas, but further assessment is needed through a CT scan of the pancreas. Gastritis is also a possibility, and monitoring serial abdominal exams is recommended.

2. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing sinus tachycardia, which could be secondary to pain or a result of being off Lopressor. It is important to monitor the heart rate and consider an echocardiogram to assess for cardiomyopathy related to hypertension or HIV.

3. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient is not currently on medication for DM2. Fingersticks and insulin prn should be used for management.

4. Chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient is euvolemic and on hemodialysis. Continuing hemodialysis for fluid removal, restricting fluid intake to 1.2L per day,"

   # Abdominal pain: Unclear cause. Abdomen is soft and non-tender
   currently but reportedly was epigastric prior (he complains of it
   having been all over) and CT abdomen without contrast though, showed no
   obvious reason for abdominal pain in a diffuse pattern. It did suggest
   that there may be a mass on the head of the pancreas. DDX also includes
   PUD, gastritis (in [**2125**] he had severe gastritis on EGD),
   gastroenteritis (no diarrhea or vomiting though or fevers),
   constipation.

   extensive history of clots but no other signs of PE -not hypoxic,
   hypotensive or having chest pain and he is supratherapeutic with his

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo M with PMH of HIV on HAART, DM2, hepatitis C, ESRD on HD who
   presents with abdominal pain for several days.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Continuing and underlying cause remains unclear.
   Abdominal CT unrevealing and does not suggest mass or obstruction in
   the pancrease.  Given history of severe gastritis, this is also a
   possibility.  GI is following and recommends a colonoscopy (hx of polyp
   in [**2119**]), but patient needs better access for sedation and would have
   to reverse INR which carries a risk of clot in HD catheter.  Will need
   to discuss further with nephrology and the patient.
   - Continue IV protonix
   - Appreciate GI following, f/u their recs
   - Attempt midline placement today with assistance from IR.
   - monitor serial abdominal exams
   - bowel regimen
   .
   # tachycardia: currently in sinus tach with rates in the 120s.  It
   appears that for his last hospitalization, he came in on lopressor but
   was not discharged on it. This could also be contributing to his
   tachycardia at this time.  Most likely secondary to pain.   TSH
   normal.  ECGs show sinus tachycardia.
   -check ECHO for cardiomyopathy (HTN related vs HIV related)
   -monitor HR
   .
   # DM2: not on medications for this. Will use fingersticks and insulin
   prn
   .
   # chronic systolic and diastolic CHF: currently euvolemic.
   -continue HD for fluid removal
   -fluid restriction to 1.2L per day
   -not on ACEI perhaps given renal failure and not on BB for unclear
   reasons
   .
   # ESRD on HD: had dialysis yesterday. Due on Tues, Thurs, Sat schedule.
   -let renal/dialysis team know he is in house
   -renally dose medications
   -continue sevelamer
   .
   # HIV/AIDs: on HAART. [**6-16**] CD4 was 392 with undetectable viral load
   -continue medications
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 266**] aware.
   .
   # Hepatitis C:
   -continue meds
   .
   # access: history of clots in most veins. OMR notes that femoral line
   with HD cath is last possible site for dialysis catheter. Last
   infection was treated through without removal as it has been noted that
   if he loses this access, he will not be able to have dialysis anymore.
   No PIV is able to be obtained and given clots in neck and chest veins,
   no central access possible either. Patient is aware of situation and
   this was reviewed with him again.
   - will attempt PIV today for CT contrast

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of HIV on HAART, diabetes mellitus type 2, hepatitis C, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presents with ongoing abdominal pain for several days. The abdominal CT scan did not reveal any masses or obstructions in the pancreas. Given the history of severe gastritis, this is also a possibility. The patient needs better access for sedation and would have to reverse INR, which carries a risk of clot in the HD catheter. It is recommended to discuss further with nephrology and the patient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal pain: The underlying cause of the abdominal pain remains unclear. The abdominal CT scan did not show any masses or obstructions in the pancreas. It is possible that severe gastritis could be a contributing factor. Further evaluation and management by the gastroenterology team is recommended.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, ranging from 120s. This could be due to pain or potential withdrawal from lopressor, which was not discharged previously. Monitoring the heart rate and considering medications to control it, if necessary, is advised.

3. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient is not currently on medications for DM2. Insulin therapy may be required, and fingerstick glucose monitoring should be performed regularly.

4. Chronic systolic and diastolic congestive"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of HIV on HAART, diabetes mellitus type 2, hepatitis C, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presents with abdominal pain for several days. The abdominal CT scan did not reveal any masses or obstructions in the pancreas. The patient has been experiencing fever, lethargy, and disconjugate gaze. He also has a history of severe gastritis and a colonoscopy is recommended but needs better access for sedation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Abdominal pain: Continue IV protonix. Appreciate GI following, f/u their recommendations. Attempt midline placement today with assistance from IR. Monitor serial abdominal exams. Bowel regimen.
2. Anticoagulation: Encourage PO intake. Continue to monitor INR. Consider partial reversal with vitamin K and/or FFP.
3. Tachycardia: Resolved. Continue metoprolol. Start nifedipine. Monitor HR.
4. Hypertension: Goal SBP = 160-180. Use metoprolol and nifedipine for BP control. Consider hydralazine if needed.
5. DM2: Use fingersticks and insulin prn.
6. Chronic systolic and diastolic CHF: Continue HD for fluid removal. Fluid restriction to 1.2L per day. Not on ACEI perhaps given renal failure.
7. ESRD on HD: Had dialysis yesterday. Usually on Tues, Thurs, Sat schedule. Is receiving MWF this week. Renal/dialysis team is following. Renally dose medications. Continue sevelamer.
8. HIV/AIDS: Continue medications. Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 266] aware.
9. Hepatitis C: Continue meds.
10. Access: History of clots in most veins. OMR notes that femoral line with HD cath is last possible site for dialysis catheter. Last infection was treated without removal as it has been noted that if he loses this access, he will not be able to have dialysis anymore. PIV placed yesterday. Place midline today.
11. FEN: Low NA, renal diet.
12. PPX: Holding coumadin due to supratherapeutic INR currently, bowel reg. Wound care consult.
13. Code: Full.
14. ICU Care: Nutrition, glycemic control, lines, dialysis catheter, prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP), comments, code status, disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal pain may progress to peritonitis or bowel ischemia if not properly managed.
2. Anticoagulation therapy carries the risk of bleeding complications if INR is not closely monitored.
3. Tachycardia may worsen if hypertension is not controlled effectively.
4. Hypertension if"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo M with PMH of HIV on HAART, DM2, hepatitis C, ESRD on HD who
   presents with abdominal pain for several days.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Continuing and cause continues to be unclear.
   Unlikely to be due to CT finding of abnormality at head of the
   pancreas.  Per radiology, likely not a mass as it would cause
   obstruction.  Given history of severe gastritis, this is also a
   possibility.  Needs access for CT scan of pancreas to further assess.
   -Appreciate GI following
   -Will attempt to place PIV today, may need to have IR place mid-line.
   - GI will do EGD when stable to assess for gastritis or PUD; however
   needs access prior to this.
   -monitor serial abdominal exams
   -will need colonoscopy at some point as well given history of 1cm polyp
   in [**2119**].
   -PPI [**Hospital1 **] per GI recs
   -bowel regimen
   .
   # tachycardia: currently in sinus tach with rates in the 120s.  It
   appears that for his last hospitalization, he came in on lopressor but
   was not discharged on it. This could also be contributing to his
   tachycardia at this time.  Most likely secondary to pain.   TSH
   normal.  ECGs show sinus tachycardia.
   -check ECHO for cardiomyopathy (HTN related vs HIV related)
   -monitor HR
   .
   # DM2: not on medications for this. Will use fingersticks and insulin
   prn
   .
   # chronic systolic and diastolic CHF: currently euvolemic.
   -continue HD for fluid removal
   -fluid restriction to 1.2L per day
   -not on ACEI perhaps given renal failure and not on BB for unclear
   reasons
   .
   # ESRD on HD: had dialysis yesterday. Due on Tues, Thurs, Sat schedule.
   -let renal/dialysis team know he is in house
   -renally dose medications
   -continue sevelamer
   .
   # HIV/AIDs: on HAART. [**6-16**] CD4 was 392 with undetectable viral load
   -continue medications
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 266**] aware.
   .
   # Hepatitis C:

   infection was treated through without removal as it has been noted that
   if he loses this access, he will not be able to have dialysis anymore.
   No PIV is able to be obtained and given clots in neck and chest veins,
   no central access possible either. Patient is aware of situation and
   this was reviewed with him again.
   - will attempt PIV today for CT contrast

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Abdominal pain: The cause of the abdominal pain is unclear, and further assessment is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could be secondary to pain, severe gastritis, or underlying cardiovascular conditions.
3. Chronic systolic and diastolic CHF: The patient has evidence of cardiomyopathy, but the cause is unclear (HIV-related vs. hypertension-related). Fluid removal through HD and fluid restriction are recommended.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient is on dialysis due to renal failure, and ongoing management of renal function is necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of HIV, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain and high-output nocturnal (HOTN). The patient is still complaining of abdominal pain and is receiving frequent doses of dilaudid for pain control. Notable findings include a decreased global systolic function on echo, heterogeneous head of pancreas on CT abdomen, diminished peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and elevated blood pressure. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 188/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's current condition and history of ESRD put him at risk for further kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and prompt management of any potential precipitating factors are crucial.

2. Hypertensive Emergency/Encephalopathy: The patient's elevated blood pressure may indicate a hypertensive emergency, which can lead to end-organ damage, including encephalopathy. Immediate blood pressure control measures should be taken to prevent complications.

3. Pancreatitis: Although the CT abdomen did not show"
