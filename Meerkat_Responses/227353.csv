","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with symptoms of diarrhea, lethargy, headache, unsteady gait, chills, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), cirrhosis (possibly due to alcohol or cryptogenic), varices that were banded two months ago, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a past appendectomy. The patient also has allergies to nadolol, propranolol, and lidocaine with epinephrine.

The patient developed shock and respiratory failure after being admitted, and blood cultures grew Listeria. The patient's troponin level increased to 16, and an echo showed an ejection fraction of 15%. The patient's creatinine and liver function tests are rising. An abdominal CT scan revealed ascites, paracentesis was negative, and there were right lower lobe infiltrates and bilateral effusions. The patient is currently on pressors but they have been turned off. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient has been on three antibiotics, propofol infusion, and other ICU medications. The patient's allergies, medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except where noted above.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 108/"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male who was admitted with symptoms including diarrhea, lethargy, headache, unsteady gait, chills, and a possible history of consuming spoiled cheese dip. The patient's condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to shock and respiratory failure. Blood cultures revealed the presence of Listeria, and an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, indicating heart failure. Additionally, the patient has developed liver failure, as evidenced by elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and renal failure, indicated by rising creatinine levels. The patient also has ascites, bilateral effusions, and a right lower lobe infiltrate on the abdominal CT scan.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 95-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108-78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 96%, and a temperature of 36.2°C. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, high bilirubin levels, elevated liver enzymes, and signs of renal dysfunction. Imaging studies reveal an unremarkable chest X-ray with an endotracheal tube in place.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis (cause unknown), varices that were banded two months ago"

   [**5-6**] urine cx NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   This 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock,
   likely secondary to listeriosis.
   .
   *. Listeriosis, with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely from
   meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now
   off pressors.  At risk for brain abscesses but head CT yesterday w/o
   abscess.  No need for LP as would not change management at this point.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH
   - Continue ampicilin dose for Cr clearance. Holding on aminoglycoside
   given renal failure
   .
   *. Acute renal failure
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   - Check urine lytes, urinalysis
   - Spin urine in AM
   - Follow Cr daily, renally doses meds, holding diuretics
   - Continue bicarb, per d/w renal
   - Renal ultrasound
   - Renal consult pending
   .
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - RUQ ultrasound with dopplers
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Discuss with liver team
   .
   *. Troponin leak

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital with septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has shown clinical improvement and is now off pressors. His recent head CT did not reveal any brain abscesses. The patient has a history of diarrhea, which may have contributed to acute renal failure. He also has elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible transaminitis due to sepsis or medication toxicity. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating a possible troponin leak, and he has a low ejection fraction. Additionally, the patient experienced tachyarrhythmia, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. He has cool lower extremities, which may be related to vasopressor use or peripheral vascular disease. The patient's diabetes and hypertension are being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Brain Abscess: Although the recent head CT did not show any abscesses, the patient's symptoms of lethargy and confusion could still indicate a CNS infection. Further monitoring and reassessment are necessary.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's minimal urine output overnight and history of diarrhea suggest AKI. Daily monitoring of creatinine levels and renal function is important. Further evaluation with renal ultrasound and consultation with a renal specialist is warranted"

   This 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock,
   likely secondary to listeriosis.
   .
   *. Listeriosis, with bacteremia and septic shock
   Clinically improved, now off pressors. In setting of headaches consider
   whether he may have seeded CSF with consequent meningitis.
   - Needs repeat cultures as only had admit cultures at OSH
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH
   - Consider LP, though may be falsely negative now post abx
   - Continue ampicilin dose for Cr clearance. Holding on aminoglycoside
   given renal failure.
   .
   *. Acute renal failure
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   - Check urine lytes, urinalysis
   - Spin urine in AM
   - Follow Cr daily, renally doses meds, holding diuretics
   - Continue bicarb, per d/w renal
   - Renal ultrasound
   - Renal consult
   .
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis
   In setting of sepsis consider shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity,
   hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis
   less likely.
   - RUQ ultrasound with dopplers
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Discuss with liver team
   .
   *. Troponin leak
   Probably due to demand ischemia in setting of acute illness rather than
   a primary plaque rupture event. Both troponin elevation and depressed
   EF can be seen in setting of sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, would start low dose BB as BP tolerates
   - Repeat EKG here, monitor on telemetry
   - Repeat TTE here should also get repeat post resolution of acute
   illness
   .
   *. Tachyarrhythmia
   Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained BP at the time.
   Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and will start low dose metoprolol
   *. Altered mental status
   DDx includes worsening CNS infection given concern for listeria
   meningitis. Other possibilities include delirium in setting of system
   illness, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, med toxicity
   - Reassess mental status with weaning of sedation
   - Low threshold for MRI head r/o abscess if focal neuro findings
   - Lactulose TID
   - Discuss ?HD with renal, as above
   .
   * Respiratory failure
   Cause of his SOB at other hospital uncertain ?pulmonary edema related
   to MI, breathing off acidosis in setting of sepsis. Think pna less
   likely air bronchograms at OSH more likely [**1-25**] effusion.
   Gas c/w metabolic acidosis, breathing off lactate.
   - Increase PEEP given effusions, ascites. Will continue PSV, titrating
   up pressure this evening as needed.
   .
   * Cool lower extremities
   Improved today. Might be due to vasopressor use. Might have underlying
   PVD also.
   - Follow clinically, doppler exams
   .
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
   .
   *. HTN
   - Hold home antihypertensives in setting of sepsis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He has been intubated and sedated. The patient has shown clinical improvement and is now off pressors. However, there are concerns about potential complications such as meningitis, acute renal failure, transaminitis, troponin leak, tachyarrhythmia, altered mental status, respiratory failure, cool lower extremities, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient presented with septic shock likely due to listeriosis. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection and consider repeat cultures.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has oliguria (low urine output) and an elevated creatinine level, suggesting acute renal failure. Further evaluation is needed, including urine electrolytes, urinalysis, renal ultrasound, and consultation with a renal specialist.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to shock liver, medication toxicity, hepatic congestion, or acute infectious hepatitis. Monitoring liver function tests and considering an abdominal ultrasound with dopplers is recommended.
4. Troponin leak: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may be due to demand ischemia in the setting of acute illness rather than a primary"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock,
   likely secondary to listeriosis.
   .
   *. Listeriosis, with bacteremia and septic shock
   Clinically improved, now off pressors. In setting of headaches consider
   whether he may have seeded CSF with consequent meningitis.
   - Needs repeat cultures as only had admit cultures at OSH
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH
   - Consider LP, though may be falsely negative now post abx
   - Continue ampicilin dose for Cr clearance. Holding on aminoglycoside
   given renal failure.
   .
   *. Acute renal failure
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   - Check urine lytes, urinalysis
   - Spin urine in AM
   - Follow Cr daily, renally doses meds, holding diuretics
   - Continue bicarb, per d/w renal
   - Renal ultrasound
   - Renal consult
   .
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis
   In setting of sepsis consider shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity,
   hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis
   less likely.
   - RUQ ultrasound with dopplers
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Discuss with liver team
   .
   *. Troponin leak
   Probably due to demand ischemia in setting of acute illness rather than
   a primary plaque rupture event. Both troponin elevation and depressed
   EF can be seen in setting of sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, would start low dose BB as BP tolerates
   - Repeat EKG here, monitor on telemetry
   - Repeat TTE here should also get repeat post resolution of acute
   illness
   .
   *. Tachyarrhythmia
   Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained BP at the time.
   Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and will start low dose metoprolol
   *. Altered mental status
   DDx includes worsening CNS infection given concern for listeria
   meningitis. Other possibilities include delirium in setting of system
   illness, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, med toxicity
   - Reassess mental status with weaning of sedation
   - Low threshold for MRI head r/o abscess if focal neuro findings
   - Lactulose TID
   - Discuss ?HD with renal, as above
   .
   * Respiratory failure
   Cause of his SOB at other hospital uncertain ?pulmonary edema related
   to MI, breathing off acidosis in setting of sepsis. Think pna less
   likely air bronchograms at OSH more likely [**1-25**] effusion.
   Gas c/w metabolic acidosis, breathing off lactate.
   - Increase PEEP given effusions, ascites. Will continue PSV, titrating
   up pressure this evening as needed.
   .
   * Cool lower extremities
   Improved today. Might be due to vasopressor use. Might have underlying
   PVD also.
   - Follow clinically, doppler exams
   .
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
   .
   *. HTN
   - Hold home antihypertensives in setting of sepsis

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient is showing improvement and is no longer on pressors. However, there is a concern for possible meningitis due to headaches. Repeat cultures should be done as only admit cultures are available. Reculture if febrile, and consider a lumbar puncture (LP) to rule out meningitis. Continue ampicillin dose based on creatinine clearance and hold aminoglycoside due to renal failure.

2. Acute renal failure: The differential diagnosis includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and recent volume depletion from diarrhea, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) given cirrhosis, abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), and antibiotic-induced nephrotoxicity (AIN). Check urine electrolytes, urinalysis, and spin urine in the morning. Follow creatinine levels daily, adjust medication dosages based on renal function, continue bicarbonate administration, perform renal ultrasound, and consult a nephrologist.

3. Transaminitis: Consider shock liver in the setting of sepsis. Differential diagnosis includes medication toxicity, hepatic congestion due to low ejection fraction, and acute infectious hepatitis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His condition has improved, but he remains in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock likely due to listeriosis. Although his condition has improved, there is still a concern for potential complications such as meningitis.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. The possible causes include sepsis-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN), hepatic renal syndrome (HRS), dehydration from diarrhea, and medication toxicity.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to various causes such as septic shock, medication toxicity, hepatic congestion, or acute infectious hepatitis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
4. Troponin leak: The patient has elevated troponin levels, suggesting myocardial injury. This could be due to demand ischemia during acute illness rather than a primary cardiac event.
5. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient experienced a run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and has a low ejection fraction"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 114/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 213 mg/dL, and laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and hematocrit. The patient's renal function is impaired with an elevated blood urea nitrogen level and serum creatinine level. Liver function tests reveal elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes, indicating hepatic dysfunction. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with elevated potassium and low magnesium. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. The patient's neurological status is not assessed due to sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection, which may lead to further complications if not appropriately managed.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and low oxygen saturation indicate a risk for developing ARDS."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and alcoholism. He was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of sepsis, acute renal failure, and shock. The patient had eaten possibly spoiled cheese dip prior to the illness. His blood cultures grew listeria, indicating a possible case of listeriosis. The patient developed respiratory failure and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. He also experienced hypotension, requiring vasopressors, and had cool extremities, which have since improved.

The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with regular assessments of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values. His blood glucose levels have been controlled with insulin, and his diabetes medications have been held in favor of sliding scale insulin. His hypertension medications have also been held due to the sepsis.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, and he is now on dialysis. His liver function tests are abnormal, likely due to sepsis or hepatic congestion from a low ejection fraction. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15%, suggesting heart failure or cardiogenic shock. The patient's mental status has been altered, and he is at risk for worsening CNS infection, delirium, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, or medication toxicity.

The patient's respiratory support will continue, with plans to increase PEEP due to effusions and asc"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock,
   likely secondary to listeriosis.
   .
   *. Listeriosis, with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely from
   meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now
   off pressors.  At risk for brain abscesses but head CT yesterday w/o
   abscess.  No need for LP as would not change management at this point.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH
   - Continue ampicilin dose for Cr clearance. Holding on aminoglycoside
   given renal failure
   .
   *. Acute renal failure
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   - Check urine lytes, urinalysis
   - Spin urine in AM
   - Follow Cr daily, renally doses meds, holding diuretics
   - Continue bicarb, per d/w renal
   - Renal ultrasound
   - Renal consult pending
   .
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - RUQ ultrasound with dopplers
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Discuss with liver team
   .
   *. Troponin leak
   Probably due to demand ischemia in setting of acute illness rather than
   a primary plaque rupture event. Both troponin elevation and depressed
   EF can be seen in setting of sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, would start low dose BB as BP tolerates
   - Repeat EKG here, monitor on telemetry
   - Repeat TTE here should also get repeat post resolution of acute
   illness
   .
   *. Tachyarrhythmia
   Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained BP at the time.
   Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and will start low dose metoprolol
   *. Altered mental status
   DDx includes worsening CNS infection given concern for listeria
   meningitis. Other possibilities include delirium in setting of system
   illness, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, med toxicity
   - Reassess mental status with weaning of sedation
   - Low threshold for MRI head r/o abscess if focal neuro findings (will
   hold for now)
   - Lactulose TID
   - Discuss ?HD with renal, as above
   .
   * Respiratory failure
   Cause of his SOB at other hospital uncertain ?pulmonary edema related
   to MI, breathing off acidosis in setting of sepsis. Think pna less
   likely air bronchograms at OSH more likely [**1-25**] effusion.
   Gas c/w metabolic acidosis, breathing off lactate.
   - Increase PEEP given effusions, ascites. Will continue PSV, titrating
   up pressure this evening as needed.
   .
   * Cool lower extremities
   Improved today. Might be due to vasopressor use. Might have underlying
   PVD also.
   - Follow clinically, doppler exams
   .
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
   .
   *. HTN
   - Hold home antihypertensives in setting of sepsis

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis presenting to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has multiple medical complications that require monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Brain abscesses: The patient has a history of meningitis and altered mental status. Although a head CT scan was performed without evidence of abscess, there is still a risk for brain abscesses due to the ongoing infection. Close monitoring for any neurological changes is essential.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. The differential diagnosis includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis and volume depletion from diarrhea, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) given cirrhosis, and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) as a side effect of antibiotics. Renal function should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures such as urine analysis, renal ultrasound, and medication adjustment should be implemented.

3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to septic shock-induced liver injury or pre-existing liver disease. Further evaluation with abdominal ultrasound and monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is warranted.

4. Troponin leak: The patient has elevated troponin levels, suggesting myocardial injury. This may be related to demand ischemia during acute illness rather than a primary cardiac event. Continued monitoring of cardiac enzymes, EKG changes, and echocardiogram results is necessary.

5. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient experienced a run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and is at risk for further arrhythmias due to low ejection fraction, systemic infection, acid-base disturbance, and renal failure. Telemetry monitoring and initiation of low-dose beta-blockers are recommended.

6. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, and the differential diagnosis includes worsening central nervous system (CNS) infection, delirium, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and medication toxicity. Regular reassessment of mental status with weaning of sedation and consideration of imaging studies if focal neurological findings arise is important.

7. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation, and the cause of his respiratory failure is uncertain. Possible causes include pulmonary edema related to myocardial infarction, breathing off acidosis in sepsis, or pleural effusion. Adjustments to ventilation settings and further investigation are needed.

8. Cool lower extremities: The patient has improved lower extremity perfusion but may have underlying peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Clinical follow-up and doppler exams are recommended.

9. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's DM should be managed with insulin sliding scale and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis. They have a history of multiple comorbidities including acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). They have been started on antibiotics and are being closely monitored for any changes in their condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which indicates a systemic infection. There is a risk of further infections due to the invasive lines and procedures performed in the ICU.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction and is currently showing new anterior wall akinesis on echo. This indicates a potential risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation to support their breathing. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections.
4. Renal complications: The patient has acute renal failure and is receiving CRRT. There is a risk of worsening renal function or complications related to the dialysis catheter.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient may be at risk for stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding due to the critical illness and medications.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Imm"

   Blood ([**5-6**]):  NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   This 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock,
   likely secondary to listeriosis.
   .
   *. Listeriosis, with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely from
   meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now
   off pressors.  At risk for brain abscesses but head CT yesterday w/o
   abscess.  No need for LP as would not change management at this point.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Holding on aminoglycoside given
   renal failure
   * Anemia
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.
   .
   *. Acute renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Did not respond to 3L IVF yesterday and CVP was 20 after
   IJ placement.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now
   - appreciate continued renal input
   .
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - RUQ ultrasound with dopplers
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Discuss with liver team
   .
   *. Troponin leak
   Probably due to demand ischemia in setting of acute illness rather than
   a primary plaque rupture event. Both troponin elevation and depressed
   EF can be seen in setting of sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, would start low dose BB as BP tolerates
   - Repeat EKG here, monitor on telemetry
   - Repeat TTE here should also get repeat post resolution of acute
   illness
   .
   *. Tachyarrhythmia
   Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained BP at the time.
   Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and will start low dose metoprolol
   *. Altered mental status
   DDx includes worsening CNS infection given concern for listeria
   meningitis. Other possibilities include delirium in setting of system
   illness, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, med toxicity
   - Reassess mental status with weaning of sedation
   - Low threshold for MRI head r/o abscess if focal neuro findings (will
   hold for now)
   - Lactulose TID
   - Discuss ?HD with renal, as above
   .
   * Respiratory failure
   Cause of his SOB at other hospital uncertain ?pulmonary edema related
   to MI, breathing off acidosis in setting of sepsis. Think pna less
   likely air bronchograms at OSH more likely [**1-25**] effusion.
   Gas c/w metabolic acidosis, breathing off lactate.
   - Increase PEEP given effusions, ascites. Will continue PSV, titrating
   up pressure this evening as needed.
   .
   * Cool lower extremities
   Improved today. Might be due to vasopressor use. Might have underlying
   PVD also.
   - Follow clinically, doppler exams
   .
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
   .
   *. HTN
   - Hold home antihypertensives in setting of sepsis

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis. He presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He has been diagnosed with bacteremia and septic shock. The patient's condition has improved clinically, and he is now off pressors. He is at risk for brain abscesses but a head CT yesterday did not show any abscess. No need for lumbar puncture as it would not change the management at this point.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Listeriosis, with bacteremia and septic shock.
2. Brain abscesses.
3. Anemia.

   Blood ([**5-6**]):  NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   This 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock,
   likely secondary to listeriosis.
   .
   *. Listeriosis, with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely from
   meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now
   off pressors.  At risk for brain abscesses but head CT yesterday w/o
   abscess.  No need for LP as would not change management at this point.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH
   - Continue ampicilin dose for Cr clearance. Holding on aminoglycoside
   given renal failure
   Anemia
   Thrombocytopenia
   Gap acidosis
   .
   *. Acute renal failure
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   - Check urine lytes, urinalysis
   - Spin urine in AM
   - Follow Cr daily, renally doses meds, holding diuretics
   - Continue bicarb, per d/w renal
   - Renal ultrasound
   - Renal consult pending
   .
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - RUQ ultrasound with dopplers
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Discuss with liver team
   .
   *. Troponin leak
   Probably due to demand ischemia in setting of acute illness rather than
   a primary plaque rupture event. Both troponin elevation and depressed
   EF can be seen in setting of sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, would start low dose BB as BP tolerates
   - Repeat EKG here, monitor on telemetry
   - Repeat TTE here should also get repeat post resolution of acute
   illness
   .
   *. Tachyarrhythmia
   Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained BP at the time.
   Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and will start low dose metoprolol
   *. Altered mental status
   DDx includes worsening CNS infection given concern for listeria
   meningitis. Other possibilities include delirium in setting of system
   illness, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, med toxicity
   - Reassess mental status with weaning of sedation
   - Low threshold for MRI head r/o abscess if focal neuro findings (will
   hold for now)
   - Lactulose TID
   - Discuss ?HD with renal, as above
   .
   * Respiratory failure
   Cause of his SOB at other hospital uncertain ?pulmonary edema related
   to MI, breathing off acidosis in setting of sepsis. Think pna less
   likely air bronchograms at OSH more likely [**1-25**] effusion.
   Gas c/w metabolic acidosis, breathing off lactate.
   - Increase PEEP given effusions, ascites. Will continue PSV, titrating
   up pressure this evening as needed.
   .
   * Cool lower extremities
   Improved today. Might be due to vasopressor use. Might have underlying
   PVD also.
   - Follow clinically, doppler exams
   .
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
   .
   *. HTN
   - Hold home antihypertensives in setting of sepsis

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He has been admitted to the ICU and has shown some improvement. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given:

1. Brain abscesses: The patient presented with headache and lethargy, which are concerning for meningitis. Although a head CT was performed without evidence of abscess, the patient remains at risk for brain abscesses. Continuous monitoring and reassessment of mental status should be done, especially when weaning sedation.

2. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's blood work shows low hemoglobin and platelet count. Further investigation and management are needed to address these conditions.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury indicated by elevated creatinine levels and urine output. It is important to monitor renal function daily, adjust medication dosages based on creatinine clearance, and consider further diagnostic tests such as renal ultrasound and renal consultation.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to sepsis-related shock liver or medication toxicity. Trending liver function tests and considering an abdominal ultrasound with dopplers would be appropriate.

5. Troponin leak: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may be"

   renal failure
   * Anemia:  microcytic.  Acute 10 point drop in the setting of 3 L IVF
   yesterday.  No signs of GI bleed.  ? from DIC.
   - re-check and trend q 8 hrs for now
   - DIC labs
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  No signs of bleeding
   currently.  ? from DIC.
   - check DIC labs
   .
   * Seizures: likely from meningitis.  Now stopped on propofol.
   Responded to ativan 4 mg IVP.
   - neuro consult
   - EEG
   .
   *. Acute renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Did not respond to 3L IVF yesterday and CVP was 20 after
   IJ placement.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now
   - appreciate continued renal input
   .
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - RUQ ultrasound with dopplers
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Discuss with liver team

   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   Had elevated troponins here and at OSH probably due to demand ischemia
   in setting of acute illness rather than a primary plaque rupture event.
   Both troponin elevation and depressed EF can be seen in setting of

   DDx includes worsening CNS infection given concern for listeria
   meningitis. Other possibilities include delirium in setting of system
   illness, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, med toxicity or hypoxic
   encephalopathy.
   - Reassess mental status with weaning of sedation
   - Low threshold for MRI head r/o abscess if focal neuro findings (will

   * Respiratory failure: currently w/ minimal vent settings but cannot
   extubate given mental status.  Initial cause of respiratory failure
   unclear but CXR w/o obvious pulmonary process.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to an outside hospital (OSH) in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and seizures.
- The patient's current conditions include:
   1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock. He is off pressors and at risk for brain abscesses, but a head CT yesterday showed no abscess. No need for lumbar puncture (LP) at this point.
   2. Anemia with a 10-point drop, possibly from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or cirrhosis. Trending q 8 hours for now.
   3. Thrombocytopenia, likely from cirrhosis or possibly DIC. Checking DIC labs.
   4. Seizures, likely from meningitis, responded to ativan 4 mg IV. Neuro consult and EEG ordered.
   5. Acute renal failure, most likely from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension. CVVH initiated.
   6. Transaminitis, likely from sepsis-related shock liver. DDx includes medication toxicity, hepatic congestion, and acute infectious hepatitis. RUQ ultrasound with doppler"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of listeria bacteremia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is described as being critically ill. The patient has multiple medical complications including:

1. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has been diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction, specifically a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This is evident from the mention of cardiology consultation and medication management for NSTEMI.

2. Severe Sepsis: The patient presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeria bacteremia. Septic shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure.

3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory failure. This may be a result of the sepsis and underlying respiratory conditions.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from sepsis. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is being used for renal support.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which is a common complication in acute renal failure.

6. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has cirrhosis and is presenting with signs of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeria bacteremia. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and pancytopenia. He is also at risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and shock liver. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). His current vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's generalized tonic-clonic seizure during rounds raises concern for meningitis. This should be further evaluated with lumbar puncture, neurologic consultation, head CT, and EEG.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) at the outside hospital. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) should be continued for now, with renal follow-up and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely baseline due to sequestration. Bleeding should be monitored, and disseminated intravascular coag"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of confusion, headache, and diarrhea. The patient experienced two seizures on AM rounds, treated with lorazepam and propofol, as well as posturing overnight. The labs indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A CT scan of the head was performed to evaluate for any head bleed, but it came back negative. The patient's advanced endotracheal tube (ETT) was advanced, and they are on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has multiple medical complications including myocardial infarction, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and more. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachypnea. Fluid balance indicates an ongoing fluid deficit. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen.

The patient's blood work reveals elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated creatinine, low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Other lab results indicate renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's nutritional support includes tube feeding, and glycemic control is managed with a sliding scale of Humalog insulin. The patient has multiple lines including arterial, multi-lumen, and dialysis"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock,
   likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and
   seizures.
   .
   *. Listeriosis, with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely from
   meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now
   off pressors.  At risk for brain abscesses but head CT (noncontrast)
   w/o abscess.  No need for LP as would not change management at this
   point.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Holding on aminoglycoside given
   renal failure
   * Anemia:  microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - repeat fibrinogen today
   - f/u hct [**Hospital1 **], transfuse hb>7, T+S
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  No signs of bleeding
   currently.  ? from DIC.
   - Trending daily
   .
   * Seizures: likely from meningitis.  Now stopped on propofol.
   Responded to ativan 4 mg IVP.
   - neuro consult
   - EEG
   .
   *. Acute renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Did not respond to 3L IVF yesterday and CVP was 20 after
   IJ placement.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now
   - appreciate continued renal input
   .
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Discuss with liver team
   .
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   Had elevated troponins here and at OSH probably due to demand ischemia
   in setting of acute illness rather than a primary plaque rupture event.
   Both troponin elevation and depressed EF can be seen in setting of
   sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Repeat EKG here, monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate CV input
   .
   *. Tachyarrhythmia
   Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained BP at the time.
   Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   *. Seizures
   Pt had tonic clonic seziures on rounds yesterday, none sense. ?anoxic
   brain injury. also consider CNS listeria infection. CT head noncontrast
   without mass or abscess.
   - EEG
   - MRI head when stable
   - Seizure precautions
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   .
   * Respiratory failure: currently w/ minimal vent settings but cannot
   extubate given mental status.  Initial cause of respiratory failure
   unclear but CXR w/o obvious pulmonary process.
   .
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
   .
   *. HTN
   - Hold home antihypertensives in setting of sepsis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and seizures. 

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock. He is clinically improved but at risk for brain abscesses. A head CT scan was performed, which showed no abscess.

2. Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia and his hemoglobin levels have dropped since admission. He is stable on serial checks since yesterday, but there is a concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to a borderline fibrinogen level.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, which is likely due to cirrhosis. There is a question if this is also related to DIC.

4. Seizures: The patient experienced seizures likely from meningitis. He was treated with lorazepam and then propofol. An EEG and neuro consultation are pending.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), most likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension. Other differential diagnoses include hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and abdominal compartment syndrome, but these seem less likely. The patient is currently on continuous"

   failure and seizures.
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely from
   meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now
   off pressors.  At risk for brain abscesses but head CT (noncontrast)
   w/o abscess.  No need for LP as would not change management at this
   point.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Holding on aminoglycoside given
   renal failure
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.  In setting of sepsis
   likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic congestion
   in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone

   Both troponin elevation and depressed EF can be seen in setting of
   sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained
   BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection,
   acid base disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for septic shock secondary to listeriosis. He presented with symptoms of meningitis, including headache and lethargy. The patient's condition has improved, and he is now off pressors. However, he is at risk for brain abscesses, but a head CT scan was negative. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient will be recultured if febrile or if the initial cultures are negative.

The patient also has acute oliguric renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension. He is not fluid responsive, and there are no signs of abdominal compartment syndrome. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) is being initiated.

The patient has transaminitis, likely from ""shock liver"" in the setting of sepsis. Other potential causes include medication toxicity, hepatic congestion, or acute infectious hepatitis. Liver function tests will be trended daily, and albumin will be continued as recommended by hepatology.

The patient experienced seizures, which may be due to anoxic brain injury or CNS listeria infection. An electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head will be done when the patient is stable.

The patient has systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15"

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to an outside hospital (OSH) in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and seizures. The patient has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/59 mmHg to 83/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 5.5 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 140 mg/dL, hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 152 mg/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 55, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 417/492), and elevated bilirubin levels (Total: 3.0 mg/dL). The patient also has an elevated creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL and a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 18 mL/min.

Imaging studies reveal no acute intracranial hemorrhage or large mass on a noncontrast CT scan of the head. The chest X-ray shows hilar fullness"

   Assessment and Plan
   This 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock,
   likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and
   seizures.
   .
   *. Listeriosis, with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely from
   meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now
   off pressors.  At risk for brain abscesses but head CT (noncontrast)
   w/o abscess.  No need for LP as would not change management at this
   point.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Holding on aminoglycoside given
   renal failure
   * Anemia:  microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - repeat fibrinogen today
   - f/u hct [**Hospital1 **], transfuse hb>7, T+S
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  No signs of bleeding
   currently.  ? from DIC.
   - Trending daily
   .
   * Seizures: likely from meningitis.  Now stopped on propofol.
   Responded to ativan 4 mg IVP.
   - neuro consult
   - EEG
   .
   *. Acute renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Did not respond to 3L IVF yesterday and CVP was 20 after
   IJ placement.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now
   - appreciate continued renal input
   .
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Discuss with liver team
   .
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   Had elevated troponins here and at OSH probably due to demand ischemia
   in setting of acute illness rather than a primary plaque rupture event.
   Both troponin elevation and depressed EF can be seen in setting of
   sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Repeat EKG here, monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate CV input
   .
   *. Tachyarrhythmia
   Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained BP at the time.
   Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   *. Seizures
   Pt had tonic clonic seziures on rounds yesterday, none sense. ?anoxic
   brain injury. also consider CNS listeria infection. CT head noncontrast
   without mass or abscess.
   - EEG
   - MRI head when stable
   - Seizure precautions
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   .
   * Respiratory failure: currently w/ minimal vent settings but cannot
   extubate given mental status.  Initial cause of respiratory failure
   unclear but CXR w/o obvious pulmonary process.
   .
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
   .
   *. HTN
   - Hold home antihypertensives in setting of sepsis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with listeria bacteremia, respiratory failure, unresponsiveness, and multiple medical complications. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic injury: The patient's unresponsiveness of unclear etiology raises concern for anoxic injury. An EEG has been ordered to further evaluate this possibility.
2. Seizure: The patient has had multiple episodes of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. If needed, seizure suppression will be managed while the patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).
3. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent myocardial infarction (MI). Medical management, including medication adjustments, will be continued.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing tachypnea with alkalemia. ventilator settings may need to be adjusted to improve respiratory function.
5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is likely experiencing ARF, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is ongoing.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, which need to be carefully monitored and managed.
7. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has evidence of hepatic dysfunction, which can lead to encephalopathy. App"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of listeriosis and unresponsiveness. The patient has multiple medical complications including myocardial infarction (MI), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Unresponsiveness: The patient is unresponsive, which raises concerns for anoxic injury, and there is a possibility of seizure activity. An EEG is awaiting to further evaluate the situation. An MRI will be done when the patient is more stable, and neurology will be involved in the management.
- Ischemic cardiomyopathy/recent MI: The patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy and recently experienced a myocardial infarction. Medical management is being provided, and metoprolol will be increased in dose and holding parameters adjusted.
- Septic shock: The patient is being treated for the cause of septic shock and is receiving supportive care with blood products.
- Respiratory failure: The patient has tachypnea with alkalemia, and efforts are being made to try smaller volumes or pressure support.
- Acute renal failure/atn: The patient is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (cvvh) for acute renal failure.
- Goals of care: Ongoing family discussion is taking place to determine the patient's goals of care.

   failure and seizures.
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely from
   meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now
   off pressors.  At risk for brain abscesses but head CT (noncontrast)
   w/o abscess.  No need for LP as would not change management at this
   point.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Holding on aminoglycoside given
   renal failure
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.  In setting of sepsis
   likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic congestion
   in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   *. Seizures.  Pt had tonic clonic seziures on rounds yesterday, none

   noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   - EEG
   - MRI head when stable
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Off propofol
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   Had elevated troponins here and at OSH probably due to demand ischemia
   in setting of acute illness rather than a primary plaque rupture event.
   Both troponin elevation and depressed EF can be seen in setting of
   sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained
   BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection,
   acid base disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiorgan system failure and seizures. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, acute renal failure, shock liver, systolic heart failure, and anemia. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of arterial and multi-lumen lines, dialysis catheter, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain Abscess: The patient presented with lethargy and headache, which are suggestive of meningitis caused by Listeria. Although a noncontrast head CT was performed and ruled out abscess formation, the patient remains at risk for developing brain abscesses due to the ongoing infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is experiencing oliguric renal failure, which can be attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension and recent volume depletion from diarrhea. Other possible causes include hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and antibiotic-induced nephrotoxicity (AIN). CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) is being utilized for renal support.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with multiple acute conditions including altered mental status, acute renal failure, shock liver, and systolic heart failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions such as MRI, EKG, sedation, antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, dopamine, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), and renal replacement therapy.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV and receiving supplemental oxygen. The ABG results indicate a slightly elevated pH level and normal PaO2/FiO2 ratio.

The lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, troponin-T, ALT, AST, lactate, and LDH. The WBC count is within normal range. The imaging shows proper placement of the ET tube and NG tube, as well as stable cardiomediastinal silhouette but presence of bibasal atelectasis.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including myocardial infarction, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and others.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding, glycemic control with regular insulin, and various prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention, stress ulcer"

   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   * Altered mental status
   Probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy
   Minimally interactive off of sedatives
   - Neurology input appreciated, will discuss utility of LP
   - EEG today
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   - EEG
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Change from Keppra to dilantin, follow dilantin levels
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now off
   pressors.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Holding on aminoglycoside given
   renal failure
   - Will ask for ID input. ?Role for TMP-SMX
   - Follow lactate daily
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now. Goal net even to +500cc positive.
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.  In setting of sepsis
   likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic congestion
   in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC). Check D bili today.
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   Had elevated troponins here and at OSH probably due to demand ischemia
   in setting of acute illness rather than a primary plaque rupture event.
   Both troponin elevation and depressed EF can be seen in setting of
   sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Repeat fibrinogen today. No active bleeding.
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained
   BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection,
   acid base disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.
   - DIC labs daily
   * Respiratory failure: currently w/ minimal vent settings but cannot
   extubate given mental status.  Initial cause of respiratory failure
   unclear but CXR w/o obvious pulmonary process. [**Month (only) 8**] have had pulmonary
   edema in setting of MI, or became tachypneic in setting of overwhelming
   infection.
   -  PSV trial
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and seizures. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is minimally interactive off of sedatives, possibly due to CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy. Neurology input is appreciated, and an EEG today is planned.

2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, possibly due to CNS listeria infection. An EEG is planned, and lorazepam (Ativan) will be given as needed. The patient's antiepileptic medication will be changed from Keppra to dilantin, with follow-up of dilantin levels.

3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient likely has meningitis as well. Blood cultures are pending with NGTD, and the patient will be recultured if febrile. Follow-up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities will be sought, and ID input is appreciated.

4. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient is most likely experiencing ATN due to hypotension. He is not fluid responsive, and CVVH has been initiated. The differential diagnosis includes ATN in the setting of sepsis and recent"

         >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   BUDDING YEAST
   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely from
   meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now
   off pressors.  At risk for brain abscesses but head CT (noncontrast)
   w/o abscess.  No need for LP as would not change management at this
   point.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Holding on aminoglycoside given
   renal failure
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.  In setting of sepsis
   likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic congestion
   in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   *. Seizures.  Pt had tonic clonic seziures on rounds yesterday, none
   sense. ?due to anoxic brain injury,  CNS listeria infection. CT head
   noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   - EEG
   - MRI head when stable
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Off propofol
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   Had elevated troponins here and at OSH probably due to demand ischemia
   in setting of acute illness rather than a primary plaque rupture event.
   Both troponin elevation and depressed EF can be seen in setting of
   sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained
   BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection,
   acid base disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.
   - DIC labs daily
   * Respiratory failure: currently w/ minimal vent settings but cannot
   extubate given mental status.  Initial cause of respiratory failure
   unclear but CXR w/o obvious pulmonary process. [**Month (only) 8**] have had pulmonary
   edema in setting of MI, or became tachypneic in setting of overwhelming
   infection.
   -  PSV trial
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
   *. HTN
   - Hold home antihypertensives in setting of sepsis

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multi-organ system failure and seizures. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Brain abscesses: The patient had meningitis symptoms, which can lead to brain abscesses. However, a noncontrast head CT did not show any abscesses.
2. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute kidney injury due to hypotension and possibly sepsis. This can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which can be due to shock liver in the setting of sepsis or other causes such as medication toxicity or hepatic congestion.
4. Seizures: The patient has had tonic-clonic seizures, which could be due to anoxic brain injury, CNS listeria infection, or other causes. Further evaluation with EEG and MRI head when stable is recommended.
5. Systolic heart failure: The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF 15%), indicating systolic heart failure, possibly from a recent or remote myocardial infarction.
6. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient had a run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and is at risk for further arrhythmias due to low EF, systemic infection, and acid-base disturbance.
7. Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia, likely due to blood loss from gastrointestinal bleeding or chronic disease.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, which may be due to cirrhosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
9. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on minimal ventilator settings but cannot be extubated due to altered mental status. The initial cause of respiratory failure is unclear, but pulmonary edema or infection are possibilities.
10. Diabetes management: The patient's diabetes should be managed with insulin sliding scale and avoidance of home metformin.
11. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension should be managed by holding home antihypertensive medications in the setting of sepsis.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history. It is important to monitor and manage these complications appropriately."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with listeria bacteremia, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. He is unresponsive and has a history of encephalopathy. The patient has multiple medical complications including myocardial infarction, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and congestive heart failure. The patient is on various medications and treatments such as antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, sedatives, and renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction (heart attack) which can lead to cardiac complications like arrhythmias and heart failure.
2. Severe Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient has listeria bacteremia, which can progress to severe sepsis and cause organ dysfunction, including respiratory, renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular systems.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) if secretions change.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). There is a risk of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can be life-threatening and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with listeria bacteremia and altered mental status, currently unresponsive. The patient has several medical complications including myocardial infarction, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and likely meningitis and cerebritis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Myocardial infarction: The patient may experience further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or development of a new myocardial infarction.

2. Severe sepsis: The patient is at risk of experiencing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which can lead to failure of other vital organs such as the kidneys, liver, or lungs.

3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient may require prolonged mechanical ventilation support and is at risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory infections.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient may need ongoing renal replacement therapy, such as continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), and is at risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

5. Hyperkalemia: The patient is at risk of life-threatening arrhythmias due to the high levels of potassium in the blood.

6. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient may continue to experience altered mental"

   1. Diffuse FLAIR hyperintensity within the sulci and cortical ribbon in
   a
   gyriform pattern. This can be seen with infectious processes such as
   meningitis with associated cerebritis and malignancy such as lymphoma.
   Lumbar
   puncture is recommended to further assess.
   2. Questionable subacute infarct in the left lateral occipital cortex.
   3. Findings likely representing a right superolateral orbital dermoid.
   Sputum [**5-9**]: OP flora, budding yeast

   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-9**], the monitoring and
   support
   devices remain in place. The side hole of the nasogastric tube again
   lies at
   the level of the gastroesophageal junction or slightly below it. There
   may be
   some increasing atelectasis at the left base with continued minimal
   atelectasis on the right
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   * Altered mental status
   Probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy
   Minimally interactive off of sedatives
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   .
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   EEG showed persistent seizure activity.
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, check regular and free dilantin levels
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now off
   pressors.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Hold on LP for now given hemodynamic
   instability
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension, Question of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency also a possibility. On levophed currently
   - Consider checking cortisol level
   - Check MVO2
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60
   - Follow lactate daily
   .
   * Ventilator acquired pneumonia, suspected
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - Repeat sputum gram stain and culture
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, 50cc/hr off
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC). Check D bili today.
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Repeat fibrinogen tomorrow. No active bleeding.
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained
   BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection,
   acid base disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.
   - DIC labs daily
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and seizures. The patient's conditions include altered mental status, seizures, hypotension, suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia, acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure with an EF of 15%, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The clinical team has started appropriate antibiotics and is monitoring for signs of infection.
2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be due to CNS listeria infection. The neurology team is monitoring the patient closely, and antiepileptic drugs like lorazepam and phenytoin have been initiated.
3. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not producing enough urine, leading to renal failure. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been started to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, necessitating the use of norepine"

   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   * Altered mental status
   Probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy
   Minimally interactive off of sedatives
   - Neurology input appreciated, will discuss utility of LP
   - EEG today
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   - EEG
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Change from Keppra to dilantin, follow dilantin levels
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now off
   pressors.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Holding on aminoglycoside given
   renal failure
   - Will ask for ID input. ?Role for TMP-SMX
   - Follow lactate daily
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now. Goal net even to +500cc positive.
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.  In setting of sepsis
   likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic congestion
   in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC). Check D bili today.
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   Had elevated troponins here and at OSH probably due to demand ischemia
   in setting of acute illness rather than a primary plaque rupture event.
   Both troponin elevation and depressed EF can be seen in setting of
   sepsis alone, however.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Repeat fibrinogen today. No active bleeding.
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained
   BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection,
   acid base disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.
   - DIC labs daily
   * Respiratory failure: currently w/ minimal vent settings but cannot
   extubate given mental status.  Initial cause of respiratory failure
   unclear but CXR w/o obvious pulmonary process. [**Month (only) 8**] have had pulmonary
   edema in setting of MI, or became tachypneic in setting of overwhelming
   infection.
   -  PSV trial
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
   *. HTN
   - Hold home antihypertensives in setting of sepsis

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is now experiencing multi-organ failure and seizures. The patient's medical history includes myocardial infarction, bacterial meningitis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and congestive heart failure. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, bacterial meningitis, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and congestive heart failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be due to CNS listeria infection.
2. Listeriosis: The patient has a confirmed case of listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
3. Acute Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, likely from shock liver or medication toxicity.
5. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15% from recent or remote myocardial infarction.
6. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has evidence of DIC, including low"

   MRI head
   1. Diffuse FLAIR hyperintensity within the sulci and cortical ribbon in
   a
   gyriform pattern. This can be seen with infectious processes such as
   meningitis with associated cerebritis and malignancy such as lymphoma.
   Lumbar
   puncture is recommended to further assess.
   2. Questionable subacute infarct in the left lateral occipital cortex.
   3. Findings likely representing a right superolateral orbital dermoid.
   Sputum [**5-9**]: OP flora, budding yeast
   Blood cx [**5-6**], [**5-10**]: NGTD
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-9**], the monitoring and
   support
   devices remain in place. The side hole of the nasogastric tube again
   lies at
   the level of the gastroesophageal junction or slightly below it. There
   may be
   some increasing atelectasis at the left base with continued minimal
   atelectasis on the right
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   * Altered mental status
   Probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy
   Minimally interactive off of sedatives
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   .
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   EEG showed persistent seizure activity.
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, check regular and free dilantin levels
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now off
   pressors.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Hold on LP for now given hemodynamic
   instability
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension, Question of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency also a possibility. On levophed currently
   - Consider checking cortisol level
   - Check MVO2
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60
   - Follow lactate daily
   .
   * Ventilator acquired pneumonia, suspected
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - Repeat sputum gram stain and culture
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, 50cc/hr off
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC). Check D bili today.
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Repeat fibrinogen tomorrow. No active bleeding.
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had run of likely NSVT last evening, maintained
   BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection,
   acid base disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.
   - DIC labs daily
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and seizures. The patient is intubated and sedated, with persistent seizure activity on EEG.

Medical Complications:

1. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, possibly due to CNS listeria infection. He is currently on dilantin, and regular and free dilantin levels should be monitored.

2. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient likely had meningitis and clinically improved, but further evaluation is needed. ID recommendations include adding TMP-SMX for synergy and considering a 6-week CNS course of treatment.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to various factors including medications (e.g., ativan, dilantin), sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function, adrenal insufficiency, or other causes. Levophed is currently being used to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and cortisol levels should be checked.

4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is suspected to have VAP, and vancomycin and zosyn are being continued. Repeat sputum gram stain and culture are pending.

5. Acute oliguric renal failure: This is likely due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall male with a weight of 240 pounds, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status and seizures. The patient has a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus. He presented with fever, confusion, and focal neurological deficits, suggestive of meningitis. Laboratory results indicated bacterial meningitis, and a CT scan showed multiple embolic strokes.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the following medical complications can arise:
1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms of fever, confusion, and focal neurological deficits are consistent with bacterial meningitis. Prompt treatment is essential to prevent further complications such as septic shock, hearing loss, or cognitive impairment.
2. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, which increases his risk for MI. The presence of chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, and changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG) may indicate an acute MI. Timely intervention is crucial to minimize cardiac damage.
3. Sepsis: Bacterial meningitis can lead to sepsis, especially if not promptly treated. Signs of sepsis include fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. Early recognition and aggressive management are vital to prevent organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. This can occur as a"

   Comments:
   Communication: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds , ICU
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. They have been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, acute myocardial infarction, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is intubated and sedated, requiring mechanical ventilation. They are receiving various medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. The patient's condition is monitored closely with frequent laboratory tests and imaging studies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Measures such as head of bed elevation, daily wake-up trials, and regular mouth care are being implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and possibly low molecular weight heparin should be considered.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI): Given the multiple lines and catheters in place, there is a risk of developing CRBSI. Central line dressing changes and careful catheter management are crucial in preventing this complication.
4. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
5. Complications related to sepsis and organ dysfunction: The patient's severe sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) pose risks for further deterioration, including organ failure and death.
6. Myocardial ischemia and heart failure: Given the patient's recent acute myocardial infarction, there is a risk of recurrent ischemic events and heart failure.
7. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing acute renal failure may worsen due to ongoing hypotension, nephrotoxic medications, or sepsis.
8. Hepatic encephalopathy exacerbation: The patient's hepatic dysfunction increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy exacerbation, which can lead to altered mental status and increased morbidity and mortality.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's clinical status and adjust treatment accordingly to minimize the risk of these potential complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of unresponsiveness. The patient has been diagnosed with listeria sepsis, bacteremia, and likely meningitis, along with NSTEMI and CHF. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizures: The patient has experienced seizures, which may be related to the listeria meningitis or other underlying conditions. Continuous EEG monitoring is recommended to monitor for any further seizure activity.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, daily wake-up trials, and respiratory system bilirubin interpretation (RSBI) will be implemented to reduce the risk.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), possibly due to sepsis, hypotension, or cardiomyopathy. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) is being performed to manage renal function.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has liver dysfunction, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring liver function tests and treating with lactulose will be important to manage this condition.

5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy, which may contribute to his current hypotension and NSTEM"

   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   .
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   EEG showed persistent seizure activity.
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Hold on LP for now given hemodynamic
   instability
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (now w/ low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with
   cardiogenic than septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect
   this).
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency also a possibility. On levophed currently
   - Consider checking cortisol level in am if still on pressors
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   .
   * r/o Ventilator acquired pneumonia
   Sputum without pathogen identified yet. Temp curve improving on
   antibiotics
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn x8d course (d1 = [**5-10**])
   - Follow up pending cultures and CIS
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, 50cc/hr off
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC). Check D bili today.
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding.
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.
   - DIC labs daily

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and seizures. 

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Altered mental status: This persists without signs of improvement, which is likely multifactorial involving CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, possibly due to CNS listeria infection. CT head without mass or abscess and EEG showed persistent seizure activity.
3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: Blood cultures are pending, and antibiotics have been started for a 6-week course.
4. Hypotension: The cause of hypotension is unclear, but it may be related to sepsis, medications (such as ativan and dilantin), volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function, or adrenal insufficiency.
5. r/o Ventilator acquired pneumonia: Sputum cultures are pending, and antibiotics have been continued.
6. Acute oliguric renal failure: This is most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension. CVVH has been initiated.
7. Transaminitis: LFTs have been trending down in the setting of sepsis and history of cirrhosis.
8. Systolic heart failure with EF"

   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   * Altered mental status
   Probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy
   Minimally interactive off of sedatives
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   .
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   EEG showed persistent seizure activity.
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, check regular and free dilantin levels
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.  Clinically improved, now off
   pressors.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Hold on LP for now given hemodynamic
   instability
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension, Question of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia
   Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than septic etiology
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency also a possibility. On levophed currently
   - Consider checking cortisol level
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   .
   * r/o Ventilator acquired pneumonia
   Sputum without pathogen identified yet. Temp curve improving on
   antibiotics
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn x8d course
   - Follow up pending cultures and CIS
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, 50cc/hr off
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC). Check D bili today.
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Repeat fibrinoge. No active bleeding.
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.
   - DIC labs daily
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and seizures. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, likely due to CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, potential ventilator-associated pneumonia, acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure with low ejection fraction, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus. The patient is being treated with various medications and interventions to manage his conditions, including antibiotics, antiepileptics, vasoactive agents, renal replacement therapy, nutritional support, and prophylactic measures. The patient's current code status is full code, and he remains in the ICU for continued care and monitoring. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of multiorgan system failure, development of further infections, progression of heart failure, exacerbation of renal failure, worsening of liver function, and complications related to diabetes management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of listeria bacteremia and possible meningitis. He is unresponsive with persistent seizure activity, likely due to meningitis or anoxic brain injury. The patient has a history of allergies to nadolol, propranolol, and lidocaine Hcl/epinephrine. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics for his infection, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), Bactrim (SMX/TMP), ampicillin, and vancomycin. The patient is currently on several infusions, including norepinephrine and calcium gluconate (CRRT). Other medications being administered include lansoprazole (Prevacid), risperidone (Riss), thiamine, multivitamins (MV), fluoroquinolones (FA), albumin IV, lansoprazole, aspirin (ASA), ampicillin, lactulose, norepinephrine, phenytoin (Dilantin), and zosyn. The patient's medical, social, and family history remains unchanged except for the mentioned conditions above. The review of systems is also unchanged except as noted below.

Vital signs as of 10:15 AM on [**2134-5-12**] include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate of 70 bpm with normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 112/62 to 125/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 22 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2%) ranging from 63-63%, and fluid balance with a net output of 10,175 mL and net input of 3,986 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The results of arterial blood gas analysis show pH 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 35 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 408 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) 24 mEq/L, base excess (BE) -2 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) 99%. 

Physical examination findings include an endotracheal tube in place, warm skin, distended abdomen, and bilateral peripheral pulses present. Neurological examination reveals no attentive response, no follow-up of simple commands, and no oriented response. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with white blood cell (WBC) count of 9.4 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 35 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of listeria bacteremia and possible meningitis. He is currently unresponsive with persistent seizure activity, likely due to meningitis or anoxic brain injury from septic shock. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, Bactrim, ampicillin, and vancomycin. He is receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine and calcium gluconate through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient's medical history includes allergies to nadolol, propranolol, and lidocaine Hcl/epinephrine. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 112/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and potassium levels, with decreased platelet count, creatinine, and total CO2 levels. Imaging reveals worsening effusions on chest X-ray. The patient is being treated for bacterial meningitis, acute myocardial infarction, severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and possible listeria meningitis.

   Imaging:
   [**5-12**] CXR
   TECHNIQUE: Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed.
   Comparison is made with prior radiograph of [**2134-5-11**].
   FINDINGS:
   The ET tube has its tip approximately 46 mm from the carina. The NG
   tube has
   its tip projected over the stomach. The right-sided central venous line
   has
   its tip projected over the right atrium. The lungs are of low volume.
   There
   is increased density over the lower right hemithorax most likely
   attributable
   to patient rotation and a probale layering pleural effusion. There is
   minimal
   atelectasis at the lung bases. There is no focal pulmonary
   consolidation. The
   cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
   CONCLUSION:
   Minimal bibasilar atelectasis and a small right basal effusion.
   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   .
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   EEG showed persistent seizure activity.
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Hold on LP for now given hemodynamic
   instability
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (now w/ low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with
   cardiogenic than septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect
   this).
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency also a possibility. On levophed currently
   - Consider checking cortisol level in am if still on pressors
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   .
   * r/o Ventilator acquired pneumonia
   Sputum without pathogen identified yet. Temp curve improving on
   antibiotics
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn x8d course (d1 = [**5-10**])
   - Follow up pending cultures and CIS
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, 50cc/hr off
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC). Check D bili today.
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding.
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be due to a combination of factors including CNS listeria infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy.

2. Renal failure: The patient is oliguric (producing little urine) and has acute kidney injury (ATN) likely due to hypotension. Other possible causes include sepsis, recent volume depletion from diarrhea, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and antibiotic-induced nephrotoxicity (AIN).

3. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be caused by CNS listeria infection. The patient is currently on antiepileptic drugs (dilantin and phenobarbital) for seizure management.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the cause is unclear. Possible contributors include sepsis, medications (such as ativan and dilantin), volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), poor cardiac pump function, and adrenal insufficiency.

5. Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation. Sputum cultures are pending, and appropriate antibiotics are being administered.

6. Liver dysfunction: The patient has transaminitis, which is likely secondary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male with a chief complaint of encephalopathy, renal failure, seizures, and hypotension. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has been experiencing continued seizures this morning and has been given additional 400mg of Dilantin per neuro recommendations. Zosyn (Piperacillin/Tazobactam) was discontinued due to the potential lowering of the seizure threshold, per ID consultation. The patient was loaded with phenobarbital for burst suppression per neuro recommendations.

The patient has allergies to Nadolol, Propranolol, and Lidocaine Hcl/Epinephrine (Injection), which cause palpitations. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam on 05/12/2134 at 12:00 AM, Vancomycin on 05/12/2134 at 08:30 AM, Ampicillin on 05/13/2134 at 02:00 AM, and Bactrim (SMX/TMP) on 05/13/2134 at 04:00 AM.

The patient is currently on several infusions, including Norepinephrine at 0.07 mcg/Kg/min, Calcium Gluconate (CRRT) at 1.4 grams/hour, Propofol at 20 mcg/Kg/min, and KCl (CR"

   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Hold on LP for now given hemodynamic
   instability
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (now w/ low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with
   cardiogenic than septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect
   this).
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency also a possibility. On levophed currently
   - Consider checking cortisol level in am if still on pressors
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   .
   * r/o Ventilator acquired pneumonia
   Sputum without pathogen identified yet. Temp curve improving on
   antibiotics
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn x8d course (d1 = [**5-10**])
   - Follow up pending cultures and CIS
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, 50cc/hr off
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC). Check D bili today.
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding.
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.
   - DIC labs daily
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis, now with multiorgan system failure and seizures. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient has persistent altered mental status without signs of improvement, which is likely multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy.

2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures that may be due to CNS listeria infection. An EEG showed persistent seizure activity, and the patient is currently on dilantin, with regular and free dilantin levels being monitored.

3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient has a suspected case of listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is being treated with ampicillin for a six-week course.

4. Hypotension: The patient has unclear etiology hypotension, which seems most consistent with sepsis (now with low-grade fevers on CVVH). Multiple possible contributors include medications (e.g., ativan, dilantin), sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function, adrenal insufficiency, and more. Levophed is currently being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60.

5. Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation (CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow), with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 18, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and spontaneous RR of 7. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 360, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 12 L/min.

6. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension. The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with a blood flow rate of 50 cc/hr.

7. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis with elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to septic shock liver, medication toxicity, hepatic congestion, or other causes. Albumin is being administered at 50 mg/kg per hepatology recommendations.

8. Systolic heart failure: The patient has systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15% from either recent or remote myocardial infarction. The patient is on aspirin (ASA) and beta-block"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of EtOH, listeria bacteremia, persistent seizures, possible from listeria meningitis, and a previous myocardial infarction (MI). The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including ineffective coping, bacterial meningitis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and sepsis with organ dysfunction. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 119/64 (80) mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and a temperature of 35.9°C. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including propofol, dilantin, phenobarbital, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), and various antibiotics.

The patient's lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, blood glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and other markers of organ dysfunction. Imaging studies reveal an endotracheal tube at the thoracic inlet.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of seizures, meningitis, hypotension, respiratory failure, renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and sepsis with organ dysfunction. Treatment plans involve adjusting"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, listeria bacteremia, and possible bacterial meningitis. He is currently experiencing seizures, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, myocardial infarction, and severe sepsis. The patient has been treated with multiple medications including propofol, dilantin, phenobarbital, antibiotics, and CVVH. He has a distended abdomen due to underlying cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and his cardiac function is compromised with an ejection fraction of 15%. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has been experiencing seizures, possibly caused by listeria meningitis or hypoxic brain injury from shock. It is concerning that three agents are required to prevent seizure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory failure. The current ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. CVVH has been initiated to manage renal function.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ineffective coping: The patient is experiencing difficulty in coping with their illness, which can lead to increased stress and potentially worsen their overall condition.

2. Bacterial meningitis: The patient has a confirmed listeria bacteremia and persistent seizures, possibly due to listeria meningitis. This requires ongoing treatment with appropriate antibiotics.

3. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): The patient has evidence of an anterior wall myocardial infarction with a low ejection fraction (EF 15%) and elevated troponin levels. Management options are limited due to the patient's hypotension.

4. Severe sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient is experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, as indicated by their respiratory failure, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and other systemic signs of infection.

5. Acute respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support, and their respiratory status needs close monitoring to prevent further deterioration.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and they are undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to manage their renal failure.

7. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high potassium levels, which can be life-threatening and requires careful management.

   with MRI showing evidence of cerebritis as a likely cause. Now with
   seizures yesterday on dilantin (phenobarb was added)
   - Currently on propofol, dilantin and phenobarb. ? can we d/c propofol
   will try to determine whether had seizure last night prior to making
   changes. It is concerning if three agents are required to prevent
   seizure.
   - Clarify with neurology repeat  imaging modality and ? need to repeat
   LP. Will proceed ro MRI with gadolinium
   - Cont abx: ampicillin, vancomycin, bactrim for ? of listeria
   meningitis (on MRI).  Will stop Vancomycin today (was for VAP)
   - ongoing discussion about etiology ( ? neuronal hypoixemia)
   - cont thiamine, folate
   - phenobarbitol level tonight
   >hypotension: with low ef could be [**1-25**] CVVH,  propofol and/or
   phenobarb. No new infectious source obvious, cortisol level  was normal
   -requiring low dose pressors, will try to wean as the propofol comes
   off

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse and listeria bacteremia.
- The patient has been experiencing persistent seizures, possibly due to listeria meningitis and cerebritis.
- The patient's seizures were initially controlled with dilantin but required the addition of phenobarbital.
- The patient is currently on propofol, dilantin, and phenobarbital.
- Imaging modalities and repeat LP are needed to determine the cause of the seizures.
- The patient is being treated with antibiotics for suspected listeria meningitis.
- The patient's hypotension may be due to low EF and CVVH, and phenobarbital could also be a contributing factor.
- The patient's renal function is stable on CVVH.
- The patient has a distended abdomen with a history of underlying cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
- The patient's DIC is improving, but further evaluation is needed.
- The cause of the myocardial infarction is unclear.
- The patient's condition is severe, and management options are limited.
- The patient's nutritional needs are being met through enteral feeding.
- Glycemic control is being maintained with regular insulin sliding scale.
- The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place for monitoring and treatment.
- Prophylactic measures are being taken to prevent DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

   There is minimal bilateral pleural effusion that is most likely
   present. No
   pneumothorax has been demonstrated.
   MRI pending
   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - attempt to wean propofol
   - lactulose
   - MRI today
   .
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   EEG showed persistent seizure activity.  NO seizures currently
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - started Phenobarbital, switch to PO this AM, follow levels next on
   [**5-16**]
   - discuss with neuro re: no LP for now
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (now w/ low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with
   cardiogenic than septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect
   this).
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency also a possibility. On levophed currently.  Ran even on
   CVVH, Levophed lower today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Cont to run CVVH even as levophed requirement appears lower
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down and cont to do so
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding.  Fibrino is increasing currently
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.  Stable
   - DIC labs daily
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
   *. Vent
   Atelectasis R base, will increase PEEP today. Gas shows improved pH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multi-organ system failure and seizures. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a protected airway. He has multiple lines, including an arterial line, multi-lumen central line, and dialysis catheter. The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and has a low glomerular filtration rate. He is also on vasopressors for hypotension, which may be multifactorial in etiology. The patient's liver function tests are elevated due to sepsis and possibly hepatic congestion. He has a history of systolic heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction and is being monitored for cardiac arrhythmias. The patient also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He is being managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient initially presented with symptoms consistent with listeriosis, leading to septic shock. It is important to continue aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics for a prolonged period.
2. Multi-organ system failure: The patient's condition has progressed to involve multiple organs, including the liver, kidneys, heart, and lungs."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of seizure and bacteremia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes allergies to nadolol, propranolol, and lidocaine Hcl/epinephrine. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics since admission, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), and ampicillin. The patient is receiving several infusions, including calcium gluconate (CRRT), norepinephrine, and potassium chloride (CRRT). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 109/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on FiO2 40%. The patient's physical examination reveals neck supple, regular S1 S2 heart sounds, clear lungs bilaterally, distended abdomen with soft bowel sounds, warm extremities, anasarca with bilateral upper and lower extremity edema, and a femoral hemodialysis line with ecchymosis and oozing around the entry site. The patient is unresponsive and not following commands, with toes downgoing bilaterally.

   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - attempt to wean propofol
   .
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   EEG showed persistent seizure activity.  MRI performed.  NO seizures
   currently
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - started Phenobarbital, switch to PO this AM, follow levels
   - discuss with neuro re: no LP for now
   - MRI performed, will follow up results
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (now w/ low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with
   cardiogenic than septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect
   this).
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency also a possibility. On levophed currently.  Ran even on
   CVVH, Levophed lower today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Cont to run CVVH even as levophed requirement appears lower
   .
   * r/o Ventilator acquired pneumonia
   Sputum without pathogen identified yet. Temp curve improving on
   antibiotics.  WBC stable
   - Continue zosyn x8d course (d1 = [**5-10**])
   - Will D/C vanco
   - Follow up pending cultures and CIS
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down and cont to do so
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding.  Fibrino is increasing currently
   - monitor fibrinogen periodically
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.  Stable
   - DIC labs daily
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and seizures. The patient's altered mental status persists without signs of improvement, which is likely multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy. He has had multiple seizures, which may be due to CNS listeria infection. The patient is currently on propofol, and phenobarbital will be switched to PO today. EEG showed persistent seizure activity, and an MRI was performed. The patient also has bacteremia and septic shock likely caused by listeriosis with meningitis. He has hypotension of unclear etiology, possibly due to sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function, adrenal insufficiency, or medications. The patient is on levophed and ran even on CVVH, levophed lower today. There is a possibility of ventilator acquired pneumonia, and sputum culture is pending. The patient has acute oliguric renal failure, possibly from ATN in the setting of hypotension. Other conditions include transaminitis with a history of cirrhosis, systolic heart failure with EF 15% from either recent or remote MI, DIC, tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia,"

 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - attempt to wean propofol
   .
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   EEG showed persistent seizure activity.
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - started phenobarbital
   - discuss with neuro re: utility of repeat imaging vs. LP
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (now w/ low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with
   cardiogenic than septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect
   this).
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency also a possibility. On levophed currently
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Will change CVVH to run even to see if this improves hypotension
   .
   * r/o Ventilator acquired pneumonia
   Sputum without pathogen identified yet. Temp curve improving on
   antibiotics
   - Continue zosyn x8d course (d1 = [**5-10**])
   - Will D/C vanco
   - Follow up pending cultures and CIS
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will run even now to see if this improves
   hypotensiion
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue albumin 50mg [**Hospital1 **] per hepatology recommendations
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC). Check D bili today.
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding
   - monitor fibrinogen.
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.
   - DIC labs daily
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150

   MRI pending
   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and seizures.
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - attempt to wean propofol
   - lactulose
   - MRI today
   .
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   EEG showed persistent seizure activity.  NO seizures currently
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - started Phenobarbital, switch to PO this AM, follow levels next on
   [**5-16**]
   - discuss with neuro re: no LP for now
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (now w/ low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with
   cardiogenic than septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect
   this).
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency also a possibility. On levophed currently.  Ran even on
   CVVH, Levophed lower today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Cont to run CVVH even as levophed requirement appears lower
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down and cont to do so
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding.  Fibrino is increasing currently
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs daily
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.  Stable
   - DIC labs daily

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He is no longer seizing by EEG on both dilantin and phenobarbitol. His
   respiratory alkalosis is improved on current settings. He has begun to
yawn
, cough and be less tacypneic on the ventilator. Lfts and renal
   function are no worse. His CXR does show features of a RLL infiltrate
   although secretions are no worse.
   He will proceed to MRI today and we will then attempt transition to
   CPAP/ PSV later today if stable.
   Agree with plan to continue full supportive care and have low threshold
   for adding Antibiotics for VAP if febrile or with any signs of
   worsening hemodynamics. We will follow levels of AED in 24-48 hrs.
   Prognosis remains guarded.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is now experiencing multiorgan system failure and seizures. The patient has altered mental status, hypotension, oliguric renal failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a right lower lobe infiltrate seen on chest X-ray. The patient is critically ill and has a guarded prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
2. Multiorgan system failure.
3. Seizures due to CNS listeria infection.
4. Altered mental status due to multiple factors including CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Hypotension of unclear etiology, possibly due to sepsis, medications, volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), poor pump function, or adrenal insufficiency.
6. Oliguric renal failure likely from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension.
7. Transaminitis with history of cirrh"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, who has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of seizure. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide any history. 

The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions, including an MRI, which showed signs consistent with unchanged meningitis/cerebritis and small areas of possible septic infarcts. The patient has also been given additional phenobarb 10mg/kg and is being monitored for TTE due to the MRI findings. 

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/47 to 142/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,662 mL and output of 3,572 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,090 mL. The patient is receiving CRRT with calcium gluconate at 1.4 grams/hour and KCl at 2 mEq./hour. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, TCO2, and LDH, with decreased levels of Glucose. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient's assessment and plan include seizure with status epilepticus"

 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control
   seizures.
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   - f/u MRI final read -> discuss with neurology re: findings
   .
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   EEG showed persistent seizure activity.  Now without seizures currently
   on 2 agents.  Given MRI findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as
   nidus for seizure activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - Cont Phenobarbital.  Level at 21.7 and goal 20, would continue at
   current dose, follow levels next on [**5-16**]
   - discuss with neuro re: no LP for now
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than
   septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect this).
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency less likely. On levophed currently.  Ran even on CVVH,
   Levophed lower today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Cont to run CVVH even as levophed requirement appears lower overall
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding.  Fibrino is increasing currently
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.  Stable
   - DIC labs every other day

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's chief complaint is a seizure. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including meningitis/cerebritis, small areas of septic infarcts, myocardial infarction (heart attack), acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), hepatic encephalopathy, listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock, hypotension (low blood pressure), anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), diabetes mellitus, and cirrhosis of the liver.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
- Seizure: The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be due to CNS listeria infection. The patient is currently on two seizure medications and will continue to be monitored for seizure activity.
- Ineffective coping: The patient is unable to provide history due to sedation and encephalopathy.
- Meningitis: The patient is likely experiencing bacterial meningitis, and it is recommended to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) to confirm the diagnosis. However, given the patient's current condition, it may not be necessary at this time.
- Myocardial infarction (heart attack): The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, indicating systolic heart failure. The patient is currently on aspirin and beta-blockers.
- Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is"

 HYPERKALEMIA (HIGH POTASSIUM, HYPERPOTASSEMIA)
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   Assessment and Plan: 76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in
   septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem
   failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control
   seizures.
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   - f/u MRI final read -> discuss with neurology re: findings
   .
   *. Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess.
   EEG showed persistent seizure activity.  Now without seizures currently
   on 2 agents.  Given MRI findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as
   nidus for seizure activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - Cont Phenobarbital.  Level at 21.7 and goal 20, would continue at
   current dose, follow levels next on [**5-16**]
   - discuss with neuro re: no LP for now
   *. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   .
   * Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than
   septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect this).
   Multiple possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin),
   sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal
   insufficiency less likely. On levophed currently.  Ran even on CVVH,
   Levophed lower today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Cont to run CVVH even as levophed requirement appears lower overall
   .
   *. Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.
   DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment
   syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can tell from
   records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think less likely.
   Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   *. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so
   In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med
   toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious
   hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   *. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding.  Fibrino is increasing currently
   *. Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.  Stable
   - DIC labs every other day
   *. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
   *. Vent
   Atelectasis R base.  Put on PSV with increased PEEP [**5-14**], patient

   Assessment and Plan
   * Altered mental status: Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably
   multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Not interactive off of sedatives.
   - continue monitoring off sedation
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - lactulose for encephalopathy
   - f/u final MRI read --> septic emboli may be related to hematogenous
   Listeria spread but need to eval for endovascular sources --> check
   echo
   * Seizures.  Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria
   infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed
   persistent seizure activity.  NO seizures currently
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - started Phenobarbital, switch to PO this AM, follow levels next on
   [**5-16**]
   - discuss with neuro re: no LP for now
    *Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.  Likely c/b meningitis
   as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   * Hypotension-Unclear etiology although clinically seems most
   consistent w/ sepsis (now w/ low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more
   consistent with cardiogenic than septic etiology (although unclear if
   CVVH could affect this). Multiple possible contributors including meds
   (eg ativan, dilantin), sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump
   function. Adrenal insufficiency also a possibility. On levophed
   currently.  Ran even on CVVH, Levophed lower today.  Likely
   multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Cont to run CVVH even as levophed requirement appears lower
   *Acute oliguric renal failure: Most likely from ATN in the setting of
   hypotension.  Not fluid responsive.  DDx includes ATN in setting of
   sepsis and recent vol depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given
   cirrhosis. Abdominal compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV
   contrast, from what I can tell from records. Could have AIN in the
   setting of abx but I think less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   *Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.  LFTS have been trending down
   and cont to do so In setting of sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx
   includes med toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute
   infectious hepatitis less likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs daily
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC- Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that
   he does not have any active bleeding.  Fibrino is increasing currently
   *Tachyarrhythmia.  Pt had runs of NSVT, maintained BP at the time.
   Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis, with multiorgan system failure and seizures. He is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV with an endotracheal tube, and his vital signs are stable. He has a history of cirrhosis and is known to have an EF of 15%, indicating systolic heart failure. The patient also has acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient's condition is critical, and there is a risk of further complications related to the listeria infection, such as meningitis or endovascular spread.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial and requires close monitoring. It could be due to sepsis, medication effects, volume removal during CVVH, or poor pump function. Adrenal insufficiency is also a possibility.

3. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, most likely due to ATN. This may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.

4. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has experienced NSVT, which is concerning given his low EF and systemic infection. Continuous monitoring is necessary to prevent cardiac complications.

5. Anemia: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and seizures. The patient has been in the ICU and has received various treatments, including antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, and dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient has persistent altered mental status that is not improving, which could be due to CNS listerial infection, seizures, or hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be caused by CNS listeria infection. He is currently on antiepileptic drugs (dilantin and phenobarbital) and will continue to be monitored by neurology.
3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient is likely suffering from meningitis as presented with headache and lethargy. Blood cultures are pending, and he is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function, or adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed, and Levophed is being used to maintain adequate blood pressure.
5. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely due to ATN in the setting of hypot"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   - f/u MRI final read -> discuss with neurology re: findings
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - Cont Phenobarbital.  Level at 21.7 and goal 20, would continue at
   current dose, follow levels next on [**5-16**]
   - discuss with neuro re: no LP for now
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than
   septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect this). Multiple
   possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin), sepsis,
   volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal insufficiency
   less likely. On levophed currently.  Ran even on CVVH, Levophed lower
   today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Cont to run CVVH even as levophed requirement appears lower overall
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding.  Fibrino is increasing currently
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.  Stable
   - DIC labs every other day
   12. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Atelectasis R base.  Put on PSV with increased PEEP [**5-14**], patient
   tolerating well.  ABG has been stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, seizures, listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock, hypotension, acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status - The patient's altered mental status persists without signs of improvement, likely due to CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy. Continuous monitoring and neurological input are required.
2. Seizures - The patient has had multiple seizures, possibly due to CNS listeria infection. EEG showed persistent seizure activity. He is currently on two seizure medications, and neurology recommendations are appreciated. The patient's dilantin levels will be checked regularly due to artificially elevated albumin levels.
3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock - The patient likely has meningitis as well. Blood cultures are pending, and re-culture is recommended if febrile. TMP-SMX has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   - f/u MRI final read -> discuss with neurology re: findings
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - Cont Phenobarbital.  Level at 21.7 and goal 20, would continue at
   current dose, follow levels next on [**5-16**]
   - discuss with neuro re: no LP for now
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than
   septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect this). Multiple
   possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin), sepsis,
   volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal insufficiency
   less likely. On levophed currently.  Ran even on CVVH, Levophed lower
   today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Cont to run CVVH even as levophed requirement appears lower overall
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding.  Fibrino is increasing currently
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.  Stable
   - DIC labs every other day
   12. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Atelectasis R base.  Put on PSV with increased PEEP [**5-14**], patient
   tolerating well.  ABG has been stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis. He presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis, and now has multiorgan system failure with presumed meningitis/cerebritis and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, seizures, listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock, hypotension, acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis with history of cirrhosis, systolic heart failure with ejection fraction of 15%, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered and not interactive, which may be due to CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy. Continuous monitoring and neurology input are recommended.
2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be caused by CNS listeria infection. The patient is currently on two antiepileptic drugs, and neurology recommendations are appreciated.
3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient is likely experiencing meningitis as presented with headache and lethargy. Blood cultures are pending, and antibiotics have been started for synergy. A lumbar puncture may be considered if there"

   [**5-15**] CXR
   The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip is in the
   stomach.
   The right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
   Interval
   insertion of the double-lumen catheter also through the right internal
   jugular
   line tip also terminates at the same level. Cardiomediastinal
   silhouette is
   stable. Lungs are essentially clear with improvement of bibasilar
   atelectasis, currently mild.
   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   - f/u MRI final read -> discuss with neurology re: findings
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - Cont Phenobarbital.  Level at 21.7 and goal 20, would continue at
   current dose, follow levels next on [**5-16**]
   - discuss with neuro re: no LP for now
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here pending w/ NGTD
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than
   septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect this). Multiple
   possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin), sepsis,
   volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal insufficiency
   less likely. On levophed currently.  Ran even on CVVH, Levophed lower
   today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Cont to run CVVH even as levophed requirement appears lower overall
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, BB
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC
   Fibrinogen continues to be low but will not give cryo given that he
   does not have any active bleeding.  Fibrino is increasing currently
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC.  Stable
   - DIC labs every other day
   12. DM
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Atelectasis R base.  Put on PSV with increased PEEP [**5-14**], patient
   tolerating well.  ABG has been stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and is presumed to have meningitis/cerebritis. 

The patient's current medical conditions include altered mental status, seizures, listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock, hypotension, acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's mental status, ongoing seizures, progression of listeriosis and associated infections, continued hypotension and the need for vasopressor support, further deterioration of renal function, worsening liver function, cardiac dysfunction, progression of DIC, development of new arrhythmias, worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia, and management of diabetes mellitus in the ICU setting.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, neurologic status, seizure activity, infection parameters, renal function, liver function, cardiac function, coagulation profile, blood counts, and glucose levels. Additionally, the patient requires ongoing respiratory support, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodial"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a chief complaint of Listeriosis affecting his central nervous system (cerebritis/meningitis), bacteremia, and multiorgan failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and requires intensive care support.

The patient's medical history includes chronic liver disease, systolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and respiratory failure. He is also experiencing acute renal failure, persistent hypotension, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/48 to 120/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 458 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. His respiratory support is stable, and he has a respiratory rate similar to the set ventilator rate.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 131 to 156 mg/dL, hyponatremia with sodium levels ranging from 122 to 135 mEq/L, hypokalemia with potassium levels ranging from 3.2 to 4.1 mEq/L, and acute kidney injury with creatinine levels ranging from 1.6 to 2.1 mg/dL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics for Listeria infection (ampicillin and TMP-SMX), sedation hold, antiepileptic drugs (Dilantin and phenobarbital), lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, and cardiovascular support with levophed and norepinephrine. He is also receiving nutritional support with Renal (Full) formula at 35 mL/hour.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing new infections due to his immunocompromised state and invasive lines and catheters.
2. Septic shock: Given the presence of bacteremia and hypotension, the patient may be at risk of septic shock, especially if the source of infection is not controlled promptly.
3. Multiorgan failure: The patient already has multiorgan involvement, including liver, kidney, heart, and respiratory systems. There is a risk of further deterioration in organ function.
4. Bleeding: With the history of DIC, there is a risk of bleeding complications, especially if the patient's coagulation profile worsens.
5. Respiratory failure: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists w/o signs of improvement, probably multifactorial with CNS
   listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy.  Not interactive
   off of sedatives.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   - f/u MRI final read -> discuss with neurology re: findings ->
   recommend TTE
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - Cont Phenobarbital.  Level at 21.7 and goal 20, would continue at
   current dose, follow levels next on [**5-16**] -> 16
   - discuss with neuro
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than
   septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect this). Multiple
   possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin), sepsis,
   volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal insufficiency
   less likely. On levophed currently.  Ran even on CVVH, Levophed lower
   today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Cont to run CVVH even as levophed requirement appears lower overall
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Atelectasis R base.  Put on PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient
   tolerating well.  ABG has been stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is now in the ICU with multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains intubated and sedated. His blood cultures show no growth, and he has been treated with ampicillin and Bactrim for listeriosis. He also has acute oliguric renal failure, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, transaminitis, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered mental status: The patient has persistent altered mental status, which is likely multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy. Neurology input is appreciated, and the patient should be treated for seizures, maintained off propofol, given lactulose, and have a follow-up MRI.

2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT head without mass or abscess and EEG showed persistent seizure activity. The patient is currently on two seizure medications, and the neurology team's recommendations are appreciated. Dosing of phenobarbital should be adjusted based on the artificially elevated albumin levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but unclear if this is purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Not interactive off of sedatives.  MRI showing
   persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic
   infarct
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   - f/u MRI final read -> discuss with neurology re: findings ->
   recommend TTE
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - Cont Phenobarbital.  Level at 21.7 and goal 20, would continue at
   current dose, follow levels next on [**5-16**] -> 16
   - discuss with neuro
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than
   septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect this). Multiple
   possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin), sepsis,
   volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal insufficiency
   less likely. On levophed currently.  Ran even on CVVH, Levophed lower
   today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   - will try to run negative today
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Atelectasis R base.  Put on PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient
   tolerating well.  ABG has been stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multi-organ system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's altered mental status persists, possibly due to CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy, or a combination of these factors. The MRI showed persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis and areas of possible septic infarct. The patient is being treated with multiple medications for various conditions, including seizures, sepsis, hypotension, renal failure, and more.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy, or a combination of these factors. It is important to monitor the patient's neurological status and provide appropriate treatment.

2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be caused by CNS listeria infection. Seizure management involves treating with antiepileptic drugs and following up with neurology regarding MRI findings and dosing adjustments.

3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient likely has listeriosis, which has led to bacteremia and septic shock. Blood cultures have been taken, and appropriate antibiotics are being administered. ID recommendations"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of listeriosis and cerebritis/meningitis, leading to respiratory failure and multiorgan failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving treatment for both conditions. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis), and norepinephrine infusion for hypotension. He is also receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (ampicillin and TMP-SMX), anticonvulsants (phenobarbital and Dilantin), and supportive care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. OBTUNDATION: The patient has been diagnosed with listeria cerebritis and refractory seizures, and is being treated for both. There is a need for repeat MRI to further evaluate the possibility of septic emboli. The patient will continue to be monitored for any changes in mental status.
2. LISTERIOSIS: The patient has an ongoing infection with Listeria, for which he is receiving ampicillin and TMP-SMX. A prolonged course of antibiotics is anticipated.
3. PERSISTENT HYPOTENSION: The patient continues to experience hypotension, which may be related to cardiac dysfunction, medications, and CVVH. Supportive measures such as norepinephrine infusion and careful monitoring are ongoing.
4. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: The patient has acute renal failure, with differential diagnoses including"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but unclear if this is purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Not interactive off of sedatives.  MRI showing
   persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic
   infarct
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - Cont Phenobarbital.  Level 16
   - discuss with neuro
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than
   septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect this). Multiple
   possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin), sepsis,
   volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal insufficiency
   less likely. On levophed currently.  Ran even on CVVH, Levophed lower
   today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   - will try to run negative today
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Atelectasis R base.  Put on PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient
   tolerating well.  ABG has been stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and is presumed to have meningitis/cerebritis. The patient's altered mental status persists, with some eye opening but unclear if purposeful. He has a history of seizures, which may be due to CNS listeria infection. The patient is currently on two seizure medications and has an elevated level of phenobarbital.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, possibly due to CNS listeria infection. MRI findings show persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct.
3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient likely has listeriosis, which may lead to meningitis. Blood cultures are negative, and the patient is being treated with ampicillin and TMP-SMX for a 6-week course.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to various factors such as sepsis, medications, volume removal with CVVH, or poor pump function. Adrenal insufficiency is less likely.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Concern that he may be having persistent intermittent
   seizures. Some eye opening now but unclear if this is purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Not interactive off of sedatives.  MRI showing
   persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic
   infarct
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   - ECHO to eval for source of septic emboli
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - Cont Phenobarbital.  Level 16
   - discuss with neuro
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than
   septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect this). Multiple
   possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin), sepsis,
   volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal insufficiency
   less likely. On levophed currently.  Ran even on CVVH, Levophed lower
   today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   - will try to run negative today
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - d/c lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Now has been vented for almost 2 weeks.  Atelectasis R base.  Put on
   PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient tolerating well.  ABG has been
   stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis. He presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis, and now has multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis. The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient has persistent altered mental status, which may be due to CNS listeria infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy, or a combination of these factors. Neurology input is appreciated, and the patient should be maintained off propofol. Lactulose should be used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, and an ECHO should be done to evaluate for a source of septic emboli.

2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, possibly caused by CNS listeria infection. The EEG showed persistent seizure activity, and the patient is currently on two antiepileptic drugs. Dosing of the medications will need to be adjusted considering the artificially elevated albumin levels. Controlling phenobarbital levels are at 16, and discussing with neurology is recommended.

3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: This is likely causing meningitis as indicated by the patient's headache and lethargy. Blood cultures have been taken, but no growth has been observed so far. Reculture if febrile, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   OBTUNDATION-Listeria cerebritis and refractory seizures, now on tx for
   both. Concerning that hemay have had another seizure (initial event was
   [**5-3**]).  Cerebrititis/meningitis now complicated by likely septic
   emboli.  Overall prognosis would seem to be poor at this point.
   -Repeat MRI [**5-15**] suggesting poss septic emboli. Will f/u TTE today for
   veg.
   -continue holding sedation
   -neuro following --> Dilantin and phenobarb
   -stop lactulose
   -Listeria mgmt as below
   LISTERIOSIS
   -Ampicillin    (day 1 = [**5-4**])    and Bactrim   (day 1 = [**5-10**])
   -Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probable 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   PERSISTENT HYPOTENSION
   -may be related to poss cardiogenic component + meds + CVVH
   -cont Levophed support, daily weaning assessment
   -close monitoring for signs of pump failure or impending infection
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   - DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis.
   - CVVH for now, per Renal will run negative today w/ increased pressor
   support if needed
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE
   -stable, shock liver picture resolving
   -lactulose as above
   SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE
   -EF 15% on recent echo, runs of NSVT on telemetry
   -continue ASA
   - follow repeat TTE today.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   -stable on minimal vent settings, continueing to support pending
   additional fluid removal with cvvh
   -cont supportive ventilation pending full Neuro evaluation
   -  will need to think about tracheostomy if this is consistent with the
   overall goals of care.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Listeriosis: The patient is being treated for listeriosis, which is caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. This infection can cause meningitis and septic emboli, leading to poor prognosis.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, which may be related to cardiogenic component, medications, and CVVH. Close monitoring for signs of pump failure or impending infection is necessary.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, with possible causes including ATN in the setting of sepsis and recent volume depletion from diarrhea. CVVH is being used for now, and the renal team will run negative today with increased pressor support if needed.

4. Chronic liver disease: The patient has chronic liver disease, which is stable and showing a shock liver picture resolving. Lactulose is being given as above.

5. Systolic heart failure: The patient has systolic heart failure with an EF of 15% on recent echo, along with runs of NSVT on telemetry. ASA is being continued, and a repeat TTE is planned today.

6. Respiratory failure: The patient is stable on minimal vent settings and is continuing to receive supportive ventilation pending additional fluid removal with CVVH. A tracheostomy may need to be considered if this is consistent with the"

   PERSISTENT HYPOTENSION
   -may be related to poss cardiogenic component + meds + CVVH
   -cont Levophed support, daily weaning assessment
   -close monitoring for signs of pump failure or impending infection
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   - DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis.
   - CVVH for now, per Renal will run negative today w/ increased pressor
   support if needed
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE
   -stable, shock liver picture resolving
   -lactulose as above
   SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE
   -EF 15% on recent echo, runs of NSVT on telemetry
   -continue ASA
   - follow repeat TTE today.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   -stable on minimal vent settings, continueing to support pending
   additional fluid removal with cvvh
   -cont supportive ventilation pending full Neuro evaluation
   -  will need to think about tracheostomy if this is consistent with the
   overall goals of care.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of chronic liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and systolic heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with Listeria cerebritis and refractory seizures, and his prognosis is poor. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Persistent hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, which may be related to cardiac dysfunction, medications, and CVVH. Close monitoring and adjustment of Levophed support are necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and CVVH is being used to manage acute renal failure. Daily renal input is needed to assess and adjust treatment accordingly.

3. Chronic liver disease: Although the patient's liver function is stable and resolving, ongoing management with lactulose is required to prevent complications associated with hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Systolic heart failure: The patient has a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF 15%), indicating systolic heart failure. ASA is continued, and a repeat TTE is planned for further evaluation.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient remains dependent on ventilatory support and will need to be evaluated for tracheostomy placement if long-term ventilation is anticipated.

6. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): Although DIC has resolved, coagulation status should be monitored"

   both. Concerning that he may have had another seizure (initial event
   was [**5-3**]).  Cerebrititis/meningitis now complicated by likely septic
   emboli.  Overall prognosis would seem to be poor at this point.
   -Repeat MRI [**5-15**] suggesting poss septic emboli. Will f/u TTE today for
   veg.
   -continue holding sedation

   -stop lactulose
   -Listeria mgmt as below
   LISTERIOSIS
   -Ampicillin    (day 1 = [**5-4**])    and Bactrim   (day 1 = [**5-10**])
   -Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probable 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   PERSISTENT HYPOTENSION
   -may be related to poss cardiogenic component + meds + CVVH
   -cont Levophed support, daily weaning assessment
   -close monitoring for signs of pump failure or impending infection
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   - DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis.
   - CVVH for now, per Renal will run negative today w/ increased pressor
   support if needed
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE
   -stable, shock liver picture resolving
   -lactulose as above
   SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE
   -EF 15% on recent echo, runs of NSVT on telemetry
   -continue ASA
   - follow repeat TTE today.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   -stable on minimal vent settings, continuing to support pending
   additional fluid removal with cvvh
   -cont supportive ventilation pending full Neuro evaluation
   -  will need to think about tracheostomy if this is consistent with the
   overall goals of care.
   DIC- resolved, fibrinogen normal
   - check coags today
   DM- Hold home metformin, Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have a history of liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and an unknown primary malignancy. The patient is currently experiencing septic emboli, refractory seizures, persistent hypotension, acute renal failure, chronic liver disease, systolic heart failure, respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is being treated with various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, sedation hold, antiepileptic drugs, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), and supportive ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Listeriosis: The patient has been diagnosed with listeriosis, which is a bacterial infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes. This can be a serious condition, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems. Complications may include meningitis, sepsis, and neurological symptoms.
2. Septic Emboli: The patient has septic emboli, which refers to small blood clots that have formed in the bloodstream due to an infection. These clots can travel to different organs and cause further complications such as stroke, pulmonary embolism, or organ failure.
3. Refractory Seizures: The patient is experiencing refractory seizures, which means that the seizures are not responding to standard antiepileptic medications. This can lead to ongoing neurological damage and increased risk of complications.
4. Persistent Hypotension:"

   Assessment and Plan:
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Concern that he may be having persistent intermittent
   seizures. Some eye opening now but unclear if this is purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Not interactive off of sedatives.  MRI showing
   persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic
   infarct
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   - ECHO to eval for source of septic emboli
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - Cont Phenobarbital.  Level 16
   - discuss with neuro
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than
   septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect this). Multiple
   possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin), sepsis,
   volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal insufficiency
   less likely. On levophed currently.  Ran even on CVVH, Levophed lower
   today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   - will try to run negative today
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - d/c lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Now has been vented for almost 2 weeks.  Atelectasis R base.  Put on
   PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient tolerating well.  ABG has been
   stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis. He presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis, and is now in the ICU with multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and his condition has been complicated by seizures, hypotension, acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and poorly controlled diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status remains altered, likely due to a combination of CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy. Neurology input is appreciated, and treatment for seizures should be continued.
2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, possibly due to CNS listeria infection. An EEG showed persistent seizure activity, and the patient is currently on two antiepileptic drugs. Further discussion with neurology regarding dosing is needed, especially considering the artificially elevated albumin levels.
3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient likely has meningitis as well. Blood cultures have not grown any organisms so far, and follow"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's altered mental status persists, which is multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy. An MRI shows persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis and areas of possible septic infarct. The patient's current conditions include listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock, hypotension, acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, DIC (now resolved), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent intermittent seizures due to CNS listerial infection.
2. Persistent altered mental status due to multiple factors including CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Development of further complications from multiorgan system failure.
4. Potential relapse of listeriosis or secondary infections.
5. Progression of renal failure and need for continued renal support.
6. Complications related to cirrhosis, such as hepatorenal syndrome or abdominal compartment syndrome.
7. Cardiac complications from systolic heart failure and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with altered mental status, currently intubated and sedated. They have a history of ineffective coping, bacterial meningitis, acute myocardial infarction, severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and multiple comorbidities. The patient is receiving various treatments including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of bacterial meningitis and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of developing further infections due to the invasive procedures and compromised immune system.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has had an acute myocardial infarction, and there may be ongoing cardiac dysfunction. Monitoring and management of cardiac function should be prioritized.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory distress. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and adjusting ventilator settings accordingly is essential.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a need for ongoing renal support and monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction may contribute to altered mental status and other complications. Monitoring liver function and managing hepatic encephalopathy symptoms is crucial.
6. Sepsis: The patient has a history of severe"

   Assessment and Plan:
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Concern that he may be having persistent intermittent
   seizures. Some eye opening now but unclear if this is purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Not interactive off of sedatives.  MRI showing
   persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic
   infarct
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   - ECHO to eval for source of septic emboli
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin, checking regular and free dilantin levels and will
   f/u w/ neurology re dosing given artificially elevated albumin
   - Cont Phenobarbital.  Level 16
   - discuss with neuro
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Unclear etiology although clinically seems most consistent w/ sepsis
   (low-grade fevers on CVVH).  Mvo2 more consistent with cardiogenic than
   septic etiology (although unclear if CVVH could affect this). Multiple
   possible contributors including meds (eg ativan, dilantin), sepsis,
   volume removal with CVVH, poor pump function. Adrenal insufficiency
   less likely. On levophed currently.  Ran even on CVVH, Levophed lower
   today.  Likely multifactorial
   - Cortisol level not drastically low
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Continue levophed target MAP>60 -> attempt to wean to off
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   - will try to run negative today
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - d/c lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Now has been vented for almost 2 weeks.  Atelectasis R base.  Put on
   PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient tolerating well.  ABG has been
   stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis. He presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis, and is now experiencing multiorgan system failure with presumed meningitis/cerebritis and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, ongoing seizures, listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock, hypotension, acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis with history of cirrhosis, systolic heart failure with ejection fraction of 15%, resolved disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Persistent seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be due to CNS listeria infection. It is important to continue treating seizures and monitoring for any further seizure activity.

2. Organ failure: The patient is experiencing multiorgan system failure, including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring and appropriate management of these organ systems will be necessary.

3. Infection control: The patient is likely suffering from listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock. Proper infection control measures should be taken, including administration of appropriate antibiotics and monitoring for any signs of infection.

4. Hypotension: The patient's"

   PERSISTENT HYPOTENSION
   -may be related to poss cardiogenic component + meds + CVVH
   -cont Levophed support, daily weaning assessment
   -close monitoring for signs of pump failure or impending infection
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
    - DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis.
     -CVVH for now, per Renal will run negative today w/ increased pressor
   support if needed
    - Appreciate continued renal input
   CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE
   -stable, shock liver picture resolving

    -EF 15% on recent echo, runs of NSVT on telemetry
   -continue ASA
   - follow repeat TTE today.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
    -stable on minimal vent settings, continuing to support pending
   additional fluid removal with cvvh
   -cont supportive ventilation pending full Neuro evaluation
   -  will need to think about tracheostomy if this is consistent with the
   overall goals of care.
   DIC- resolved, fibrinogen normal
   - check coags today

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have been diagnosed with Listeriosis, which requires a prolonged course of antibiotics. The patient also suffers from persistent hypotension, possibly due to a combination of cardiogenic factors, medications, and CVVH. Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, with differential diagnoses including ATN, HRS, and consideration for CVVH. Chronic liver disease is stable and resolving, while the patient also exhibits systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%. The patient's respiratory status is stable on minimal vent settings, but further evaluation is needed before considering tracheostomy. DIC has resolved, and diabetes management involves holding home metformin and using insulin sliding scale. The patient is receiving renal nutrition and requires close monitoring for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic emboli: The patient's cerebritis/meningitis has complicated into likely septic emboli, which can lead to further infections and complications in various organs.
2. Refractory seizures: The patient is being treated for both listeriosis and seizures, indicating a risk of ongoing seizure activity.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's persistent hypotension may be related to cardiogenic factors, potentially leading to shock and compromised organ perfusion.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, requiring CVVH and posing a risk of further kidney damage.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU. They have a history of chronic liver disease, acute renal failure, and systolic heart failure. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications. 

Key points from the progress note include:

- The patient has been treated for listeriosis with ampicillin and Bactrim.
- Persistent hypotension is being managed with Levophed support, and efforts are being made to run even today.
- Acute renal failure is suspected to be due to sepsis and recent volume depletion from diarrhea. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being used for now, and renal input is appreciated.
- Chronic liver disease is stable, showing a resolving shock liver picture.
- Systolic heart failure has improved with an ejection fraction of 55% from 15%.
- Respiratory failure is stable on minimal vent settings, and supportive ventilation will continue. A tracheostomy may be considered if this is consistent with the overall goals of care.
- DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) has resolved, and coagulation will be checked today.
- Diabetes management involves holding home metformin, using insulin sliding scale, and maintaining a goal glucose level below 150.

   > OBTUNDATION-  Listeria cerebritis and refractory seizures, now on tx
   for both. Seizures appear to be well controlled on phenobarb and
   dilantin.  Cerebrititis/meningitis now complicated by likely septic
   emboli.  No evidence of veg on TTE
   -continue holding sedation
   -neuro following --> Dilantin and phenobarb. ? can we lighten the
   anti-convulsant regimen specifically the phenobarb
   -Listeria mgmt as below
    >LISTERIOSIS
   -Ampicillin    (day 1 = [**5-4**])    and Bactrim   (day 1 = [**5-10**])
   -Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probable 3 week course of TMP-SMX
    >PERSISTENT HYPOTENSION
    -may be related to  meds + CVVH. Will try to run even today
    -cont Levophed support,
   - notably TTE shows improved LV function
    >ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
    - DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis.
    -CVVH for now, per Renal will run negative today w/ increased pressor
   support if needed
    - Appreciate continued renal input
    >CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE
   -stable, shock liver picture resolving
   >SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE
   -EF improved to 55% from 15%
   -continue ASA
    >RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   -stable on minimal vent settings, continuing to support pending
   additional fluid removal with cvvh
   -cont supportive ventilation
   -  will need to think about tracheostomy if this is consistent with the
   overall goals of care.
   >DIC- resolved, fibrinogen normal
   - check coags today
   >DM- Hold home metformin, Insulin sliding scale, goal glucose <150

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Based on the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Listeriosis: The patient has been diagnosed with listeriosis, and treatment includes antibiotics such as ampicillin and Bactrim. It is anticipated to have a 6-week course of ampicillin and a probable 3-week course of TMP-SMX.

2. Persistent Hypotension: The patient continues to have persistent hypotension, which may be related to medications and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration). Levophed support will be continued, especially with improved LV (left ventricular) function seen on TTE (transthoracic echo).

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which could be due to ATN (acute tubular necrosis) in the setting of sepsis and recent volume depletion from diarrhea. CVVH will be continued for now, and the renal team will run negative today with increased pressor support if needed.

4. Chronic Liver Disease: The patient has chronic liver disease, which is stable and showing a shock liver picture resolving.

5. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has systolic heart failure, with an EF (ejection fraction) improved to 55% from 15%. ASA (aspirin) will be continued.

6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is stable on minimal vent settings,"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Concern that he may be having persistent intermittent
   seizures. Some eye opening now but unclear if this is purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Not interactive off of sedatives.  MRI showing
   persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic
   infarct. TTE without evidence of vegetations.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and phenobarbital ?possibility of weaning down, will
   discuss with neurology
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Will attempt to run even today with goal of weaning down pressor
   requirement, but still need to strive for adequate MAP>60  for CNS
   perfusion
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. Nl pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - d/c lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Now has been vented for almost 2 weeks.  Atelectasis R base.  Put on
   PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient tolerating well.  ABG has been
   stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Concern that he may be having persistent intermittent
   seizures. Some eye opening now but does not appear  purposful. probably
   multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Not interactive off of sedatives, now 6 days without
   sedation.  MRI showing persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and
   areas of possible septic infarct. TTE without evidence of vegetations.
   ? whether phenobarbitol contributing to poor MS and began to wean
   yesterday.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and Phenobarbital, weaning down
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH (day 1=[**5-6**]). Added TMP-SMX for
   synergy. Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of
   TMP-SMX (day 1=[**5-10**])
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Will attempt to run even today with goal of weaning down pressor
   requirement, but still need to strive for adequate MAP>60  for CNS
   perfusion
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. Nl pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - d/c lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Now has been vented for almost 2 weeks.  Atelectasis R base.  Put on
   PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient tolerating well.  ABG has been
   stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis. He presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis, and now has multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis. He has been difficult to control seizures and is currently on two antiepileptic medications. The patient's altered mental status persists, possibly due to CNS listerial infection, seizures, and hepatic encephalopathy. Imaging studies show persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis and areas of possible septic infarct. The patient's condition remains unstable with several medical complications including hypotension, acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, antiepileptic drugs, and other supportive care medications. The patient's prognosis remains guarded."

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear  purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, meds.  Not interactive off of sedatives, now 6 days
   without sedation.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct. TTE
   without evidence of vegetations.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - weaning phenobarb per neuro recs, continuing dilantin
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose off
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and Phenobarbital, weaning down
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH (day 1=[**5-4**]). Added TMP-SMX for
   synergy. Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of
   TMP-SMX (day 1=[**5-10**])
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Will attempt to run even today with goal of weaning down pressor
   requirement, but still need to strive for adequate MAP>60  for CNS
   perfusion
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. Nl pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - Check sputum. Pan culture, with underlying liver dz, CVVH s/sx of new
   infection may be subtle.
   - Repeat AM cortisol
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Repeat LFTs today
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - d/c lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   - Repeat coags on [**5-21**]
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150. Will add NPH
    13. Vent
   Now has been vented for almost 2 weeks.  Atelectasis R base.  Put on
   PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient tolerating well.  ABG has been
   stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now
   - Arrange for trach/PEG per family wishes

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. 

1. Altered mental status persists, possibly due to CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy, and medications. An MRI showed persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis and areas of possible septic infarct. The patient is currently on two seizure medications and weaning off phenobarbital.
2. Seizures are ongoing and may be due to CNS listeria infection. The patient is currently on two seizure medications, but the MRI findings are unclear about whether septic infarcts are serving as a nidus for seizure activity.
3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock is suspected, likely causing meningitis. Blood cultures are negative, but there will be reculture if febrile, and follow-up pending microbiology sensitivities. A six-week course of ampicillin is recommended for CNS listeriosis.
4. Hypotension is multifactorial and includes sepsis, intravascular volume depletion, and medications. The goal is to wean down pressor requirements while maintaining adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 for CNS perfusion.
5. Acute oliguric renal failure is likely from acute tubular nec"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Concern that he may be having persistent intermittent
   seizures. Some eye opening now but unclear if this is purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Not interactive off of sedatives.  MRI showing
   persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic
   infarct. TTE without evidence of vegetations.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - treat seizures as below
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and phenobarbital ?possibility of weaning down, will
   discuss with neurology
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH. Added TMP-SMX for synergy.
   Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Will attempt to run even today with goal of weaning down pressor
   requirement, but still need to strive for adequate MAP>60  for CNS
   perfusion
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. Nl pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - Follow up cultures, CIS, infection tx as above
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, but will cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Continue to trends LFTs periodically
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - d/c lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry and continue metoprolol
   - Will keep pads on for now
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150
    13. Vent
   Now has been vented for almost 2 weeks.  Atelectasis R base.  Put on
   PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient tolerating well.  ABG has been
   stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now

   Assessment and Plan
   > OBTUNDATION-  Listeria cerebritis and refractory seizures, now on tx
   for both. Seizures appear to be well controlled on phenobarb and
   dilantin.  Cerebrititis/meningitis now complicated by likely septic
   emboli.  No evidence of veg on TTE.
   -continue holding sedation
   -neuro following --> Dilantin and phenobarb. We are now working on
   weaning off the phenobarb today and the qd on Friday
   -Listeria mgmt as below
    >LISTERIOSIS
   -Ampicillin    (day 1 = [**5-4**])    and Bactrim   (day 1 = [**5-10**])
   -Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probable 3 week course of TMP-SMX
    >PERSISTENT HYPOTENSION
   -may be related to  meds + CVVH. Cont to run even for the day and wean
   phenbarb
    -cont Levophed support,
   - notably TTE shows improved LV function
   - repeat clx for now (blood, sputum, c. diff)
   - repeat random cortisol
   - would not change the central lines unless pos clx or change in
   clinical status
     >ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
    - DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis.
    -CVVH for now
    - Appreciate continued renal input
    >CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE
   -stable, shock liver picture resolving
    >SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE
   -EF improved to 55% from 15%
   -continue ASA
    >RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   -stable on minimal vent settings, continuing to support pending
   additional fluid removal with cvvh
   - plan for PEG and trachesotomy
   - seems to be an increase in sputum, will check clx (no fevers although
   on CVVH) or change to WBC
    >DIC- resolved, fibrinogen normal
   - follow coags repeat [**5-21**]
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition:

1. The patient has been diagnosed with listeriosis and is being treated with ampicillin and Bactrim. The treatment plan includes a 6-week course of ampicillin and a probable 3-week course of TMP-SMX.

2. The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, which may be related to medications and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The plan is to continue Levophed support and wean off phenobarbital.

3. The patient is suffering from acute renal failure, with a differential diagnosis including acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis and recent volume depletion from diarrhea. CVVH is being used for now, and continued renal input is appreciated.

4. The patient has chronic liver disease, which is stable and showing signs of resolving shock liver picture. There is no immediate intervention required for the liver condition.

5. The patient is experiencing systolic heart failure, but there has been improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction from 15% to 55%. The patient is continuing to take aspirin (ASA).

6. The patient is stable on minimal ventilator settings, with ongoing support pending additional fluid removal through CVVH. The plan includes percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheost"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has a history of chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, and systolic heart failure. He presented with symptoms of sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient was started on antibiotics and vasopressor support. He developed acute renal failure and required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient also had a seizure and was diagnosed with Listeria cerebritis, for which he is being treated with ampicillin and cranial antibiotics. The patient's condition has improved, with stabilization of his respiratory and cardiovascular status. However, he continues to have persistent hypotension and requires ongoing vasopressor support. 

Potential Complications:
1. Sepsis-related complications: Given the patient's initial presentation with sepsis and ongoing infection, there is a risk of further complications such as septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or sepsis-induced coagulopathy.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI if there is ongoing renal hypoperfusion or if CRRT is not adequately managing his fluid and electrolyte balance.
3. Liver failure: Although the patient's liver function tests are stable, the underlying chronic liver disease puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy or decompensation if"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with listeriosis, which is being treated with ampicillin and Bactrim. The patient also has persistent hypotension, acute renal failure, chronic liver disease, systolic heart failure, and respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Seizures: The patient is on treatment for both listeriosis and seizures, indicating a risk of recurrent seizures.
2. Septic emboli: The patient's meningitis has complicated into septic emboli, which can lead to further systemic infections.
3. Weaning off ventilator support: The patient is being weaned off phenobarbital and plans to discontinue it on Friday. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) during this process.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires careful management, and there is a risk of further complications if not adequately controlled.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for acute renal failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function.
6. Chronic liver disease: Although the patient's liver function is stable, there is a risk of decompensation due to ongoing infections or other complications.
7. Systolic heart failure: The patient's systolic heart failure has improved, but there is still a risk of further cardiac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has a history of ineffective coping, bacterial meningitis, acute myocardial infarction, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and seizure with status epilepticus. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with an endotracheal tube in place. Vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105/51 to 119/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 30%. The patient has received various treatments including Norepinephrine infusion, heparin sodium prophylaxis, and has undergone several blood cultures, urine culture, and CVVH. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's condition requires ongoing ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, potential medical complications may include:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of bacterial meningitis and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of developing new infections due to prolonged hospitalization, invasive lines, and immunocompromised state.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction, and ongoing cardiac monitoring is necessary to detect any changes in cardiac function.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or further deterioration in respiratory function.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and ongoing monitoring of renal function is required. Dialysis may be necessary to support kidney function.
5. Seizure activity: The patient has a history of seizure with status epilepticus, and anticonvulsant therapy may be needed to prevent further seizures.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy, and careful monitoring of liver function and electrolyte balance is necessary to prevent further neurological decline.
7. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and ongoing surveillance for signs of sepsis and organ failure is essential.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and intervene promptly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear  purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, meds.  Not interactive off of sedatives, now 6 days
   without sedation.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct. TTE
   without evidence of vegetations.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - weaning phenobarb per neuro recs, continuing dilantin
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose off
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and Phenobarbital, weaning down
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH (day 1=[**5-4**]). Added TMP-SMX for
   synergy. Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of
   TMP-SMX (day 1=[**5-10**])
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Will attempt to run even today with goal of weaning down pressor
   requirement, but still need to strive for adequate MAP>60  for CNS
   perfusion
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. Nl pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - Check sputum. Pan culture, with underlying liver dz, CVVH s/sx of new
   infection may be subtle.
   - Repeat AM cortisol
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Repeat LFTs today
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - d/c lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   - Repeat coags on [**5-21**]
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150. Will add NPH
    13. Vent
   Now has been vented for almost 2 weeks.  Atelectasis R base.  Put on
   PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient tolerating well.  ABG has been
   stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now
   - Arrange for trach/PEG per family wishes

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient remains intubated and sedated, with altered mental status. He has multiple complications including hypotension, acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently receiving various treatments including antibiotics, CVVH, NPH, tracheostomy/PEG tube, and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy, or medications. It is important to closely monitor his neurological status and provide appropriate medical interventions as needed.
2. Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be related to CNS listeria infection or septic infarcts in the brain. Continuous seizure monitoring and management with antiepileptic drugs are necessary.
3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient likely has meningitis as evidenced by"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   1. Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear  purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, meds.  Not interactive off of sedatives, now 6 days
   without sedation.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct. TTE
   without evidence of vegetations.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - weaning phenobarb per neuro recs, continuing dilantin
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose off
   2. Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and Phenobarbital, weaning down
    3. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH (day 1=[**5-4**]). Added TMP-SMX for
   synergy. Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of
   TMP-SMX (day 1=[**5-10**])
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   4. Hypotension
   Will attempt to run even today with goal of weaning down pressor
   requirement, but still need to strive for adequate MAP>60  for CNS
   perfusion
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. Nl pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency.
   - Check sputum. Pan culture, with underlying liver dz, CVVH s/sx of new
   infection may be subtle.
   - Repeat AM cortisol
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - surveillance blood cx
   5. Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - CVVH for now, cont to run even
   - Appreciate continued renal input
   - Replaced femoral HD line for IJ HD line on [**5-14**]
   6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Repeat LFTs today
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - d/c lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   7. Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   8. DIC: now resolved
   - Repeat coags on [**5-21**]
   9. Tachyarrhythmia.
   Pt had runsNSVT, maintained BP at the time. Likely predisposed with low
   EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in setting of renal
   failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   10. Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   11. Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   12. DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150. Will add NPH
    13. Vent
   Now has been vented for almost 2 weeks.  Atelectasis R base.  Put on
   PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient tolerating well.  ABG has been
   stable
   - Cont PSV ventilation with high PEEP for now
   - Arrange for trach/PEG per family wishes

","The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Altered mental status: The patient is not responsive to voice or noxious stimuli and has been without sedation for 6 days. MRI findings show signs of meningitis/cerebritis and possible septic infarct.
- Seizures: The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be due to CNS listeria infection. EEG showed persistent seizure activity.
- Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient likely has meningitis as presented with HA and lethargy.
- Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely multifactorial and may include medications, sepsis, and intravascular volume depletion.
- Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient's renal failure is most likely due to ATN in the setting of hypotension.
- Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes are likely from shock liver or medication toxicity.
- Systolic heart failure with EF 15%: The patient has a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, likely from recent or remote myocardial infarction.
- DIC: The patient had disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is now resolved.
- Tachyarrhythmia: The patient had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and is at risk for further arrhythmias.
- Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia, possibly due to IV fluid administration.
- Thrombocytopenia: The patient had initially low platelet count, which is now stable.
- DM: The patient's blood sugar is well-controlled.
- Ventilation: The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated for almost 2 weeks.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Further deterioration of mental status.
2. Recurrence of seizures.
3. Development of new infections.
4. Persistent hypotension leading to organ perfusion issues.
5. Progression of renal failure.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Bleeding complications due to previous DIC.
9. Poor glycemic control.
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear  purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, meds.  Not interactive off of sedatives, now 6 days
   without sedation.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct. TTE
   without evidence of vegetations.
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - weaning phenobarb per neuro recs, continuing dilantin
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose off
   - Repeat MRI early in week of [**5-24**]
   * Seizures.
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Now without seizures currently on 2 agents.  Given MRI
   findings, unclear if septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure
   activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and Phenobarbital, weaning down
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH (day 1=[**5-4**]). Added TMP-SMX for
   synergy. Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of
   TMP-SMX (day 1=[**5-10**]). Discuss TMPSMX dosing for HD w pharmacy.
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   * Hypotension, low grade temps
   Now off of CVVH, changing to intermittent HD per renal recs.
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. Nl pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency (random [**Last Name (un) **] 20 [**5-20**])
   - f/u pending cultures, CIS
   - keep in lines for now
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   * Low grade temps
   Might have been masked by CVVH previously
   - f/u pending cultures and CIS
   - add on amylase/lipase
   - check RUQ u/s eval for acalculous cholecystitis
   * Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - HD per renal recs, had been on CVVH
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Following LFTs
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - d/c lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC: now resolved
   - Follow INR
   * Tachyarrhythmia.
   Resolved
   Pt had runs NSVT early in admission, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC [**Month/Year (2) **] every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   * DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH with TF
   off prior to trach/peg
    * Vent
   Now has been vented for almost 2 weeks.  Atelectasis R base.  Put on
   PSV with increased PEEP [**9-30**], patient tolerating well.  ABG has been
   stable
   Trach and PEG today

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. There is also a mention of possible meningitis/cerebritis based on the MRI findings. Additionally, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being intubated for almost two weeks.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute oliguric renal failure, which is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension. This can be further complicated by hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) given the patient's history of cirrhosis.

3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has transaminitis with a history of cirrhosis. This could be due to shock liver in the setting of sepsis or hepatic congestion. Monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is important in this case.

4. Cardiac Issues: The patient has systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%. This could be due to a recent or remote myocardial infarction. The patient is at risk for arrhythmias, particularly nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), given the low EF.

5. Thrombocytopenia and Anemia: The patient has thrombocytopen"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with multiple ongoing medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with listeriosis, meningitis, septic emboli, and refractory seizures. They are currently receiving treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics and anti-seizure medications. The patient's persistent hypotension may be related to medications and CVVH. They also have acute renal failure, chronic liver disease, systolic heart failure, respiratory failure, and DIC, which has resolved. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to the presence of multiple lines and tubes, as well as immunosuppression from listeriosis and meningitis.
2. Seizures: Despite being on anti-seizure medications, there is still a risk of seizures due to the ongoing cerebritis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension needs to be closely monitored and managed, potentially requiring adjustments in medication dosages or other interventions.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and further interventions may be necessary to support kidney function.
5. Chronic Liver Disease: Although the patient's liver function is currently stable, ongoing monitoring is required, and management of any complications related to liver disease should be considered.
6. Systolic Heart Failure: The improvement in the patient's left ventricular function is a positive"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Listeriosis: The patient has been diagnosed with listeriosis, which is a bacterial infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes. This infection can lead to meningitis and septic emboli. The patient is being treated with ampicillin and Bactrim.

2. Persistent Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension, which may be related to medications and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). The plan is to continue Levophed support and wean off phenobarbital.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is suspected to have acute renal failure, possibly due to sepsis and recent volume depletion from diarrhea. CVVH is being used for renal support, and continued renal input is appreciated.

4. Chronic Liver Disease: The patient has stable chronic liver disease, likely related to cirrhosis. The liver function is improving.

5. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has systolic heart failure with an improved ejection fraction from 15% to 55%. Aspirin (ASA) is being continued.

6. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains stable on minimal ventilator settings. Plans include supporting the patient pending additional fluid removal with CVVH and considering percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheostomy"

   Assessment and Plan
   > OBTUNDATION-  Listeria cerebritis and refractory seizures, now on tx
   for both. Seizures appear to be well controlled on phenobarb and
   dilantin and working on weaning phenobarb off.  Cerebrititis/meningitis
   now complicated by likely septic emboli.  No evidence of veg on TTE.
   There has been no evidence of improvement over the last several days
   -continue holding sedation
   -neuro following --> Dilantin and phenobarb. Phenobarb down to qd
   dosing today and last day is [**5-22**] then off.
   - repeat MRI early next week for prognosticating
   -Listeria mgmt as below
   >LISTERIOSIS
   -Ampicillin    (day 1 = [**5-4**])   and Bactrim   (day 1 = [**5-10**]) (Changed
   to PO yesterday)
   - change abx to HD dosing
   -Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probable 3 week course of TMP-SMX
   > Fevers: broad differential including line infection, ,  sinusitis,
   pancreatitis, cholecystitis
   - Clx pending
   - follow Alk Phos
   - RUQ U/S
   - check amylase,lipase
   - Could consider re-tapping the ascites, DVTs, sinusitis as additional
   causes.
     >PERSISTENT HYPOTENSION
   -may be related to  meds + CVVH. Cont to run even for the day and wean
   phenbarb as above
    -cont Levophed support,
   - notably TTE shows improved LV function
   - repeat clx for now (blood, sputum, c. diff)
   - repeat random cortisol  was 20.1 [**5-20**]
   - would not change the central lines unless pos clx or change in
   clinical status (follow up clx)
     >ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   - DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol depletion from
   diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis.
    -CVVH  on hold
    - Appreciate continued renal input
    >CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE
   -stable, shock liver picture resolving
   >SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE
   -EF improved to 55% from 15%
   -continue ASA
   >RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   -Increasing PS requirement likely [**1-25**] CVVH stopping (increasing acid
   load)
   - plan for PEG and trachesotomy today
   - will change to vol control for the day
   - seems to be an increase in sputum, will check clx (no fevers although
   on CVVH) or change to WBC
   >DIC- resolved, fibrinogen normal
   - follow coags repeat [**5-21**]
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with listeriosis, which has led to meningitis and refractory seizures. They are currently on treatment for both conditions and are showing good control of the seizures. The patient's cerebritis/meningitis has also been complicated by septic emboli, and there has been no evidence of improvement over the last several days.

The patient's persistent hypotension may be related to medications and CVVH. Levophed support is being continued, and TTE shows improved LV function. Repeat clx for now, including blood, sputum, and C. diff, and would not change the central lines unless positive clx or a change in clinical status.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, with a differential diagnosis including ATN in the setting of sepsis and recent volume depletion from diarrhea. Consideration should also be given to HRS given cirrhosis. CVVH has been put on hold, and continued renal input is appreciated.

Other ongoing assessments and plans include chronic liver disease (stable, shock liver picture resolving), systolic heart failure (EF improved to 55% from 15%), respiratory failure (increasing PS requirement likely [1-25] CVVH stopping), and DIC (resolved, fibrinogen normal). The remainder of the plan is outlined in the resident note.

ICU care includes tube feeds on hold"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear  purposful.
   probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, meds.  Not interactive off of sedatives, now 6 days
   without sedation.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct. TTE
   without evidence of vegetations.  Had been trying to ween down
   anticonvulsants due to concern these were contributing to sedation
   - Neurology input appreciated.
   - continue phenobarb, dilantin
   - maintain off propofol
   - lactulose off
   - Repeat MRI early in week of [**5-24**]
   * Seizures.
   Shaking yesterday afternoon seemed more consistent with rigoring than
   seizures, nevertheless must have low suspicion for seizure activity esp
   in setting of weaning anticonvulsants and recurrent seizures here
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Given MRI findings ? septic infarcts serving as nidus for
   seizure activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and Phenobarbital, will maintain current doses
   - Repeat EEG today
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH (day 1=[**5-4**]). Added TMP-SMX for
   synergy. Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of
   TMP-SMX (day 1=[**5-10**]). Discuss TMPSMX dosing for HD w pharmacy.
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   * Hypotension, low grade temps
   Now off of CVVH, changing to intermittent HD per renal recs.
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. Nl pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency (random [**Last Name (un) **] 20 [**5-20**])
   - f/u pending cultures, CIS
   - keep in lines for now
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   * Aspiration pna, suspected
   * Pancreatitis
   * Low grade temps
   Might have been masked by CVVH previously
   - f/u pending cultures and CIS
   - add on amylase/lipase
   - check RUQ u/s eval for acalculous cholecystitis
   * Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - HD per renal recs, had been on CVVH
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely.
   - Following LFTs
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Liver following. DC
d albumin
   - elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - d/c lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - continue ASA, no metop as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC: now resolved
   - Follow INR
   * Tachyarrhythmia.
   Resolved
   Pt had runs NSVT early in admission, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable
   - continue to trend
   * DM: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regualr sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH with TF
   off prior to trach/peg

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's altered mental status persists, possibly due to CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy, and medications. MRI findings show persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis and areas of possible septic infarct. The patient's seizures may be caused by CNS listeria infection, and EEG showed persistent seizure activity. He has low-grade temperatures, hypotension, and evidence of fluid overload. The patient also has acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis with a history of cirrhosis, systolic heart failure with an EF of 15%, resolved DIC, tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications:
1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
2. Meningitis.
3. Cerebritis.
4. Difficult-to-control seizures.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Acute oliguric renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Hypotension, low-grade temperatures, hypothermia
   Concern for aspiration event yesterday during contrast administration.
   Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear etiology
 question
   pancreatitis.
   Now off of CVVH, changing to intermittent HD per renal recs.
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. CNS dysfunction and thromboembolic disease also on
   the differential. Normal pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency (random [**Last Name (un) **] 20 [**5-20**]).
   - Broadened to meropenem yesterday, continue
   - Follow-up read of CT abdomen from yesterday
   - Obtain sputum culture today
   - Follow-up pending cultures, CIS
   - Keep in lines for now
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
 MAP goal 60
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Check LENIS
   - Will start midodrine post-dialysis in case of central dysfunction
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear  purposful.
   Probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, medications.  Not interactive off of sedatives, now 6
   days without sedation.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct. TTE
   without evidence of vegetations.  Had been trying to ween down
   anticonvulsants due to concern these were contributing to sedation
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - Repeat EEG
   - Continue phenobarbitol, dilantin for now pending EEG
   - Maintain off propofol
   - Lactulose off
   - Repeat MRI early in week of [**5-24**]
   * Seizures.
   Shaking yesterday afternoon seemed more consistent with rigoring than
   seizures, nevertheless must have low suspicion for seizure activity esp
   in setting of weaning anticonvulsants and recurrent seizures here
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Given MRI findings ? septic infarcts serving as nidus for
   seizure activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and Phenobarbital, will maintain current doses
   - Repeat EEG today
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH (day 1=[**5-4**]). Added TMP-SMX for
   synergy. Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of
   TMP-SMX (day 1=[**5-10**]). Discuss TMP-SMX dosing for HD w pharmacy.
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   * Aspiration pna, suspected.
   - On meropenem as above
   - Obtaining sputum culture
   - Monitor chest x-ray, clinic examination
   * Pancreatitis, suspected. Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear
   etiology.
   - Follow-up read of CT abdomen
   - Monitor enzymes
   * Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - HD per renal recs, had been on CVVH
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely. Status post albumin. Liver consult has signed off.
   - Following LFTs
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - D/C
d lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, no metoprolol as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC: now resolved
   - Follow INR
   * Tachyarrhythmia.
   Resolved
   Pt had runs NSVT early in admission, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable.
   - continue to trend
   * DM2: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regular sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH with TF
   off prior to trach/peg
   * Respiratory failure: In the setting of CNS disease and sepsis.
   - Status post trach yesterday

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a possible right basilar infiltrate on chest X-ray, which could indicate pneumonia.

2. Aspiration: The patient may have aspirated while receiving contrast via a peg tube, leading to a respiratory infection.

3. Seizure: The patient exhibited bilateral arm shaking, which was initially suspected as a recurrent seizure. Lorazepam was administered to control the seizure activity.

4. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status and possible aspiration pneumonia increase the risk of developing meningitis, especially considering the broad-spectrum antibiotics already being administered.

5. Myocardial infarction: The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, which could be indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).

6. Sepsis: The patient's vital signs and laboratory results suggest systemic inflammation and infection, which may progress to sepsis if not managed appropriately.

7. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

8. Renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function.

9. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels require careful monitoring and management.

10. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Hypotension, low-grade temperatures, hypothermia
   Concern for aspiration event yesterday during contrast administration.
   Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear etiology
 question
   pancreatitis.
   Now off of CVVH, changing to intermittent HD per renal recs.
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. Nl pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency (random [**Last Name (un) **] 20 [**5-20**]). Thromboembolic disease on
   the differential.
   - Broadened to meropenem yesterday, continue
   - Follow-up read of CT abdomen from yesterday
   - Obtain sputum culture today
   - Follow-up pending cultures, CIS
   - Keep in lines for now
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
 MAP goal 60
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Check LENIS
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear  purposful.
   Probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, medications.  Not interactive off of sedatives, now 6
   days without sedation.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct. TTE
   without evidence of vegetations.  Had been trying to ween down
   anticonvulsants due to concern these were contributing to sedation
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - Repeat EEG
   - Continue phenobarbitol, dilantin for now pending EEG
   - Maintain off propofol
   - Lactulose off
   - Repeat MRI early in week of [**5-24**]
   * Seizures.
   Shaking yesterday afternoon seemed more consistent with rigoring than
   seizures, nevertheless must have low suspicion for seizure activity esp
   in setting of weaning anticonvulsants and recurrent seizures here
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Given MRI findings ? septic infarcts serving as nidus for
   seizure activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and Phenobarbital, will maintain current doses
   - Repeat EEG today
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH (day 1=[**5-4**]). Added TMP-SMX for
   synergy. Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of
   TMP-SMX (day 1=[**5-10**]). Discuss TMP-SMX dosing for HD w pharmacy.
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   * Aspiration pna, suspected.
   - On meropenem as above
   - Obtaining sputum culture
   - Monitor chest x-ray, clinic examination
   * Pancreatitis, suspected. Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear
   etiology.
   - Follow-up read of CT abdomen
   - Monitor enzymes
   * Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - HD per renal recs, had been on CVVH
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely. Status post albumin. Liver consult has signed off.
   - Following LFTs
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - D/C
d lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, no metoprolol as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC: now resolved
   - Follow INR
   * Tachyarrhythmia.
   Resolved
   Pt had runs NSVT early in admission, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable.
   - continue to trend
   * DM2: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regular sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH with TF
   off prior to trach/peg
   * Respiratory failure: In the setting of CNS disease and sepsis.
   - Status post trach yesterday

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis. The patient's conditions include hypotension, low-grade temperatures, hypothermia, concern for aspiration event during contrast administration, pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear etiology (questionable pancreatitis), oliguric renal failure, transaminitis with history of cirrhosis, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) now resolved, tachyarrhythmia resolved, anemia (microcytic), thrombocytopenia (likely from cirrhosis), and respiratory failure in the setting of CNS disease and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening septic shock, development of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, progression of listerial infection leading to meningitis or abscess formation, further deterioration of renal function, worsening heart failure, recurrence of DIC or thrombocytopenia, and potential complications related to the patient's diabetes mellitus.

The patient's current treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem) for suspected listeriosis and aspiration pneumonia, ampicillin for listeriosis, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) due to renal failure, and various supportive measures"

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo with listeriosis meningitis and sepsis, remains on vasopressors.
   1. Listerosis
        - Continues on Bactrim
        - ampicillin switched to Meropenem last night to broaden coverage.
   1. Fevers
       - Unclear etiology--> ? aspiration given RLL infiltrate, vs biliary
   source, vs drug fever vs VTE.
          + f/u blood cultures and Abd CT scan.  [**Month (only) 8**] need HIDA scan
          + Will send sputum cultures
          + ? VTE --> will check LENIs; contraindication to anticoag but
   could place IVC filter
          + ? Drug fever --> No eosinophilia.  Will consider
   2. Hypotension with increased vasopressor requirement
         + Concern for infectious process / sepsis
         + f/u cultures
         + Urine with fungi --> less inclined to treat, but may reconsider
   if rest of evaluation negative
         + Unlikely cardiogenic given TTE showed improved cardiac function
         + Unlikely due to AI, given normal cortisol
         + Is this neurogenic shock?
         + MAP goal = 60 given underlying CNS dysfunction
   3.  Delta MS
         + Differential broad- toxic metabolic from renal failure,
   cirrhosis, infection.  Continued meningitis / cerebritis. Continued
   seizures?  Phenobarbital toxicity.
         + Will repeat EEG
         + Repeat phenobarbital level.
         + Seizures --> will remain on Dilantin and Phenobarb
         + Will repeat MRI / MRA next week for prognostication
         + Does have cirrhosis --> would ensure 3 BM daily
   4. ARF
         + Presumably [**1-25**] ATN from hypotension
         + Remains on CVVH.
          + I/O goal -1L (likely not pre-load dependent at this point)
   5.  s/p Tracheostomy
        + will continue trach care
   6. ICU
        + will start tube feeds today
        + FULL CODE
        + Access: A-line, TLC, HD catheter --> will consider changing
   lines
        + Prophy:  On SQ heparin, PPI
        + Dipso- needs ICU care.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis and DM.
- He was admitted with lethargy, diarrhea, fevers/chills, and deltaMS.
- The patient was found to have listeriosis sepsis and likely listeria meningitis with the possibility of seizures.
- The patient's course included MODs (stress cardiomyopathy), ARF requiring HD, poor mental status.
- The patient underwent a tracheostomy on [**5-21**] and a CT abdomen which was complicated by an aspiration event.
- The patient experienced fevers, rigors, and was on vasopressor support with Levophed.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/65 to 139/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm.
- The patient's neurological status is unresponsive with no assessed movement or tone.
- Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, normal platelet count, increased creatinine, and other abnormal values.
- The patient remains on multiple antibiotics and is being treated for various conditions including listeriosis, fevers of unclear etiology, hypotension, and delta MS (mental status changes).

        - ampicillin switched to Meropenem last night to broaden coverage.
   1. Fevers
       - Unclear etiology--> ? aspiration given RLL infiltrate, vs biliary
   source, vs drug fever vs VTE.
          + f/u blood cultures and Abd CT scan.  [**Month (only) 8**] need HIDA scan
          + Will send sputum cultures
          + ? VTE --> will check LENIs; contraindication to anticoag but
   could place IVC filter
          + ? Drug fever --> No eosinophilia.  Will consider
   2. Hypotension with increased vasopressor requirement
         + Concern for infectious process / sepsis
         + f/u cultures
         + Urine with fungi --> less inclined to treat, but may reconsider
   if rest of evaluation negative
         + Unlikely cardiogenic given TTE showed improved cardiac function
         + Unlikely due to AI, given normal cortisol
         + Is this neurogenic shock? Will add midodrine in effort to
   titrate of IV vasopressors.
         + MAP goal = 60 given underlying CNS dysfunction
   3.  Delta MS
         + Differential broad- toxic metabolic from renal failure,
   cirrhosis, infection.  Continued meningitis / cerebritis. Continued
   seizures?  Phenobarbital toxicity.
         + Will repeat EEG
         + Repeat phenobarbital level.
         + Seizures --> will remain on Dilantin and Phenobarb
         + Will repeat MRI / MRA next week for prognostication
         + Does have cirrhosis --> would ensure 3 BM daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis and DM who was admitted with lethargy, diarrhea, fevers/chills, and deltaMS. The patient has been diagnosed with listeriosis sepsis and likely listeria meningitis, which could potentially lead to seizures. 

The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including tracheostomy, RUQ US showing thickened GB wall and sludge, CT abdomen performed but results pending, and aspiration event during the procedure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis and DM admitted to the ICU with lethargy, diarrhea, fevers/chills, and delirium. He was found to have listeriosis sepsis and likely listeria meningitis with the potential for seizures. The patient's condition has been complicated by MODS (stress cardiomyopathy, ARF requiring HD, poor mental status). He underwent a tracheostomy and has had several changes in antibiotics due to new infections. The patient remains febrile, unresponsive, and on vasopressors. His prognosis is poor given the presence of MODS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Listerosis - The patient has listeriosis meningitis and sepsis, which requires continued treatment with appropriate antibiotics.
2. Fevers - The etiology of the fevers is unclear and could be due to aspiration, biliary source, drug fever, or venous thromboembolism (VTE). Further evaluation is needed, including blood cultures, abdominal CT scan, and sputum cultures.
3. Hypotension with increased vasopressor requirement - The patient's hypotension may be due to an infectious process or sepsis. Cultures should be followed, and consideration should be given to treating fungal infection if indicated. The patient's underlying CNS dysfunction should be considered when determining the target mean arterial pressure (MAP).
4. Delta MS - The patient's altered mental status may be due to toxic metabolic effects from renal failure, cirrhosis, infection, continued meningitis/cerebritis, or seizures. An EEG should be repeated, phenobarbital levels checked, and the patient should remain on Dilantin and Phenobarb.
5. ARF - The patient likely has acute renal failure, presumably due to hypotension and ATN. He remains on CVVH and should continue to have daily I/O goals.
6. Cirrhosis - The patient's cirrhosis may be related to EtOH use, and if he recovers, further evaluation including biopsy may be necessary.
7. s/p Tracheostomy - The patient will continue trach care.
8. ICU - The patient should start tube feeds today, has full code status, and requires ICU care.

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo with listeriosis meningitis and sepsis, remains unresponsive,
   febrile, on vasopressors.  With poor overall prognosis given MODS.
   1. Listerosis
        - Continues on Bactrim
        - ampicillin switched to Meropenem last night to broaden coverage.
   1. Fevers
       - Unclear etiology--> ? aspiration given RLL infiltrate, vs biliary
   source, vs drug fever vs VTE.
          + f/u blood cultures and Abd CT scan.  [**Month (only) 8**] need HIDA scan
          + Will send sputum cultures
          + ? VTE --> will check LENIs; contraindication to anticoag but
   could place IVC filter.
          + ? Drug fever --> No eosinophilia.  Will consider
   2. Hypotension with increased vasopressor requirement
         + Concern for infectious process / sepsis
         + f/u cultures
         + Urine with fungi --> less inclined to treat, but may reconsider
   if rest of evaluation negative
         + Unlikely cardiogenic given TTE showed improved cardiac function
         + Unlikely due to AI, given normal cortisol
         + Is this neurogenic shock? Will add midodrine in effort to
   titrate off IV vasopressors.
         + MAP goal = 60 given underlying CNS dysfunction
   3.  Delta MS
         + Differential broad- toxic metabolic from renal failure,
   cirrhosis, infection.  Continued meningitis / cerebritis. Continued
            seizures?  Phenobarbital toxicity.
         + Will repeat EEG
         + Repeat phenobarbital level.
         + Seizures --> will remain on Dilantin and Phenobarb
         + Will repeat MRI / MRA next week for prognostication
         + Does have cirrhosis --> would ensure 3 BM daily with lactulose
   and start Rifaximin.
   4. ARF
         + Presumably [**1-25**] ATN from hypotension
         + Remains on CVVH.
          + I/O goal -1L (likely not pre-load dependent at this point)
   5. Cirrhosis
        + Presumed [**1-25**] EtOH, though if recovers may require further eval,
   incl biopsy (Assoc b/t hemachromatosis and listeriosis).
   6.  s/p Tracheostomy
        + will continue trach care
   7. ICU
        + will start tube feeds today
        + FULL CODE
        + Access: A-line, TLC, HD catheter --> will consider changing
   lines
        + Prophy:  On SQ heparin, PPI
        + Dipso- needs ICU care.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Listeriosis: The patient has been diagnosed with listeriosis meningitis and sepsis. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat this infection.

2. Fevers: The patient is still febrile, and the etiology of the fever is unclear. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the fever, which may include aspiration pneumonia, biliary source, drug fever, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Blood cultures, abdominal CT scan, sputum cultures, and consideration of anticoagulation therapy for VTE should be considered.

3. Hypotension with increased vasopressor requirement: The patient's hypotension may be due to an infectious process or sepsis. Cultures should be monitored, and if fungal infection is suspected, urine culture should be sent. Treatment should focus on managing the underlying cause of the hypotension.

4. Delta MS: The patient's mental status changes could be due to various factors such as toxic metabolic encephalopathy from renal failure, cirrhosis, infection, continued meningitis/cerebritis, seizures, or phenobarbital toxicity. An EEG should be repeated, and phenobarbital levels should be checked. Seizure prophylaxis with Dilantin and Phenobarb should be continued, and an MRI/MRA should be repeated next week for progn"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Hypotension, low-grade temperatures, hypothermia
   Concern for aspiration event yesterday during contrast administration.
   Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear etiology
 question
   pancreatitis.
   Now off of CVVH, changing to intermittent HD per renal recs.
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. CNS dysfunction and thromboembolic disease also on
   the differential. Normal pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency (random [**Last Name (un) **] 20 [**5-20**]).
   - Broadened to meropenem yesterday, continue
   - Follow-up read of CT abdomen from yesterday
   - Obtain sputum culture today
   - Follow-up pending cultures, CIS
   - Keep in lines for now
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
 MAP goal 60
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Check LENIS
   - Will start midodrine post-dialysis in case of central dysfunction
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear  purposful.
   Probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, medications.  Not interactive off of sedatives, now 6
   days without sedation.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct. TTE
   without evidence of vegetations.  Had been trying to ween down
   anticonvulsants due to concern these were contributing to sedation
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - Repeat EEG
   - Continue phenobarbitol, dilantin for now pending EEG
   - Maintain off propofol
   - Lactulose off
   - Repeat MRI early in week of [**5-24**]
   * Seizures.
   Shaking yesterday afternoon seemed more consistent with rigoring than
   seizures, nevertheless must have low suspicion for seizure activity esp
   in setting of weaning anticonvulsants and recurrent seizures here
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Given MRI findings ? septic infarcts serving as nidus for
   seizure activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and Phenobarbital, will maintain current doses
   - Repeat EEG today
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH (day 1=[**5-4**]). Added TMP-SMX for
   synergy. Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of
   TMP-SMX (day 1=[**5-10**]). Discuss TMP-SMX dosing for HD w pharmacy.
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   * Aspiration pna, suspected.
   - On meropenem as above
   - Obtaining sputum culture
   - Monitor chest x-ray, clinic examination
   * Pancreatitis, suspected. Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear
   etiology.
   - Follow-up read of CT abdomen
   - Monitor enzymes
   * Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - HD per renal recs, had been on CVVH
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely. Status post albumin. Liver consult has signed off.
   - Following LFTs
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - D/C
d lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, no metoprolol as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC: now resolved
   - Follow INR
   * Tachyarrhythmia.
   Resolved
   Pt had runs NSVT early in admission, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is now experiencing multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications including hypotension, low-grade temperatures, hypothermia, altered mental status, seizures, aspiration pneumonia, pancreatitis, acute oliguric renal failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), anemia, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, cardiovascular drugs, anticoagulants, and others. He is also receiving nutritional support through enteral feeding. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he requires ongoing monitoring and management of his various medical conditions."

   4. Status post G-tube placement with small pneumoperitoneum.
   5. Possible gastric diverticulum, containing oral contrast, present
   since at
   least the comparison scan of [**2134-5-4**].
   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Hypotension, low-grade temperatures, hypothermia
   Concern for aspiration event yesterday during contrast administration.
   Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear etiology
 question
   pancreatitis.
   Now off of CVVH, changing to intermittent HD per renal recs.
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. CNS dysfunction and thromboembolic disease also on
   the differential. Normal pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency (random [**Last Name (un) **] 20 [**5-20**]).
   - Broadened to meropenem, continue
   - Follow-up read of CT abdomen from yesterday
   - Obtain sputum culture today
   - Follow-up pending cultures, CIS
   - Keep in lines for now
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
 MAP goal 60
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Check LENIS
   - Will start midodrine post-dialysis in case of central dysfunction
   * Altered mental status:
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear  purposful.
   Probably multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, medications.  Not interactive off of sedatives, now 6
   days without sedation.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct. TTE
   without evidence of vegetations.  Had been trying to ween down
   anticonvulsants due to concern these were contributing to sedation
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - Repeat EEG
   - Continue phenobarbitol, dilantin for now pending EEG
   - Maintain off propofol
   - Lactulose off
   - Repeat MRI early in week of [**5-24**]
   * Seizures.
   Shaking yesterday afternoon seemed more consistent with rigoring than
   seizures, nevertheless must have low suspicion for seizure activity esp
   in setting of weaning anticonvulsants and recurrent seizures here
   Pt has had multiple seizures may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity.  Given MRI findings ? septic infarcts serving as nidus for
   seizure activity
   - Ativan prn
   - Neuro recs appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and Phenobarbital, will maintain current doses
   - Repeat EEG today
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cx here w/o growth
   - Reculture if febrile, follow up pending micro at OSH re sensitivities
   - Continue ampicilin dose for CVVH (day 1=[**5-4**]). Added TMP-SMX for
   synergy. Anticipate 6 week course of amp, probably 3 week course of
   TMP-SMX (day 1=[**5-10**]). Discuss TMP-SMX dosing for HD w pharmacy.
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis would favor just
   treating him with 6wk CNS course. Will discuss with neuro re: ultility
   of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID recs appreciated
   * Aspiration pna, suspected.
   - On meropenem as above
   - Obtaining sputum culture
   - Monitor chest x-ray, clinic examination
   * Pancreatitis, suspected. Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear
   etiology.
   - Follow-up read of CT abdomen
   - Monitor enzymes
   * Acute oliguric renal failure:
   Most likely from ATN in the setting of hypotension.  Not fluid
   responsive. DDx includes ATN in setting of sepsis and recent vol
   depletion from diarrhea. Also consider HRS given cirrhosis. Abdominal
   compartment syndrome seems un likely. No IV contrast, from what I can
   tell from records. Could have AIN in the setting of abx but I think
   less likely.  Renal U/S w/o hydro.
   - HD per renal recs, had been on CVVH
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely. Status post albumin. Liver consult has signed off.
   - Following LFTs
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - D/C
d lactulose as does not appear to be helping mental status
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, no metoprolol as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC: now resolved
   - Follow INR
   * Tachyarrhythmia.
   Resolved
   Pt had runs NSVT early in admission, maintained BP at the time. Likely
   predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base disturbance in
   setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Stable
   on serial checks since yesterday. Pt did have borderline fibrinogen
   concerning for DIC
   - DIC labs every other day
   - daily hct, transfuse hb>7, T+S
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable.
   - continue to trend
   * DM2: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regular sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH with TF
   off prior to trach/peg
   * Respiratory failure: In the setting of CNS disease and sepsis.

   3. Unchanged cirrhosis and ascites.
   4. Status post G-tube placement with small pneumoperitoneum.
   5. Possible gastric diverticulum, containing oral contrast, present
   since at
   least the comparison scan of [**2134-5-4**].
   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Hypotension, low-grade temperatures, hypothermia
   Now with normal temperatures x 24 hours. Concern for aspiration event
   [**5-21**] during contrast administration. Pancreatic enzymes elevated of
   unclear etiology
 no evidence of pancreatitis or intraabdominal
   abscess on imaging. Now off of CVVH, changed to intermittent HD per
   renal recs.
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. CNS dysfunction and thromboembolic disease also on
   the differential. Normal pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency (random cortisol 20 [**5-20**]). LENIS negative [**5-22**].
   - Broadened to meropenem, continue
   - Follow-up pending cultures, CIS
   - Keep in lines for now
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
 MAP goal 60
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
   - Titrate midodrine as tolerated
   * Altered mental status.
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear purposful. Probably
   multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, medications. Not interactive off of sedatives, now 7
   days without sedation.  MRI showing persistent signs of
   meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct. TTE
   without evidence of vegetations.  Had been trying to wean down
   anticonvulsants due to concern these were contributing to sedation.
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - Repeat EEG
   - Continue phenobarbitol, dilantin for now pending further neurology
   input
   - Maintain off propofol
   - Started rifaxamin for potential contribution from liver disease
   - Repeat MRI early in week of [**5-24**]
   * Seizures.
   Shaking [**5-21**] seemed more consistent with rigoring than seizures,
   nevertheless must have low suspicion for seizure activity esp in
   setting of weaning anticonvulsants and recurrent seizures here. Pt has
   had multiple seizures that may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG showed persistent seizure
   activity. Given MRI findings question septic infarcts serving as nidus
   for seizure activity
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - Now on dilantin and phenobarbital pending further neurology input
   - Ativan prn
   - Repeat EEG today
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cultures here w/o growth
   - Initially on ampicillin started [**5-4**] with TMP-SMX added for synergy
   broadened to meropenem [**5-21**]. Anticipate 6 week course of antibiotics.
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis and would favor
   empirically treating him with 6-week CNS course. Will discuss with
   neuro re: ultility of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID input appreciated
   * Aspiration pneumonia, suspected.
   - On meropenem as above
   - Obtaining sputum culture
   - Monitor chest x-ray, clinic examination
   * Acute oliguric renal failure.
   Thought due to ATN in the setting of hypotension.
   - CVVH today for goal -500-1L
   - Renal input appreciated
   * Respiratory failure.
   - Status post trach
   - SBT today and trach mask if tolerates
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely. Status post albumin. Liver consult has signed off.
   - Following LFTs
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - Started lactulose
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, holding metoprolol as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC: Now resolved.
   - Follow INR
   * Tachyarrhythmia.
   Resolved. Pt had runs NSVT early in admission, maintained BP at the
   time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Now
   stable.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable.
   - Continue to trend
   * DM2: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regular sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH with TF
   off prior to trach/peg

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. The patient now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. He is hypotensive, with low-grade temperatures and hypothermia, but now has normal temperatures for the past 24 hours. The patient has elevated pancreatic enzymes of unclear etiology, no evidence of pancreatitis or intraabdominal abscess on imaging, and is off CVVH, changed to intermittent HD per renal recs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to sepsis, intravascular volume depletion, medications, or other factors.
2. CNS Dysfunction: The patient has altered mental status and seizures, which could be attributed to CNS listerial infection, hepatic encephalopathy, medications, or other causes.
3. Thromboembolic Disease: The patient's low platelet count and history of cirrhosis increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia and sepsis.
5. Acute Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension.
6. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to septic shock, medication toxicity, hepatic congestion, or other factors.
7. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF 15%) from either recent or remote myocardial infarction.
8. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation): The patient initially had signs of DIC but is now resolved.
9. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient experienced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), likely due to low EF, systemic infection, acid-base disturbance in the setting of renal failure.
10. Anemia and Thrombocytopenia: The patient has microcytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, likely from cirrhosis, and possibly exacerbated by DIC initially.
11. DM2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, with blood sugar levels being controlled with insulin.
12. Listeriosis: The patient likely has listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock, potentially leading to meningitis.

Note: This is not an exhaustive list of potential complications, but rather a summary of the main concerns based on the provided information."

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo with Listeria meningitis and septic shock with MODS, still
   critically ill, with continued vasopressor requirement and altered
   mental status.
   + Fevers
       - Has been afebrile for past 24 hours- did broaden Abx to meropenem
   in setting of aspiration and RLL infiltrate.
          Will complete 8 day course of Meropenem for presumed VAP
   ([**Date range (1) 6745**])
   + Hypotension
        - Initially due to Listeria sepsis, with component of cardiogenic
   shock in setting of stress cardiomyopathy.
        - Is this persistent sepsis versus neurogenic shock?
             + Did start midodrine, will uptitrate up  to 5mg tid in
   attempt to wean of  IV vasopressors (rationale is that patient likely
   has
                component of neurogenic shock; also this would help limit
   volume)
                 of neurogenic shock and pt vasodilated)
             + Less likely that this remains sepsis given afebrile,
   improved wbc.
   + Altered mental status
 thought to be multifactorial (seizures, toxic
   metabolic, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction)
        - f/u EEG
        - Will d/c phenobarbital given potential deltaMS due to that.
   Will d/w neuro anti-epileptic regimen (addition Keppra, titrate up
           Dilantin?)
        - Will repeat MRI next week to look for evolution of parenchymal
   lesions for prognostication
   + Renal failure
        -  Still with minimal urine output, with little liklihood of
   recovery of this ATN
        -  Did not tolerate HD yesterday, due to hypotension
        -  Will re-start CVVH today with goal I/O = -500 to -1L
             + Patient  likely  more preload dependent so will keep CVP~8.
   + Mechanical Ventilation
       - Will SBT today to see if patient can withstand coming off of
   mechanical ventilation.
   + Cardiomyopathy
       - TTE [**5-18**] showed improved function.
   + Diabetes
        - Sugars decently controlled (<180).
   + Cirrhosis
       - Presumed EtOH-associated. Will need fiurther w/u as outpatient
       - Continue lactulose and Rifaximin in case patient
s deltaMS due to

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes, hypertension, and EtOH-induced cirrhosis. He was admitted with complaints of diarrhea, lethargy, fevers, and chills. He was found to have listeria meningitis and septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), seizure activity, stress cardiomyopathy (now improved), coma, and persistent vegetative state. He underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient continues to require vasopressors and has low-grade fevers. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/55 mmHg to 134/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 531 mL, respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 59, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 20 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated potassium levels, elevated liver enzymes, and low albumin levels. Imaging studies reveal small lung volumes on chest X-ray and continued right lower lobe ("

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo with Listeria meningitis and septic shock with MODS, still
   critically ill, with continued vasopressor requirement and altered
   mental status.
   + Fevers
       - Has been afebrile for past 24 hours- did broaden Abx to meropenem
   in setting of aspiration and RLL infiltrate.
          Will complete 8 day course of Meropenem for presumed VAP
   ([**Date range (1) 6745**])
   + Hypotension
        - Initially due to Listeria sepsis, with component of cardiogenic
   shock in setting of stress cardiomyopathy.
        - Is this persistent sepsis versus neurogenic shock?
             + Did start midodrine, will uptitrate up  to 5mg tid in
   attempt to wean of  IV vasopressors (rationale is that patient likely
   has
                component of neurogenic shock; also this would help limit
   volume)
                 of neurogenic shock and pt vasodilated)
             + Less likely that this remains sepsis given afebrile,
   improved wbc.
   + Altered mental status
 thought to be multifactorial (seizures, toxic
   metabolic, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction)
        - f/u EEG
        - Will d/c phenobarbital given potential deltaMS due to that.
   Will d/w neuro anti-epileptic regimen (addition Keppra, titrate up
           Dilantin?)
        - Will repeat MRI next week to look for evolution of parenchymal
   lesions for prognostication
   + Renal failure
        -  Still with minimal urine output, with little liklihood of
   recovery of this ATN
        -  Did not tolerate HD yesterday, due to hypotension
        -  Will re-start CVVH today with goal I/O = -500 to -1L
             + Patient  likely  more preload dependent so will keep CVP~8.
   + Mechanical Ventilation
       - Will SBT today to see if patient can withstand coming off of
   mechanical ventilation.
   + Cardiomyopathy
       - TTE [**5-18**] showed improved function.
   + Diabetes
        - Sugars decently controlled (<180).
   + Cirrhosis
       - Presumed EtOH-associated. Will need fiurther w/u as outpatient
       - Continue lactulose and Rifaximin in case patient
s deltaMS due to
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   + Coagulopathy
       - Will replete with vit K  5mg po x 3 days

   substantially with assessment and plan as outlined on interdisciplinary

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and ethanol-induced cirrhosis. He was admitted with complaints of diarrhea, lethargy, fevers, and chills. The patient was found to have listeria meningitis and septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He developed acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), stress cardiomyopathy (improved), seizure activity, and is currently in a persistent vegetative state.

The patient has been on multiple antibiotics including ampicillin, vancomycin, Bactrim, meropenem, and phenobarbital. He is currently on midodrine, a medication used to treat low blood pressure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/55 to 134/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, and altered liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal small lung volumes on chest X-ray and a tracheostomy tube in place. 

The patient's current assessment includes ongoing hypotension, fevers, altered mental status, renal failure, mechanical ventilation, and cardiomyopathy. The plan"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ethanol-induced cirrhosis. He was admitted with complaints of diarrhea, lethargy, fevers, and chills. The patient was found to have listeria meningitis and septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). His course has been complicated by acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), seizure activity, stress cardiomyopathy (now improved), and coma. An MRI showed meningeal enhancement and parenchymal lesions. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient continues to require vasopressors and has low-grade fevers. He is in a persistent vegetative state. The last dose of antibiotics was administered on [2134-5-21].

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo with Listeria meningitis and septic shock with MODS, still
   critically ill, with continued fevers, vasopressor requirement and
   altered mental status.
   + Fevers
       - Has been afebrile for past 24 hours- did broaden Abx to meropenem
   in setting of aspiration and RLL infiltrate.
          Will complete 8 day course of Meropenem for presumed VAP
   ([**Date range (1) 6745**])
   + Hypotension
        - Initially due to Listeria sepsis, with component of cardiogenic
   shock in setting of stress cardiomyopathy.
        - Is this persistent sepsis versus neurogenic shock?
             + Did start midodrine, will uptitrate up  to 5mg tid in
   attempt to wean of  IV vasopressors (rationale that this is a component
                 of neurogenic shock and pt vasodilated)
             + [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6746**] that this remains sepsis given afebrile,
   improved wbc.
   + Altered mental status
 thought to be multifactorial (seizures, toxic
   metabolic, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction)
        - f/u EEG
        - Will d/c phenobarbital given potential deltaMS due to that.
   Will d/w neuro anti-epileptic regimen
        - Will repeat MRI next week, to look for evolution of parenchymal
   lesions for prognostication
   + Renal failure
        -  Still with minimal urine output, with little liklihood of
   recovery of this ATN
        -  Did not tolerate HD yesterday, due to hypotension
        -  Will re-start CVVH today with goal I/O = -500 to -1L
             + Patient  likely preload dependent so will keep CVP 8-12.
   + Mechanical Ventilation
       - Will SBT today to see if patient can withstand coming off of
   mechanical ventilation.
   + Cardiomyopathy
       - TTE [**5-18**] showed improved function.
   + Diabetes
        - Sugars well controlled.
   + Cirrhosis
       - Presumed EtOH-associated. Will need fiurther w/u as outpatient
       - Continue lactulose and Rifaximin in case patient
s deltaMS due to
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   + Coagulopathy
       - Will replete with vit K  5mg po x 3 days

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ethanol-induced cirrhosis. He was admitted with complaints of diarrhea, lethargy, fever, and chills. The patient was found to have Listeria meningitis and septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). His course has been complicated by acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), seizure activity, stress cardiomyopathy (now improved), and coma with MRI showing meningeal enhancement and parenchymal lesions.

Currently, the patient is on mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and has a tracheostomy in place. He is also receiving tube feeds through a PEG tube. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C (99.3 F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/55 mmHg to 134/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine, and altered liver function tests. Imaging reveals small lung volumes, right IJ TLC, tracheostomy tube, and continued RLL infiltrate on chest X-ray.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of fevers, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient's altered mental status is"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Altered mental status
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear purposful. Probably
   multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, medications. Not interactive off of sedatives.  MRI
   showing persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of
   possible septic infarct. TTE without evidence of vegetations.  Had been
   trying to wean down anticonvulsants due to concern these were
   contributing to sedation.
   Had questionable seizure (vs rigoring) [**5-21**] in setting of weaning
   anticonvulsants end of last week, no further clear episodes of seizures
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - Repeat EEG
   - Continue phenobarbitol, dilantin for now pending further neurology
   input. Hold off on further anticonvulsant weaning.
   - Repeat MRI early in week of [**5-24**]
   - Started rifaxamin for potential contribution from liver disease
   - Maintain off propofol
   * Seizures.
   Shaking [**5-21**] seemed more consistent with rigoring than seizures,
   nevertheless must have low suspicion for seizure activity esp in
   setting of weaning anticonvulsants and recurrent seizures here. Pt has
   had multiple seizures that may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG earlier in admit with
   persistent seizure activity. Given MRI findings question septic
   infarcts serving as nidus for seizure activity
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - EEG, anticonvulsants plan as above
   * Aspiration pneumonia, suspected.
   Pt with witnessed aspiration event [**5-21**], subsequently evidence of R
   base consolidation and increased O2 requirement. Now O2 requirement
   near baseline with minimal secretions. Sputum growing only yeast.
   - Continue meropenem
   - Aspiration precautions
   - Follow O2 requirement, daily CXR
   * Hypothermia
   Recently with low grade temps (99s) but hypothermic again to 96 in last
   day on CVVH.  ?Persistent/untreated infection, but recent micro has
   been negative. Concern for aspiration event [**5-21**] during contrast
   administration. Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear etiology
   evidence of pancreatitis or intraabdominal abscess on imaging. LENIS
   negative [**5-22**].
   - Broaded amp to meropenem on [**5-21**], will continue for now
   - Follow up pending micro and CIS
   - Keep in lines for now
   * Hypotension
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. CNS dysfunction and thromboembolic disease also on
   the differential. Normal pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency (random cortisol 20 [**5-20**]).
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
 MAP goal 60
   - Currently on midodrine AND levophed, would favor DCing midodrine
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cultures here w/o growth
   - Initially on ampicillin started [**5-4**] with TMP-SMX added for synergy
   [**5-10**]
 broadened to meropenem [**5-21**]. Anticipate 6 week course of
   antibiotics.
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis and would favor
   empirically treating him with 6-week CNS course. Will discuss with
   neuro re: ultility of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID input appreciated
   * Acute oliguric renal failure.
   Thought due to ATN in the setting of hypotension.
   - CVVH today for goal -500-1L
   - Renal input appreciated
   * Respiratory failure.
   - Status post trach
   - Trach mask as tolerates
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely. Status post albumin. Liver consult has signed off.
   - Following LFTs
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - Holding lactulose, on rifaximin
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, holding metoprolol as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC: Now resolved.
   - Follow INR
   * Tachyarrhythmia.
   Resolved. Pt had runs NSVT early in admission, maintained BP at the
   time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis. The patient's altered mental status persists, likely multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic encephalopathy, and medications. The MRI shows persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of possible septic infarct. The patient has been trying to wean down anticonvulsants due to concern these were contributing to sedation. Neurology input is appreciated, and a repeat EEG is needed. The patient will continue on phenobarbital and dilantin for now pending further neurology input. Hold off on further anticonvulsant weaning. A repeat MRI early in the week of [**5-24**] is also recommended.

The patient has had multiple seizures that may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG earlier in admit with persistent seizure activity. Given MRI findings question septic infarcts serving as nidus for seizure activity. Neurology input is appreciated, and EEG, anticonvulsants plan as above.

Aspiration pneumonia is suspected due to a witnessed aspiration event, subsequent evidence of right base consolidation, and increased O2 requirement. Sputum is growing only yeast. Continue meropenem,"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Altered mental status
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear purposful. Probably
   multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, medications. Not interactive off of sedatives.  MRI
   showing persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of
   possible septic infarct. TTE without evidence of vegetations.  Had been
   trying to wean down anticonvulsants due to concern these were
   contributing to sedation.
   Had questionable seizure (vs rigoring) [**5-21**] in setting of weaning
   anticonvulsants end of last week, no further clear episodes of seizures
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - Repeat EEG
   - Continue phenobarbitol, dilantin for now pending further neurology
   input. Hold off on further anticonvulsant weaning.
   - Repeat MRI early in week of [**5-24**]
   - Started rifaxamin for potential contribution from liver disease
   - Maintain off propofol
   * Seizures.
   Shaking [**5-21**] seemed more consistent with rigoring than seizures,
   nevertheless must have low suspicion for seizure activity esp in
   setting of weaning anticonvulsants and recurrent seizures here. Pt has
   had multiple seizures that may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG earlier in admit with
   persistent seizure activity. Given MRI findings question septic
   infarcts serving as nidus for seizure activity
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - EEG, anticonvulsants plan as above
   - Attempt to wean off phenobarb
   - Repeat MRI to asses for interval change to help prognosticate
   * Aspiration pneumonia, suspected.
   Pt with witnessed aspiration event [**5-21**], subsequently evidence of R
   base consolidation and increased O2 requirement. Now O2 requirement
   near baseline with minimal secretions. Sputum growing only yeast.
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], restart amp, day 1=[**5-4**]
   - Aspiration precautions
   - Follow O2 requirement, daily CXR
   * Hypothermia
   Recently with low grade temps (99s) but hypothermic again to 96 in last
   day on CVVH.  ?Persistent/untreated infection, but recent micro has
   been negative. Concern for aspiration event [**5-21**] during contrast
   administration. Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear etiology
   evidence of pancreatitis or intraabdominal abscess on imaging. LENIS
   negative [**5-22**].
   - Resume amp and d/c meropenem
   - Follow up pending micro and CIS
   - Keep in lines for now
   * Hypotension
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. CNS dysfunction and thromboembolic disease also on
   the differential. Normal pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency (random cortisol 20 [**5-20**]).
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
 MAP goal 60, will d/c levo and see what
   happens to his BP
   - Currently on midodrine AND levophed, would D/C midodrine today
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cultures here w/o growth
   - Initially on ampicillin started [**5-4**] with TMP-SMX added for synergy
   [**5-10**]
 broadened to meropenem [**5-21**]. Anticipate 6 week course of
   antibiotics.  Change back to amp today
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis and would favor
   empirically treating him with 6-week CNS course. Will discuss with
   neuro re: ultility of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID input appreciated
   * Acute oliguric renal failure.
   Thought due to ATN in the setting of hypotension.
   - CVVH today for goal -500-1L
   - Renal input appreciated
   * Respiratory failure.
   - Status post trach
   - Trach mask as tolerates
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely. Status post albumin. Liver consult has signed off.
   - Following LFTs
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - Holding lactulose, on rifaximin
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, holding metoprolol as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC: Now resolved.
   - Follow INR
   * Tachyarrhythmia.
   Resolved. Pt had runs NSVT early in admission, maintained BP at the
   time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Now
   stable.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable.
   - Continue to trend
   * DM2: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regular sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH if TFs off

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He has since developed multiorgan system failure and is presumed to have meningitis/cerebritis. The patient's altered mental status persists, with some eye opening but no purposeful responses. MRI findings show persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis and possible septic infarct. The patient has had multiple seizures, which may be due to CNS listeria infection. He also has hypotension, which is likely multifactorial and includes medications, sepsis, intravascular volume depletion, CNS dysfunction, and thromboembolic disease. Other complications include aspiration pneumonia, hypothermia, acute oliguric renal failure, respiratory failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. CNS Listeria Infection: The patient's altered mental status and persistent seizure activity may indicate a CNS listeria infection. Further neurology input is appreciated, and an EEG is recommended to assess for seizure activity. MRI findings show signs of meningitis/cerebritis, which supports the diagnosis of CNS infection.

   >Hypothermia and rigors:  had an ? pf aspiration event on [**5-21**] (during
   CT scan). CT abd /pelv on [**5-21**]: essentially unremarkable.  Has been
   afebrile on Abx will d/c meropenem today.
    - Has been afebrile for past 24 hours-d/c meropenem (ng clx,
   unimpressive CXR)
    Listeriosis: go back to ampicillin (d 1 = [**5-4**], stopped on [**4-26**])
   and bactrim ( d1 =  [**5-10**]). D/c
   > Hypotension: unclear etiology with likely low grade SIRS and ?
   neurogenic components as well as his anti-epileptic regimen (still on
   phenobarb but likely to be present for a while given underlying )
   - will stop phenobarb
   - Initially due to Listeria sepsis, with component of cardiogenic shock
   in setting of stress cardiomyopathy.
   -  Will trial off NE.
   - Cortisol was nl last week.
   > Altered mental status
 thought to be multifactorial (seizures, toxic
   metabolic, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction)
    - f/u EEG
   - stop phenobarb today.
    - Will repeat MRI to look for evolution of parenchymal lesions for
   prognostication
    > Renal failure   Did not tolerate HD yesterday, due to hypotension,
   now back on CVVH
   -  essentially anuric.  Little liklihood of recovery of this ATN
   -  Will re-start CVVH today with goal I/O = even and off NE

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with Listeria meningitis and septic shock, currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypothermia and rigors, altered mental status, renal failure, mechanical ventilation, cardiomyopathy, and EtOH cirrhosis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is unclear etiology and may have low-grade SIRS and neurogenic components. This could be due to sepsis or cardiogenic shock.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is thought to be multifactorial, including seizures, toxic metabolic, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's neurological status and consider further investigations such as EEG and MRI.
3. Renal failure: The patient did not tolerate hemodialysis (HD) yesterday due to hypotension and is now back on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient is essentially anuric, indicating a lack of urine output. There is a little likelihood of recovery of this acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
4. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is tolerating tracheostomy well and is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, spontaneous Vt of 583 mL, respiratory rate ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Listeria meningitis and septic shock, now presenting with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and a very poor prognosis. He has been critically ill and is still in the ICU. The patient experienced an aspiration event during a CT scan on [**5-21**]. His abdomen and pelvis CT scan showed no remarkable findings. He has been afebrile for the past 24 hours and will discontinue meropenem today. 

The patient's hypothermia and rigors were likely due to an aspiration event, which resulted in an unimpressive chest X-ray. Listeriosis treatment will include going back on ampicillin and bactrim. The cause of hypotension is unclear, with possible low-grade SIRS and neurogenic components, as well as the anti-epileptic regimen (phenobarb). 

The patient's altered mental status is thought to be multifactorial, including seizures, toxic metabolic, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. An EEG will be followed up, and phenobarb will be stopped today. Another MRI will be done to look for evolution of parenchymal lesions for prognostication.

The patient has renal failure and did not tolerate hemodialysis (HD) yesterday due to hypotension, so he is back on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). He is essentially an"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a diagnosis of Listeria meningitis and septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient continues to be critically ill, requiring ongoing vasopressor support and exhibiting altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension due to Listeria sepsis and component of cardiogenic shock in the setting of stress cardiomyopathy. The persistence of hypotension may indicate ongoing sepsis or neurogenic shock. The plan includes uptitration of midodrine to wean off IV vasopressors, considering the likelihood of neurogenic shock.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is thought to be multifactorial, including seizures, toxic metabolic, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. An EEG has been ordered, and phenobarbital will be discontinued due to potential delta MS. A neuro anti-epileptic regimen will be added, and an MRI will be repeated next week to look for prognostication.

3. Renal failure: The patient still exhibits minimal urine output with little likelihood of recovery of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) will be restarted today with a goal of I/O = -500 to -1L, considering the patient's preload dependency and CVP level of approximately 8.

4. Mechanical ventilation: A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be conducted today to determine if the patient can withstand coming off mechanical ventilation.

5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has shown improvement in cardiac function on echocardiography (TTE on 5-18).

6. EtOH cirrhosis: This is mentioned as an additional issue but does not have specific interventions or concerns mentioned in the progress note.

7. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, and vitamin K repletion will be administered for 3 days.

Additional issues noted by the ICU resident include nutrition, glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis measures. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is currently in the ICU. The patient's critical condition requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Altered mental status
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear purposful. Probably
   multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, medications. Not interactive off of sedatives.  MRI
   showing persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of
   possible septic infarct. TTE without evidence of vegetations.  Had been
   trying to wean down anticonvulsants due to concern these were
   contributing to sedation.  Had questionable seizure (vs rigoring) [**5-21**]
   in setting of weaning anticonvulsants end of last week, no further
   clear episodes of seizures
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - f/u EEG results
   - Continue phenobarbitol, dilantin for now pending further neurology
   input. Hold off on further anticonvulsant weaning.
   - MRI head today
   - Started rifaxamin for potential contribution from liver disease
   - Maintain off propofol
   * Seizures.
   Shaking [**5-21**] seemed more consistent with rigoring than seizures,
   nevertheless must have low suspicion for seizure activity esp in
   setting of weaning anticonvulsants and recurrent seizures here. Pt has
   had multiple seizures that may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG earlier in admit with
   persistent seizure activity. Given MRI findings question septic
   infarcts serving as nidus for seizure activity
   - appreciate neuro recs
   - EEG, anticonvulsants plan as above
   - Attempt to wean off phenobarb
   - Repeat MRI to asses for interval change to help prognosticate
   * Aspiration pneumonia, suspected.
   Pt with witnessed aspiration event [**5-21**], subsequently evidence of R
   base consolidation and increased O2 requirement. Now O2 requirement
   near baseline with minimal secretions. Sputum growing only yeast.
   - continue amp, day 1=[**5-4**]
   - Aspiration precautions
   - Follow O2 requirement, daily CXR
   * Hypothermia
   Recently with low grade temps (99s) but hypothermic again to 96 in last
   day on CVVH.  ?Persistent/untreated infection, but recent micro has
   been negative. Concern for aspiration event [**5-21**] during contrast
   administration. Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear etiology
   evidence of pancreatitis or intraabdominal abscess on imaging. LENIS
   negative [**5-22**].
   - Resume ampiciliin
   - Follow up pending micro and CIS
   - Keep in lines for now
   * Hypotension
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. CNS dysfunction and thromboembolic disease also on
   the differential. Normal pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency (random cortisol 20 [**5-20**]).
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
 MAP goal 60, continue to attempt to wean
   levophed
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cultures here w/o growth
   - Initially on ampicillin started [**5-4**] with TMP-SMX added for synergy
   [**5-10**]
 broadened to meropenem [**5-21**], now back to ampicillin. Anticipate
   6 week course of antibiotics.  Change back to amp today
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis and would favor
   empirically treating him with 6-week CNS course. Will discuss with
   neuro re: ultility of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID input appreciated
   * Acute oliguric renal failure.
   Thought due to ATN in the setting of hypotension.
   - CVVH today for goal -500-1L
   - Renal input appreciated
   * Respiratory failure.
   - Status post trach
   - Trach mask as tolerates
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely. Status post albumin. Liver consult has signed off.
   - Following LFTs
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - Holding lactulose, on rifaximin
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, holding metoprolol as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC: Now resolved.
   - Follow INR
   * Tachyarrhythmia.
   Resolved. Pt had runs NSVT early in admission, maintained BP at the
   time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Now
   stable.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable.
   - Continue to trend
   * DM2: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regular sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH if TFs off

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock likely secondary to listeriosis. He continues to have altered mental status and persistent seizures. The patient has multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and is presumed to have meningitis/cerebritis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely multifactorial and may include medications, sepsis, intravascular volume depletion, CNS dysfunction, and thromboembolic disease.
2. Hypothermia: The patient has been experiencing low-grade temperatures, which could be due to persistent infection or untreated infection, especially considering the recent microbe negative results. There is also concern for aspiration during contrast administration.
3. Hypoxia: The patient requires supplemental oxygen and has an increased O2 requirement, indicating possible respiratory compromise.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute oliguric renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension.
5. Liver failure: The patient has transaminitis with a history of cirrhosis, likely due to sepsis-induced liver injury. Other possible causes include medication toxicity and hepatic congestion.
6. Systolic heart failure: The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of 15% from either recent or remote myocardial infarction (MI).
7. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient initially had evidence of DIC, which has now resolved.
8. Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia, likely due to blood loss in the setting of intravenous fluid administration.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is likely due to cirrhosis and possibly exacerbated by DIC initially.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise in this patient based on the provided information."

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Altered mental status
   Persists.  Some eye opening now but does not appear purposful. Probably
   multifactorial with CNS listerial infection, seizures, hepatic
   encephalopathy, medications. Not interactive off of sedatives.  MRI
   showing persistent signs of meningitis/cerebritis, and areas of
   possible septic infarct. TTE without evidence of vegetations.  Had been
   trying to wean down anticonvulsants due to concern these were
   contributing to sedation.
   Had questionable seizure (vs rigoring) [**5-21**] in setting of weaning
   anticonvulsants end of last week, no further clear episodes of seizures
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - Repeat EEG
   - Continue phenobarbitol, dilantin for now pending further neurology
   input. Hold off on further anticonvulsant weaning.
   - Repeat MRI early in week of [**5-24**]
   - Started rifaxamin for potential contribution from liver disease
   - Maintain off propofol
   * Seizures.
   Shaking [**5-21**] seemed more consistent with rigoring than seizures,
   nevertheless must have low suspicion for seizure activity esp in
   setting of weaning anticonvulsants and recurrent seizures here. Pt has
   had multiple seizures that may be due to CNS listeria infection. CT
   head noncontrast without mass or abscess. EEG earlier in admit with
   persistent seizure activity. Given MRI findings question septic
   infarcts serving as nidus for seizure activity
   - Neurology input appreciated
   - EEG, anticonvulsants plan as above
   - Attempt to wean off phenobarb
   - Repeat MRI to asses for interval change to help prognosticate
   * Aspiration pneumonia, suspected.
   Pt with witnessed aspiration event [**5-21**], subsequently evidence of R
   base consolidation and increased O2 requirement. Now O2 requirement
   near baseline with minimal secretions. Sputum growing only yeast.
   - d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], restart amp, day 1=[**5-4**]
   - Aspiration precautions
   - Follow O2 requirement, daily CXR
   * Hypothermia
   Recently with low grade temps (99s) but hypothermic again to 96 in last
   day on CVVH.  ?Persistent/untreated infection, but recent micro has
   been negative. Concern for aspiration event [**5-21**] during contrast
   administration. Pancreatic enzymes elevated of unclear etiology
   evidence of pancreatitis or intraabdominal abscess on imaging. LENIS
   negative [**5-22**].
   - Resume amp and d/c meropenem
   - Follow up pending micro and CIS
   - Keep in lines for now
   * Hypotension
   Low BPs likely multifactorial
 may include meds, sepsis, intravascular
   volume depletion. CNS dysfunction and thromboembolic disease also on
   the differential. Normal pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of
   adrenal insufficiency (random cortisol 20 [**5-20**]).
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
 MAP goal 60, will d/c levo and see what
   happens to his BP
   - Currently on midodrine AND levophed, would D/C midodrine today
   - Follow lactate daily, recently stable
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy.
   - Blood cultures here w/o growth
   - Initially on ampicillin started [**5-4**] with TMP-SMX added for synergy
   [**5-10**]
 broadened to meropenem [**5-21**]. Anticipate 6 week course of
   antibiotics.  Change back to amp today
   - ID recommending LP - but very likely had meningitis and would favor
   empirically treating him with 6-week CNS course. Will discuss with
   neuro re: ultility of LP -> not indicated currently
   - ID input appreciated
   * Acute oliguric renal failure.
   Thought due to ATN in the setting of hypotension.
   - CVVH today for goal -500-1L
   - Renal input appreciated
   * Respiratory failure.
   - Status post trach
   - Trach mask as tolerates
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   LFTS have been trending down/stable and cont to do so. In setting of
   sepsis likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic
   congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis less
   likely. Status post albumin. Liver consult has signed off.
   - Following LFTs
   - Holding spironolactone
   - Elevated bilis may reflect lag in liver recovery. Also consider
   contrib from hemolysis (DIC) which is slowly improving
   - Holding lactulose, on rifaximin
   * Systolic heart failure w/ EF 15% from either recent or remote MI.
   - Continue ASA, holding metoprolol as low blood pressure
   - Monitor on telemetry given NSVT
   * DIC: Now resolved.
   - Follow INR
   * Tachyarrhythmia.
   Resolved. Pt had runs NSVT early in admission, maintained BP at the
   time. Likely predisposed with low EF, systemic infection, acid base
   disturbance in setting of renal failure
   - Continue monitoring on telemetry
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Now
   stable.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable.
   - Continue to trend
   * DM2: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regular sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH if TFs off

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. The patient continues to experience altered mental status and persistent seizures, for which he is on anticonvulsants. 

The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, but currently has minimal secretions and his oxygen requirement is near baseline. Sputum culture only shows yeast, and the aspiration precautions are being continued. 

The patient also has hypothermia, which may be due to persistent/untreated infection, recent contrast administration, or pancreatitis/intraabdominal abscess on imaging. 

Additionally, the patient has hypotension, which is likely multifactorial and includes medications, sepsis, intravascular volume depletion, CNS dysfunction, and thromboembolic disease. 

Other conditions noted in the progress note include listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock, acute oliguric renal failure, respiratory failure, transaminitis with history of cirrhosis, systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, DIC (which is now resolved), tachyarrhythmia (which has resolved), anemia (microcytic), thrombocytopenia, and DM2. 

The patient's current medications include norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. 

The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, elevated pancreatic enzymes, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and elevated lactate levels. 

Overall, the patient's medical complications include septic shock secondary to listeriosis, multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, difficult-to-control seizures, aspiration pneumonia, hypothermia, hypotension, acute oliguric renal failure, respiratory failure, transaminitis, systolic heart failure, DIC, tachyarrhythmia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and DM2."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He continues to experience altered mental status and persistent seizures, for which he is on anticonvulsants. The patient has multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis, as indicated by MRI findings. There are no vegetations on TTE.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient had a witnessed aspiration event, and there is evidence of right base consolidation and increased O2 requirement. Sputum is growing only yeast. The patient should continue on ampicillin, and aspiration precautions should be maintained. Daily CXR should be followed to monitor progress.

2. Hypothermia: The patient has been hypothermic again to 96 degrees in the last day on CVVH. Possible causes include persistent/untreated infection, but recent microbiology has been negative. Concern for aspiration event during contrast administration is also present. Pancreatic enzymes are elevated, possibly due to pancreatitis or intraabdominal abscess on imaging. LENIS negative.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressures are likely multifactorial, including medications, sepsis, intravascular volume depletion, CNS dysfunction, and thromboembolic disease. Normal pump function on repeat echo, no evidence of adrenal insufficiency (random cortisol 20). Pressors should be weaned as tolerated, with a MAP goal of 60. Levophed should be continued.

4. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient likely has meningitis as presented with headache and lethargy. Blood cultures are negative, and he was initially on ampicillin started on [**5-4**] with TMP-SMX added for synergy on [**5-10**]. Broadened to meropenem on [**5-21**], now back to ampicillin. A 6-week course of antibiotics is anticipated. ID recommending LP, but very likely had meningitis and would favor empirically treating him with a 6-week CNS course.

5. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is thought to be due to ATN in the setting of hypotension. CVVH was initiated today for goal -500-1L. Renal input is appreciated.

6. Respiratory failure: The patient is status post tracheostomy and currently on trach mask as tolerated.

7. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis: The patient's liver function tests have been trending down/stable and continue to do so. In the setting of sepsis, it is likely from shock liver. DDx includes med toxicity, hepatic congestion in setting of low EF. Acute infectious hepatitis is less likely. Status post albumin. Liver consult has signed off."

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Altered mental status: seems to be improving slightly as he responds
   to painful stimuli and has spontaneous eye opening, also turns head to
   voice.
   -f/u neuro recs
   -f/u EEG
   -stopped pehnobarb on [**2134-5-24**]
   -continue dilantin- recheck level on [**5-27**] or [**5-28**]
   -continue treatment for likely listeria meningitis and cerebritis
   -repeat MRI for prognostic information, family mtg following MRI
   results for goals of care discussion
   * Seizures: no seizure since [**34**] days prior.
   -continue dilantin, f/u neuro recs, MRI head as above, f/u EEG
   -off phenobarb
   * Aspiration pneumonia, suspected.
   -no infiltrate on X ray
   -d/c
d meropenem, continue amp / bactrim for listeria
   -wean FiO2
   * Hypothermia: continue abx for listeria.  f/u pending cultures.
   -f/u cultures
   -check TSH
   * Hypotension: possibly related to sepsis / listeria however on
   treatment for this, also likely component of third spacing, has
   anasarca.
   -continue ampicillin
   -not adrenally insufficient
   -check lactate
   -check TSH
   -echo normal
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy
   -f/u repeat cultures
   -continue amp / bactrim
   * Acute oliguric renal failure.
   Thought due to ATN in the setting of hypotension.
   - CVVH today for goal even
   - Renal input appreciated
   * Respiratory failure.
   - Status post trach
   - Trach mask as tolerates
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   -trend LFTs, hold spironolactone, MS w/o response to lactulose,
   continue rifaximin
   * DIC: Now resolved.
   - Follow INR
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Now
   stable.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable.
   - Continue to trend
   * DM2: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regular sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH if TFs off

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. The patient continues to experience altered mental status and persistent seizures, for which he is being treated with anticonvulsants.

The patient has been changed back to ampicillin from meropenem due to a lack of evidence for aspiration pneumonia. His allergies include nadolol, propranolol, and lidocaine Hcl/epinephrine. The last dose of antibiotics was Bactrim at 06:07 PM on 2134-5-22, followed by meropenem at 10:04 AM on 2134-5-24, and then ampicillin at 05:55 AM on 2134-5-25.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of norepinephrine and calcium gluconate (CRRT), as well as potassium chloride (KCl) (CRRT). He is also on heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and other ICU medications. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings are detailed in the flow sheet data.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Listeria meningitis and septic shock, currently experiencing multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is critically ill and has a very poor prognosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Hypothermia: The patient is currently hypothermic with a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F). If left untreated, this could lead to further drop in body temperature, increasing the risk of complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or organ dysfunction.

2. Rigors: The patient had an episode of rigors, which could be indicative of an infection or inflammatory response. This may increase the risk of complications like pneumonia or sepsis if not properly managed.

3. Aspiration event: The patient had an aspiration event during a CT scan. Aspiration can lead to lung infections such as pneumonia, which can further compromise respiratory function and increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

4. Listeriosis: The patient has a history of Listeria meningitis and requires a six-week course of ampicillin and bactrim to treat listeriosis. If the treatment is not administered correctly, the infection may persist or worsen, leading to ongoing systemic inflammation and potential complications.

5. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, which may be due to low-grade SIRS, neurogenic components, and his anti-"

   neurogenic components as well as his anti-epileptic regimen (still on
   phenobarb but likely to be present for a while given underlying )
   - will stop phenobarb
   - Initially due to Listeria sepsis, with component of cardiogenic shock
   in setting of stress cardiomyopathy.
   -  Will trial off NE.
   - Cortisol was nl last week.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Listeria meningitis and septic shock, now presenting with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and a very poor prognosis. The patient has several ongoing issues, including hypothermia and rigors, listeriosis, hypotension of unclear etiology, altered mental status, renal failure, mechanical ventilation, cardiomyopathy, and etoh cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia and rigors: The patient experienced an aspiration event during a CT scan, which could lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia.
2. Listeriosis: The patient has an underlying infection caused by Listeria, which can result in further systemic complications if not effectively treated.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or neurogenic causes. If not properly managed, it can lead to organ perfusion issues and multiple organ failure.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental state is multifactorial and may be attributed to seizures, toxic/metabolic causes, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or a combination of these factors. It is essential to address the underlying causes to prevent further deterioration.
5. Renal failure: The patient is anuric and has experienced difficulties with dialysis due to hypotension. Proper management of renal failure is crucial to prevent further complications.

   -f/u neuro recs
   -f/u EEG
   -stopped phenobarb on [**2134-5-24**]
   -continue dilantin
   -continue treatment for likely listeria meningitis and cerebritis x 6
   weeks

   * Acute oliguric renal failure.
   Thought due to ATN in the setting of hypotension.
   - CVVH today for goal even
   - Renal input appreciated
   * Respiratory failure. Decreased FiO2 to 35%
   - Trach mask as tolerates
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   -trend LFTs, INR, hold spironolactone, MS w/o response to lactulose,
   continue rifaximin
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Now
   stable.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable.
   - Continue to trend
   * DM2: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regular sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH if TFs off

The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis, along with difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's mental status has shown slight improvement as he responds to painful stimuli and has spontaneous eye opening. His temperature is currently at 96.5 degrees Celsius (Axillary). TSH is elevated at 5.0, and FT4 is pending. Cortisol levels are within normal range. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but he may have hypotension due to sepsis or third spacing. He is on treatment for listeria infection and is being weaned off levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50. 

The patient also has acute oliguric renal failure, respiratory failure, and transaminitis with a history of cirrhosis. He is currently receiving CVVH for goal even, tracheostomy mask ventilation, and various medications to manage his conditions. His anemia and thrombocytopenia are stable, and his diabetes mellitus type 2 is being managed with insulin regular sliding scale and held metformin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is now experiencing multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's mental status has shown slight improvement as he responds to painful stimuli and has spontaneous eye opening. He also turns his head towards voices. The patient's seizures have been controlled since 34 days prior. 

Medical Complications:
1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock, likely causing meningitis.
2. Acute oliguric renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of hypotension.
3. Respiratory failure, requiring decreased FiO2 to 35% and tracheostomy.
4. Transaminitis, related to his history of cirrhosis.
5. Anemia, microcytic, likely due to blood loss in the setting of IVF.
6. Thrombocytopenia, stable now but likely from cirrhosis and possibly disseminated intravascular coagulation initially.
7. Diabetes mellitus type 2, with blood sugar levels below 200.
8. Hypothermia, previously present but now stable.
9. Hypotension, possibly related to sepsis/listeria and third spacing.
10. Hypothyroidism, indicated by an"

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is now experiencing multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis, along with difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's mental status has improved slightly, as he responds to painful stimuli and has spontaneous eye opening. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 117/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
2. Meningitis/cerebritis.
3. Difficult-to-control seizures.
4. Acute oliguric renal failure.
5. Hypotension.
6. Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a diagnosis of listeria meningitis and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient's condition has been critical, with limited mental status improvement. He is still critically ill, experiencing multi-organ dysfunction, and currently has hypothermia and rigors. The patient had an aspiration event on 5/21 during a CT scan, and his abdomen/pelvis CT on the same day showed no remarkable findings. He has been afebrile on antibiotics since switching back to ampicillin and bactrim.

The patient's hypotension etiology is unclear, with possible low-grade systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and neurogenic components as well as his anti-epileptic regimen. The plan is to try to wean off norepinephrine (NE) today if the patient's mental status remains stable and mean arterial pressure (MAP) is above 50.

The patient's altered mental status is thought to be multifactorial, including seizures, toxic metabolic, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. There has been some improvement in the patient's mental status today.

The patient has renal failure and did not tolerate hemodialysis (HD) yesterday due to hypotension. He is now back on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient is essentially anuric, with little likelihood of recovery of acute tubular necrosis (AT"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with Listeria meningitis and septic shock who remains critically ill with multi-organ dysfunction. The patient has a poor prognosis and requires ongoing critical care in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia: The patient's current temperature is 34.8°C (94.6°F), indicating hypothermia. This can lead to various complications such as decreased cardiac output, impaired oxygen delivery to tissues, and increased risk of infections.
2. Rigors: The patient experienced rigors, which could be a sign of an infection or sepsis. This increases the risk of further complications like organ failure and poor outcomes.
3. Aspiration event: The patient had an aspiration event during a CT scan. Aspiration can lead to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Listeriosis: The patient has been diagnosed with Listeria meningitis. Incomplete treatment may lead to relapse or persistent infection.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the cause is unclear. Persistent hypotension can result in organ perfusion issues and potential failure.
6. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status due to multifactorial causes. This can increase the risk of falls, aspiration, and other complications related to impaired consciousness.
7. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure, which is not likely to recover. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte im"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with Listeria meningitis and septic shock who is still critically ill. The patient's medical history includes EtOH cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, and a recent aspiration event. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and an altered mental status. The laboratory results indicate abnormalities in electrolyte levels, kidney function, liver function, and cardiac enzymes. The patient's renal function is compromised, and they are currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient also has an infection with Listeria, for which they are being treated with antibiotics.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening septic shock, multiorgan failure, respiratory distress, further decline in mental status, persistent hypotension, and potential cardiovascular collapse. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and ongoing management of the patient's condition will be crucial in preventing and managing these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures.
   * Altered mental status: seems to be improving slightly as he responds
   to painful stimuli and has spontaneous eye opening, also turns head to
   voice.
   -f/u neuro recs
   -f/u EEG
   -stopped phenobarb on [**2134-5-24**]
   -continue dilantin
   -continue treatment for likely listeria meningitis and cerebritis x 6
   weeks
   -repeat MRI for prognostic information likely today, family mtg
   following MRI results for goals of care discussion; if MRI worse, would
   consider LP
   * Seizures: no seizure since [**34**] days prior.
   -continue dilantin, f/u neuro recs, MRI head as above, f/u EEG
   * Hypothermia: hypothermic during day, but no longer overnight. Now
   96.5 Axillary. TSH elevated 5.  FT4 pending. Cortisol WNL x 2.
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u FT4
   * Hypotension: possibly related to sepsis / listeria however on
   treatment for this, also likely component of third spacing, has
   anasarca.
   - wean off levophed to keep MAP>50
   -continue ampicillin/bactrim for listeria
   - monitor lactate
    * Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock.
   Likely c/b meningitis as presented w/ HA and lethargy
   -f/u repeat cultures
   -continue amp / bactrim
   * Acute oliguric renal failure.
   Thought due to ATN in the setting of hypotension.
   - CVVH today for goal even
   - Renal input appreciated
   * Respiratory failure. Decreased FiO2 to 35%
   - Trach mask as tolerates
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   -trend LFTs, INR, hold spironolactone, MS w/o response to lactulose,
   continue rifaximin
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Now
   stable.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable.
   - Continue to trend
   * DM2: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regular sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH if TFs off

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis, along with difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's mental status is improving slightly as he responds to painful stimuli and has spontaneous eye opening. He also turns his head towards voices. The patient has been on phenobarbital, but it was stopped on 05/24/2134. He is currently being treated with dilantin for seizures, and the treatment for likely listeria meningitis and cerebritis will continue for six weeks. An MRI of the head is planned for prognostic information, and a family meeting will be held following the results for goals of care discussion. If the MRI worsens, a lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Listeriosis with bacteremia and septic shock: The patient may experience further complications related to listeriosis, such as meningitis.
2. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress, leading to worsening renal function.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, necessitating increased support or intervention.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes may continue to rise, indicating worsening liver function.
5. Anemia"

The patient is currently on multiple medications including norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and fluconazole. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/48 mmHg to 63/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's arterial line was stopped at 12:52 AM on 05/27/2134 and started again at 12:53 AM on the same day.

The patient's blood cultures from the left arm line tested positive for yeast, leading to the initiation of fluconazole treatment. The patient's arterial line was changed due to suspected line infection. An MRI has been recommended to rule out a listeria abscess. The patient's allergies include nadolol"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis. He presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis, and now has multiorgan system failure with presumed meningitis/cerebritis. The patient also has difficult-to-control seizures and fungemia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 91/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy mask.

The patient has a central venous catheter line that was removed due to fungemia and replaced with an arterial line. He also has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place without drainage.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and renal function. Liver function tests are abnormal with elevated liver enzymes. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Altered mental status: likely secondary to listeriosis, seizures, and new fungemia.
   - MRI today to evaluate for abscess.
   - Follow-up neurologic recommendations.
   - Follow-up final EEG.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with Listeria meningitis and septic shock who is still critically ill. The patient has multi-organ dysfunction and limited mental status improvement. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/48 mmHg to 63/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen line.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including hypothermia and rigors, fungemia (yeast infection in the arterial line), hypotension, altered mental status, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, EtOH cirrhosis, and mechanical ventilation. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, such as fluconazole for the yeast infection, ampicillin for Listeria, bactrim for prophylaxis, regular insulin for glycemic control, and nutrition support through enteral feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fungemia: The patient has developed a yeast infection in the arterial line, which has been treated with fluconazole. There is a risk of further complications if the infection spreads or if the patient does not respond to the treatment.
2. Hypotension:"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with a diagnosis of Listeria meningitis and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient is still critically ill and experiencing limited improvement. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has ongoing hypotension, which could be due to low-grade SIRS, neurogenic components, and the anti-epileptic regimen. It is unclear about the exact etiology of hypotension. 

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to seizures, toxic/metabolic factors, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. However, there has been some improvement in the patient's mental status.

3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing renal failure and did not tolerate hemodialysis (HD) yesterday due to hypotension. The patient is now back on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient is essentially anuric and has a little likelihood of recovery from acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The goal is to continue CVVH with even input/output and off norepinephrine.

4. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and is tolerating tidal volume (TM) well.

5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has cardiomyopathy, and a tran"

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo with Listeria meningitis and septic shock with MODS, still
   critically ill, multi organ dysfunction  and now with limited MS
   improvement
    >Hypothermia and rigors:  Now with fungemia (A line), on Fluconazole
   d1= [**5-26**], awaiting TTE and may need opth eval.
   - clx from CVC and dialysis catheter.
   - Will likely need to change all lines with prophylaxis FFP.
   > Listeriosis: go back to ampicillin (d 1 = [**5-4**], stopped on [**4-26**])
   and bactrim ( d1 =  [**5-10**]). Six week course planned.
   - f/u blood clx
   > Hypotension: likely appears [**1-25**] fungemia.
   - Initially due to Listeria sepsis, with component of cardiogenic shock
   in setting of stress cardiomyopathy.
   -  MAP goal > 50
   - Cortisol was nl last week.
   > Altered mental status thought to be multifactorial (seizures, toxic
   metabolic, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction) now complicated by new
   infection
   - Off phenobarb now on dilantin alone (CVVH dosing), check level on [**5-28**]
    - MRI today.
   - Consider LP
   > Renal failure   Did not tolerate HD yesterday, due to hypotension,
   now back on CVVH
   -  essentially anuric.  Little liklihood of recovery of this ATN
   -  cont  CVVH with goal I/O = even and off NE
   > Mechanical Ventilation: s/p trach on [**5-21**]
   - Tolerating TM well wean FiO2
    >Cardiomyopathy
   - TTE [**5-18**] showed improved function.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with Listeria meningitis and septic shock, now presenting with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient's current medical conditions include hypothermia, rigors, limited MS improvement, hypotension, altered mental status, renal failure, mechanical ventilation, cardiomyopathy, and EtOH cirrhosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Further spread of the fungal infection (yeast) in the arterial line and potential development of candidemia.
2. Progression of sepsis due to Listeria, leading to worsening MODS.
3. Cardiac dysfunction due to cardiomyopathy and stress cardiomyopathy.
4. Renal failure may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not managed appropriately.
5. Persistent altered mental status due to multifactorial causes such as seizures, metabolic imbalances, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction.
6. Development of chronic liver disease or hepatic encephalopathy due to EtOH cirrhosis.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and risk factors associated with critical illness.
9. Nosocomial infections from indwelling lines and catheters.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory"

   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures, now with
   fungemia.
   * Altered mental status:  likely secondary to listeriosis, sz, and now
   new fungemia
   - MRI today to evaluate for ? absccess [**1-25**] listeriosis- f/u MRI read
   - f/u neuro recs
   - EEG w/o seizure activity, only slowing
   - continue dilantin with daily levels (now that he is on fluc)
   -continue treatment for likely listeria meningitis and cerebritis
   - plan for LP pending MRI read and family meeting
   * Fungemia: 1 bottle from a-line
   - f/u culture data, send surveillance cultures
   - TTE w/o significant valvular vegetation or regurgitation, hold off on
   TEE for now as will not change immediate management and less likely
   fungal endocarditis given isolated + blood cultures and no significant
   valvular regurg
   - per ID, fluconazole treatment for now
   - per ophtho no endophthalmitis
   - HD and CVL removed on R, awaiting HD reinsertion for tentatively
   Monday
   * Seizures: no seizure since [**34**] days prior.
   -continue dilantin
   - f/u neuro recs
   - MRI head as above
   - f/u EEG
   * Hypotension: possibly related to sepsis / listeria however on
   treatment for this, also likely component of third spacing, has
   anasarca. Also now with fungemia
   - wean off levophed to keep MAP>50
   -continue ampicillin/bactrim for listeria
   - monitor lactate
   * Acute oliguric renal failure.
   Thought due to ATN in the setting of hypotension, still no UOP.
   - d/c HD line today due to fungemia
   * Respiratory failure.
   - switch to trach collar when sedation weaned (on propofol temporarily
   for procedures)
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   -trend LFTs, INR, hold spironolactone, MS w/o response to lactulose,
   continue rifaximin
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.  Drop from admission in setting of IVF. Now
   stable.
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21
   * Thrombocytopenia: Now stable, Likely from cirrhosis.  ? from DIC
   initially.  Stable.
   - Continue to trend
   * DM2: BS < 200
   - Hold home metformin
   - Insulin regular sliding scale, goal glucose <150. hold NPH if TFs off

The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, difficult-to-control seizures, and fungemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: This could be due to listeriosis, seizures, and new fungemia.
2. Fungemia: The patient has a fungal infection in his bloodstream, which requires treatment and further investigation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to sepsis, listeria infection, third spacing, and anasarca.
4. Acute oliguric renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute kidney injury, possibly due to hypotension and acute tubular necrosis.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient requires respiratory support and may need tracheostomy collar when sedation is weaned.
6. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be related to his history of cirrhosis.
7. Anemia: The patient has a drop in hematocrit levels, possibly due to intravenous fluid administration.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, likely due to cirrhosis and possibly disseminated intravascular coagulation.

   new fungemia
   - MRI today to evaluate for ? absccess [**1-25**] listeriosis
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u final EEG
   - continue dilantin with daily levels (now that he is on fluc)
   -continue treatment for likely listeria meningitis and cerebritis x 6
   weeks
   - will do LP today with FFP prior
   * Fungemia: 1 bottle from a-line
   - f/u culture data
   - f/u echo
   - per ID, fluconazole treatment for now
   - consult ophtho
   - culture CVL and HD line, will pull HD line and replace CVL today

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient also has fungemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis/Cerebritis: The patient's altered mental status could be a result of listeriosis leading to meningitis and cerebritis. MRI and follow-up neurological recommendations are needed to evaluate for abscesses.
2. Fungemia: The patient has a fungal infection in the bloodstream. Continuous monitoring of cultures and treatment with fluconazole is recommended.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be related to sepsis/listeria or third spacing due to anasarca. Weaning off levophed and monitoring mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 50 is advised.
4. Acute Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis in the setting of hypotension. Renal recommendations include discontinuing the infected hemodialysis (HD) line, holding continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and consulting with the renal team.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires careful monitoring of oxygen saturation levels, and FiO2 adjustment is necessary. Tracheostomy"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient remains critically ill with limited mental status improvement. The patient's hypothermia and rigors are now attributed to fungemia, and they are on Fluconazole. The patient previously had listeriosis treated with ampicillin and bactrim, and a six-week course is planned. Hypotension is likely due to fungemia and initially caused by Listeria sepsis, with a component of cardiogenic shock in the setting of stress cardiomyopathy. The goal MAP is above 50, and cortisol levels were normal last week.

The patient's altered mental status is thought to be multifactorial, including seizures, toxic metabolic, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and now complicated by a new infection with no improvement in mental status. The MRI read is pending, and consideration for a lumbar puncture (LP) based on the MRI read will be made. Renal failure is present, and dialysis breaks are given due to the removal of the catheter. The patient is mechanically ventilated and tolerating tracheostomy well, with plans to wean FiO2 when sedation from the MRI wears off.

Cardiomyopathy has shown improved function on trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE), but biventricular function was normal on [**5-27**"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient is still critically ill and has limited mental status improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypothermia and rigors: The patient experienced hypothermia and rigors, which may be related to the fungemia. Monitoring for any signs of fever or infection is important.

2. Listeriosis: The patient had listeriosis, for which he was treated with ampicillin and bactrim. Long-term follow-up blood cultures will be necessary to ensure eradication of the infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to fungemia. Maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50 is crucial. Cortisol levels should be monitored regularly.

4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is thought to be multifactorial, including seizures, toxic metabolic, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and a new infection. An MRI read is pending, and consideration for a lumbar puncture (LP) based on the MRI read is necessary.

5. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure, and dialysis breaks are given due to the removal of the catheter. CVVH dosing should be adjusted accordingly.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who has been diagnosed with Listeria meningitis and septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently critically ill and experiencing limited improvement. The patient has several medical complications, including hypothermia and rigors, fungemia, hypotension, altered mental status, renal failure, mechanical ventilation, cardiomyopathy, and cirrhosis of the liver due to chronic alcohol use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia and rigors: The patient's body temperature is currently within normal range, but there is a risk of further hypothermia due to his critical condition. Rigors may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.
2. Fungemia: The patient has developed a fungal infection, likely due to the presence of a central venous catheter. Treatment with fluconazole has been initiated.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or fungemia. Maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50 is a goal to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors such as seizures, metabolic abnormalities, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and a new infection. An MRI has been ordered, and consideration is being given to performing a lumbar puncture.
5. Renal failure: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multi-organ system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis, along with difficult-to-control seizures. The patient also has fungemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to listeriosis (listeria meningitis and cerebritis) and fungemia.
2. Fungemia: The patient has fungemia, which requires continued monitoring of cultures and surveillance cultures.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to sepsis/listeria or third spacing, possibly due to anasarca.
4. Acute anuric renal failure: The patient has acute anuric renal failure, possibly due to hypotension and not recovering. CVVH is planned for reinsertion on Monday unless urgently needed over the weekend.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is tolerating the trach collar well, and weaning of O2 is planned as tolerated.
6. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which is expected given his history of cirrhosis.
7. Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia, and transfusion is recommended for HCT < 21.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient has limited mental status improvement. The patient's condition is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothermia and rigors: The patient may develop hypothermia and rigors due to fungemia. Fluconazole is being administered to treat the fungal infection.
2. Listeriosis: The patient has listeriosis, which requires a six-week course of treatment with ampicillin and bactrim.
3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has high stool output, which raises the possibility of C. diff infection. Further testing is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to Listeria sepsis and cardiogenic shock in the setting of stress cardiomyopathy. Maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal of >50 is important.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial and may be caused by seizures, toxic metabolic, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or a new infection. Cortisol levels were normal last week, and Dilantin dosage needs to be monitored.
6. Renal failure: The patient has anuria with little potential for recovery of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). CVVH (continuous"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient's condition is critical, and there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, likely due to Listeria sepsis and cardiogenic shock in the setting of stress cardiomyopathy. The MAP goal is set at >50, and cortisol levels were normal last week.

2. Altered mental status: The patient is presenting with altered mental status, which is believed to be multifactorial. It may be caused by seizures, toxic metabolic conditions, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or a new infection. There has been no improvement in mental status (MS) after treatment.

3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing renal failure, and dialysis breaks have been given due to the removal of the CVVH catheter. The patient is essentially anuric, with little potential for recovery of this acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

4. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy (TM). FiO2 will be weaned when sedation from the MRI wears off.

5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has shown improvement in cardiac function on a transthoracic echocardi"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. The note mentions several conditions and interventions:

1. Seizure with status epilepticus: The patient had a seizure and was given 4mg IV ativan to respond to it. The patient is still having generalized seizures.

2. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient's mental status is altered, but it is not specified as delirium.

3. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient has pneumonia due to aspiration, which could be a result of their altered mental status.

4. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is below normal, indicating hypothermia.

5. Ineffective coping: The patient's ability to cope with their condition is ineffective.

6. Meningitis, bacterial: There were attempts to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) to diagnose bacterial meningitis. However, the LP was unsuccessful due to excessive bleeding. The patient received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to the procedure and 4 units afterwards. They also received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

7. Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI): There is no specific evidence provided in the note for this condition.

8. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient appears to have severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, given the presence of hypotension and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. The patient now has multi-organ system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis, as well as difficult-to-control seizures. Additionally, the patient has developed fungemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 107/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals rhonchi in the right lower lung field, slightly tense abdomen with no masses or organomegaly, and widespread edema bilaterally. Neurological examination is not possible due to the patient being intubated.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, platelet count, lactate levels, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests. Imaging studies show abscesses on [Year 6894].

The assessment and plan for the patient include:
1. Altered mental status/seizures: likely secondary to listeriosis (listeria meningitis and cerebritis) and fungemia. Abscesses seen on imaging. Attempted lumbar puncture yesterday. Can attempt LP today (at"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The note details the patient's health progress over time and outlines various assessments, treatments, and potential medical complications.

The patient has a history of seizure activity, with a recent episode of generalized seizure that responded to lorazepam. There is also a mention of altered mental status, which is not delirium. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia due to aspiration, hypothermia, ineffective coping, bacterial meningitis, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and other fungal infection.

In terms of interventions, the patient has received multiple blood transfusions, antibiotics (Bactrim, fluconazole, and ampicillin), and various medications such as norepinephrine, heparin sodium, lorazepam, and lansoprazole. The patient's vital signs are being closely monitored, and they are on mechanical ventilation support with a tracheostomy.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. There are also indications of renal dysfunction and elevated cardiac markers.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, with multiple organ dysfunctions and infections. Immediate attention should be focused on stabilizing the patient's vital signs, managing sepsis, addressing respiratory and renal failures"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is now experiencing multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis, as well as difficult-to-control seizures. The patient also has fungemia, which is being treated with fluconazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status/seizures: The patient's altered mental status and seizures are likely secondary to listeriosis (listeria meningitis and cerebritis) and fungemia. This condition can lead to further neurological complications if not properly managed.
2. Fungemia: The patient has fungemia, which means there is an infection caused by a fungal organism in the blood. This can lead to systemic infection and organ damage if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to sepsis/listeria, third spacing, or anasarca. It is important to continue treating the underlying infections and monitor the patient's blood pressure closely to prevent hypoperfusion and organ failure.
4. Acute anuric renal failure: The patient has acute anuric renal failure, which means he has lost the ability to produce urine and his kidneys are not functioning properly. This can be due to hypotension and/or sepsis. CVVH (continuous veno-ven"

- The patient has multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and limited mental status improvement.
- There have been recurrent seizures despite therapeutic dilantin levels.
- The patient has hypothermia and rigors, likely due to fungemia (catheter-related infection).
- The patient is being treated with fluconazole and surveillance cultures are being obtained.
- The patient has a history of listeriosis and is on a six-week course of ampicillin and bactrim.
- There is a question of Clostridium difficile infection versus tube feeds.
- The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to fungemia and a drop in hemoglobin levels.
- The patient has anemia and received 2 units of packed red blood cells, but showed an inappropriate response.
- The patient has altered mental status, which is thought to be multifactorial.
- There is concern for a new infection with abscess and continued cerebritis.
- Additional EEG is needed.
- The patient's renal function has failed, and dialysis will be resumed.
- The patient is mechanically ventilated and has a new right-sided infiltrate, possibly due to aspiration during a seizure.
- Cardiomyopathy is present, but there is improvement in left ventricular function.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock. He has multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and limited mental status improvement. The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing issues including hypothermia and rigors due to fungemia, listeriosis, high stool output, hypotension, altered mental status, renal failure, mechanical ventilation, cardiomyopathy, and EtOH cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates a potential risk of inadequate organ perfusion and shock.
2. Renal failure: The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels suggest renal dysfunction, which may progress to acute kidney injury.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's unresponsiveness and non-purposeful movements could indicate a severe infection or metabolic imbalance.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's history of stress cardiomyopathy and impaired left ventricular function increases the risk of cardiac complications.
5. Fungemia and Listeriosis: The presence of fungemia and listeriosis suggests a high risk of further infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
6. Septic shock: The patient's initial presentation of septic shock indicates a critical illness with a high risk of mortality.
7. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's MODS implies the involvement of multiple organ systems, increasing the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He remains critically ill with limited mental status improvement and recurrent seizures despite therapeutic levels of dilantin. 

The patient's current conditions include hypothermia and rigors due to fungemia, listeriosis, high stool output possibly due to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) or tube feeds, hypotension likely caused by fungemia and slow drop in hemoglobin, anemia with inappropriate response to packed red blood cell transfusion, altered mental status attributed to seizures, toxic metabolic, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction, and renal failure requiring dialysis. 

The patient is mechanically ventilated and has developed a new right-sided infiltrate, suggestive of aspiration during a seizure. He also has cardiomyopathy with improved function on TTE, etoh cirrhosis, and is being treated for suspected C. diff infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemolytic process: The patient's recent increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels raises suspicion of a hemolytic process. Further investigation is needed, including a peripheral smear prior to transfusion. The patient's Hct goal should be maintained above 25, and guiac stool should be checked. Transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) is recommended. Serial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis. He presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, difficult-to-control seizures, and fungemia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/55 mmHg to 159/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has a central venous pressure of 24 mmHg and is receiving fluids and blood products. He is also receiving medications such as phenytoin, vancomycin, meropenem, and fluconazole. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. His electrolytes and blood glucose levels are also abnormal. The patient's imaging shows evidence of abscesses on MRI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis/Cerebritis: The patient's altered mental status, seizures, and MRI findings suggest meningitis/cerebritis. This condition can lead to further neurological deterioration if not appropriately managed.
2. Fungemia: The patient has fungemia, indicated by fungal"

   fungemia.
   * Altered mental status/seizures:  likely secondary to listeriosis
   (listeria meningitis and cerebritis) and fungemia. Abscesses seen on
   MRI.  Attempted LP yesterday.
   - can attempt LP today (at bedside vs. IR)
   - f/u neuro recs in light of new seizure and ? phenobarb resuming
   - continue amp/bactrim for listeria
   - continue fluconazole for fungemia
   - repeat EEG
   - if seizes, check FS
   * Fungemia: all lines growing fungus
   -continue to f/u cultures, surveillance cultures
   - per ID, fluconazole treatment for now
   - per ophtho no endophthalmitis
   - HD and CVL removed on R, awaiting HD reinsertion for tentatively
   Monday
   - if continues to grow fungal cx, will need TEE
   * Respiratory failure: CXR appears that pt may have aspirated this AM
   during sz like activity
   - daily CXR
   - sputum sample
   - broaden coverage for vancomycin
   - attempt PS and check gas
   * Anemia:  Microcytic.
   -  3 PM Hct
   - add on hemolysis labs, peripheral smear
   - guiaic stools
   - transfuse 2 pRBCs
   * Hypotension: possibly related to sepsis / listeria however on
   treatment for this, also likely component of third spacing, has
   anasarca.
   -continue levophed, wean as tolerated, MAP goal > 50mmHg
   -continue to treat above infections
   * Acute anuric renal failure:
   -ATN in setting of hypotension, however, not recovering
   -CVVH, currently on hold given lack of HD line for line holiday, plan
   to reinsert Monday unless urgently needed over the weekend
   * Transaminitis with history of cirrhosis.
   -trend LFTs, INR, hold spironolactone, MS w/o response to lactulose,
   continue rifaximin

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to an outside hospital (OSH) in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is now experiencing multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient also has fungemia.

The patient's medical conditions include altered mental status/seizures, likely secondary to listeriosis and fungemia. Abscesses have been seen on MRI. An attempted lumbar puncture (LP) yesterday was unsuccessful, and an interventional radiology (IR) guided LP is planned. The patient has been given an extra dose of phenytoin for seizure control. An EEG has not been completed yet. The patient's ID team recommends discontinuing ampicillin and starting meropenem. Culture data is still negative for new bacterial growth, and the sputum culture is pending with signs of yeast infection. Vancomycin has been started.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as there may have been aspiration during seizure activity. Daily chest X-rays will be done, and a sputum sample will be collected. Broadening coverage with vancomycin is planned. The patient has anemia with a low hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and a transfusion of 2 packed red blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is now experiencing multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, difficult-to-control seizures, and fungemia. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including altered mental status/seizures, respiratory failure with possible aspiration, anemia, hypotension, acute anuric renal failure, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status/seizures: The patient is experiencing seizures and altered mental status, likely secondary to listeriosis (listeria meningitis and cerebritis) and fungemia. There is a potential for further deterioration in neurological function.
2. Fungemia: The patient has been diagnosed with fungemia, and there is a risk of ongoing fungal infection. Continuous monitoring and surveillance cultures are necessary to guide treatment decisions.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient may have aspirated during seizure activity, leading to respiratory failure. Daily chest X-rays and sputum samples should be obtained to monitor for worsening respiratory status. Broadening antibiotic coverage with vancomycin may be considered.
4. Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia, which could be due to chronic disease or gastrointestinal blood loss"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient's culture data is still negative for new bacterial growth, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The patient has been prescribed multiple antibiotics, including ampicillin, vancomycin, and meropenem, which suggests a severe infection. The presence of yeast in the sputum culture also indicates a potential fungal infection.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a tracheostomy tube, indicating severe respiratory distress. The ventilator settings show an increased peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and plateau pressure, suggesting possible lung injury or inadequate ventilation. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is low, indicating hypoxemia.

3. Cardiovascular problems: The patient's blood pressure is low, with frequent hypotensive episodes requiring norepinephrine infusion. The heart rate is within normal limits, but there is no information provided about the patient's cardiac rhythm other than it being sinus rhythm.

4. Renal impairment: The serum creatinine levels have progressively increased, indicating a decline in renal function. This could be due to sepsis, nephrotoxic drugs, or the patient's underlying medical conditions.

5. Coagulation disorder: The elevated PT/INR and PTT suggest a coagulation disorder, which may be related to disseminated intr"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing ongoing hypotension, which may be related to septic shock. It is important to monitor and manage blood pressure to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

2. Fungemia: The patient has been diagnosed with fungemia, likely due to Candida species. Fluconazole has been initiated for treatment, but close monitoring of blood cultures is necessary to assess response to therapy.

3. Listeriosis: The patient has a history of listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes. A prolonged course of ampicillin and bactrim is planned to eradicate the infection.

4. Anemia: The patient has received multiple blood transfusions but shows an inadequate response. Further evaluation, including a peripheral smear and additional HCT checks, is needed to determine the cause of the anemia.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors such as seizures, metabolic abnormalities, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and possibly a new central nervous system infection. An additional EEG and repeat attempts at lumbar puncture under interventional radiology guidance are necessary for further evaluation.

6. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing renal failure, with anuria and little potential for recovery of acute tubular necrosis. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltr"

   drop in Hct [**5-29**], and probably some element of  SIRS from aspiration
   event on [**5-29**], slowly improving.
   -  MAP goal > 60, supportive with NE
   > Anemia: received a total of 2U PRBC (with inappropriate response
   [**5-29**]). Only recent procedure is LP attempt (with no evidence of
   hematoma). No obvious hemolytic source.
   - Check peripheral smear (prior to transfusion)
   - Hct goal > 25
   - guiac stool
   - transfuse 2UPRBC
   - serial HCT checks

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual diagnosed with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient's condition remains critically ill with limited mental status improvement and recurrent seizures despite being on therapeutic Dilantin.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with Listeria meningitis and fungemia. There is a risk of further infections due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.

2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient is experiencing MODS, which involves dysfunction of multiple organs such as the respiratory system, renal system, hepatic system, and cardiovascular system. These organ dysfunctions require careful monitoring and management.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. This could be due to chronic blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be related to septic shock and underlying cardiac dysfunction. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate hemodynamic support are essential.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors such as seizures, toxic/metabolic effects, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. Ongoing assessment and intervention are necessary to improve mental status and prevent"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old individual with a diagnosis of Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). They are still critically ill and experiencing limited mental status improvement along with recurrent seizures despite being on therapeutic dilantin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fungemia: The patient has a history of fungemia, and there is a risk of recurrence. Continuous surveillance cultures will be done, and fluconazole treatment will be continued.
2. Listeriosis: The patient has listeriosis, for which they were initially treated with ampicillin but stopped on 04/26. They were then restarted on ampicillin from 05/23 until 05/30. Bactrim will be given for six weeks, and meropenem will provide additional coverage for both listeria and aspiration.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to fungemia and may also be related to the slow drop in hematocrit (Hct) and an element of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) from the aspiration event on 05/29. Supportive treatment with norepinephrine (NE) will be provided to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
4. Anemia: The patient has received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but has shown an inappropriate response. No obvious"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
- The patient has limited mental status improvement and recurrent seizures despite being on therapeutic dilantin.
- Fungemia is present with positive blood cultures from a central venous catheter (CVC) and hemodialysis (HD) line tips, despite negative blood cultures.
- Listeriosis is being treated with ampicillin and bactrim for a six-week course, and meropenem has been added for both listeria and aspiration coverage.
- The patient's hypotension is likely due to fungemia, slow drop in hematocrit (Hct), and an element of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) from aspiration.
- Anemia is present with a stable Hct after receiving two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
- Altered mental status is thought to be multifactorial and complicated by new infection with no improvement in mental status.
- Additional EEG is needed to determine the cause of seizures.
- Renal failure has occurred with essentially anuric renal function and little potential for recovery of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- Respiratory failure is present with right-sided infiltrate in the setting of aspiration during a seizure.
- Cardiomyopathy has shown improved function on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with a diagnosis of Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient remains critically ill with limited mental status improvement and recurrent seizures despite being on therapeutic dilantin.

The patient's medical history includes EtOH cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, anemia, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and renal failure. The patient has undergone several interventions including lumbar puncture, dialysis catheter insertion, removal of central venous catheters, tracheostomy, and administration of multiple antibiotics.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/60 to 90/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and central venous pressure of 20 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,683 mL and output of 2,006 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal bibasilar opacities on chest X-ray and the presence of a subclavian catheter line infection. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slightly bloody, xanthochromic fluid with elevated white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   76yo with Listeria meningitis, fungemia  and septic shock with MODS,
   still critically ill, multi organ dysfunction  and now with limited MS
   improvement and recurrent seizures on therapeutic dilantin on [**5-30**].
   >Fungemia:  fungemia (A line clx and tip), on Fluconazole d1= [**5-26**], neg
   TTE and neg opth eval..
   - removed CVC and HD cath (both line tips were positive), although
   blood clx were neg to date, new positive  blood cultures would be an
   indication for TEE.
   - cont Fluconazole. D1= [**5-26**]
   - surveillance clx from mycolytic
   - TEE on hold given varices
   > Listeriosis:   ampicillin (d 1 = [**5-4**], stopped on [**4-26**] then
   restarted [**5-23**] and stopped [**5-30**]) and bactrim ( d1 =  [**5-10**]). Six week
   course planned.  Meropenem as additional coverage [**5-30**] (for both
   listeria and aspiration)
   - f/u blood clx
   - Will need LP under IR.
   - check to ensure HIV testing completed
     > Hypotension: likely appears [**1-25**] fungemia now complicated by slow
   drop in Hct [**5-29**], and probably some element of  SIRS from aspiration
   event on [**5-29**], slowly improving.
   -  MAP goal > 60, supportive with NE
   > Anemia: received a total of 2U PRBC (with inappropriate response
   [**5-29**]). Only recent procedure is LP attempt (with no evidence of
   hematoma). No obvious hemolytic source.
   - Check peripheral smear (prior to transfusion)
   - Hct goal > 25
   - guiac stool
   - transfuse 2UPRBC
   - serial HCT checks
   > Altered mental status thought to be multifactorial (seizures, toxic
   metabolic, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction) now complicated by new
   infection with no improvement in MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 6894**] demonstrating abscess and
   cont cerebritis and  [**5-29**] with new seizures.  ? Whether there is a
   source we are not treating and whether we need to add phenobarb back.
   Will need an additional EEG
   - Dilantin alone, with additional dose given [**5-30**]
   - LP under IR today.
   - Repeat EEG
   - Neuro rec
   > Renal failure : dialysis break given the removal of the HD catheter
   -  essentially anuric.  Little potential for recovery of this ATN
   - break from  CVVH, with plan for line [**5-31**]
    > Respiratory failure: s/p trach on [**5-7**] with new right sided
   infiltrate in the setting of aspiration during a seizure.
   - Would change to PS ventilation if possible, if not decrease rate.
   - Obtain sputum sample
   - Cont Vanco (D1=[**5-30**]) and Meropenem (D1=[**5-30**]) for 8 day course if neg
   sputum.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old individual with multiple medical conditions including Listeria meningitis, fungemia, septic shock with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), limited mental status improvement, and recurrent seizures despite being on therapeutic dilantin.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Fungemia: The patient has ongoing fungemia, which is indicated by positive blood cultures from the central venous catheter (CVC) and hemodialysis (HD) catheter. Fluconazole has been prescribed for treatment, and surveillance cultures are being monitored. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been recommended but is currently on hold due to varices.

2. Listeriosis: The patient has been treated with ampicillin for listeriosis, but it was stopped on [**4-26**] and restarted on [**5-23**]. However, it was again stopped on [**5-30**]. Bactrim has also been given as additional coverage for a planned six-week course. Meropenem has been added as additional coverage for both listeriosis and aspiration.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to fungemia and complications from an aspiration event on [**5-29**]. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60, and norepinephrine is being used for supportive measures.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multi-organ system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. He also has fungemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status/seizures: The patient's mental status has not improved today, and there is a possibility of non-convulsive status epilepticus. An EEG should be followed up, and the free dilantin level should be checked. Neurology and infectious disease consultations are recommended for the elevated CSF protein, which may be related to the previous infection. Fluc (fluconazole), bactrim, and meropenem should be continued. If the patient seizes, a full seizure workup should be done.

2. Fungemia: All lines are growing fungus, so cultures should be followed up. Treatment with fluconazole should be initiated. The transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) should be held due to the presence of varices.

3. Respiratory failure: Focal opacities of the right lower lobe (RLL) likely related to aspiration in the setting of a seizure were observed. Meropenem should be continued for five days and then switched to ampicillin. An attempt should be made to wean ventilator settings"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient also has fungemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status/seizures: There has been no improvement in mental status, possibly non-convulsive status epilepticus. The patient's EEG should be followed up, and free dilantin level and dosing should be reviewed. Neurology and ID consultation should be sought to evaluate elevated CSF protein. Fluc (fluconazole), [Last Name (un)], and bactrim should continue. If the patient seizes, a full seizure workup (FS) should be performed.

2. Fungemia: All lines are growing fungus. Cultures should be followed up, and treatment with fluconazole should be initiated. Thoroughly evaluate the patient for other sources of infection.

3. Respiratory failure: Focal opacities of RLL likely related to aspiration in the setting of seizure. Continue meropenem for 5 days and then switch to ampicillin. Attempt to wean vent settings to PSV (pressure support ventilation).

4. Anemia: Trend daily and evaluate the cause of microcytic anemia.

5. Hypotension: Attempt to wean"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock likely secondary to listeriosis. The patient is now experiencing multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis with difficult-to-control seizures. The patient also has fungemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Altered mental status/seizures: The patient's mental status has not improved, possibly indicating non-convulsive status epilepticus. Further evaluation with an EEG is recommended, along with monitoring free dilantin levels and adjusting neurologic dosing.
2. Fungemia: All lines are growing fungus, indicating a potential bloodstream infection. Cultures should be followed, and treatment with fluconazole should be continued.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has focal opacities of the right lower lobe likely related to aspiration during a seizure. Continuing meropenem for five days and then switching to ampicillin, as well as continuing vancomycin, is advised. Attempting to wean vent settings to pressure support ventilation (PSV) may also be considered.
4. Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia, which should be trended daily.
5. Hypotension: Efforts should be made to wean pressors while keeping mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. It is unclear if"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaints include a posterior anal fissure, low dilantin levels, and a history of palpitations. 

The patient underwent a colonoscopy and was diagnosed with a posterior anal fissure. To manage this, the patient is advised to keep the stool soft, avoid rectal tube use, and apply topical nitroglycerin as needed. A bag has been placed on the rectum to prevent decubitus ulcers.

The patient's dilantin level remained low, so 500 mg of IV dilantin was given and tolerated well. The plan is to recheck the levels in the morning.

The patient's post-transfusion hematocrit (HCT) is stable, and Lantus insulin dosage has been decreased due to low blood sugar levels.

The patient has allergies to nadolol, propranolol, and lidocaine Hcl/epinephrine.

The patient has received various antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, fluconazole, and Bactrim (SMX/TMP).

The patient is currently on infusions of norepinephrine and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include nutrition through Nutren Renal (full), glycemic control measures, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

   IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video-EEG because of
   moderate diffuse background slowing, absent posterior dominant rhythm,
   brief periods of diffuse background attenuation, and frequent bursts of
   frontally maximal triphasic waves. These findings are indicative of
   moderate diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
   nonspecific. Triphasic waves are commonly seen in metabolic
   encephalopathies. There are no electrographic seizures.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient remains critically ill with limited mental status improvement and recurrent seizures despite therapeutic dilantin. The patient has a history of EtOH cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, and altered mental status thought to be multifactorial.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to fungemia, septic shock, and possibly some element of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) from aspiration.
2. Anemia: The patient received a total of 2U PRBC with an inappropriate response. The goal is to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) level above 25. Guaiac stool and serial HCT checks should be done.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to seizures, toxic or metabolic factors, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, or a new infection with cerebral involvement. An additional dose of phenobarbital may be considered.
4. Renal failure: The patient is essentially anuric and has little potential for recovery of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). CVVH should be restarted and run even to slightly net negative.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has a new right-sided infiltrate in the setting of aspiration during a seizure. Weaning down to"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock who remains critically ill in the ICU. He has multiple organ dysfunction and limited mental status improvement, along with recurrent seizures despite being on therapeutic dilantin. The patient's condition is complicated by anemia, altered mental status, renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy, and etOH cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of Listeria meningitis and fungemia. There is a risk of developing new infections due to the removal of central venous catheters and hemodialysis catheters. Surveillance cultures are being performed to monitor for any new infections.

2. Anemia: The patient has received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with an inappropriate response. It is important to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels closely and consider further transfusions if necessary.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is multifactorial, including seizures, toxic-metabolic causes, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. The ongoing infection and abscess formation may also contribute to his altered mental status. EEG results show evidence of seizure activity, but the source of the seizures is unclear. Further evaluation, such as adding phenobarbital, may be needed.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has anuria and is essentially in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is critically ill and has limited mental status improvement with recurrent seizures despite being on therapeutic Dilantin. The patient has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed, including fungemia, listeriosis, hypotension, anemia, altered mental status, renal failure, respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy, and etoh cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fungemia: The patient has ongoing fungemia caused by Candida species. It is important to continue antifungal therapy with fluconazole and monitor for any new positive blood cultures.
2. Listeriosis: The patient has listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes. Treatment with ampicillin has been initiated, but it was stopped previously and restarted recently. The plan is to complete a six-week course of ampicillin. Meropenem has been added for additional coverage against both Listeria and aspiration.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to fungemia and septic shock. Pressor support with norepinephrine is being provided to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
4. Anemia: The patient has received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but had an inappropriate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis. He presented to an outside hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis, and now has multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis. The patient also has difficult-to-control seizures and fungemia. 

The patient's current conditions include altered mental status/seizures, respiratory failure, anemia, hypotension, hypothermia, acute anuric renal failure, cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus type 2. 

The medical team's assessment and plan include monitoring dilantin levels, continuing fluc, bactrim, and if the patient seizes, checking the full seizure report. They also plan to follow up with cultures and treat with fluconazole. In terms of respiratory failure, they will continue meropenem for five days and then switch to ampicillin, while discontinuing vancomycin. 

For anemia, they will trend daily. Hypotension will be managed by attempting to wean pressors and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60. Hypothermia will be monitored by measuring temperature rectally. Acute anuric renal failure will be treated with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and the goal will be to maintain even I/O. 

Cirrhosis management includes lactulose and rifaximin, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is now experiencing multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient has also been diagnosed with fungemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status/seizures: The patient's mental status has not improved today, and there is a possibility of non-convulsive status epilepticus. An EEG is recommended to further evaluate this condition. The free dilantin level should be followed up, and the neurology team should review the dilantin dosing. It is also important to check for focal seizures if they occur.

2. Fungemia: All lines are growing fungus, indicating a fungal infection. Cultures should be followed up, and treatment with fluconazole should be initiated.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has focal opacities in the right lower lobe likely related to aspiration during a seizure. The current antibiotic regimen with meropenem should be continued for five days before switching to ampicillin. Vancomycin should also be continued, and an attempt should be made to wean the ventilator settings to pressure support ventilation (PSV).

4. Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia, and daily trends should be monitored.

5. Hypotension: The"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a diagnosis of Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient is still critically ill and experiencing limited improvement, recurrent seizures despite therapeutic dilantin levels, and hypothermia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension likely due to fungemia and complications such as slow drop in hematocrit and possible elements of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) from aspiration. Pressor requirement continues, indicating ongoing hypotension.

2. Anemia: The patient has received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but showed an inappropriate response. The goal hematocrit (Hct) is above 25, suggesting the need for further transfusion or other interventions to improve the patient's anemia.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is thought to be multifactorial, including seizures, toxic/metabolic factors, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. The recent infection and lack of improvement in mental status raise concerns about whether there is an untreated source of infection or the need to add phenobarbital back for seizure control.

4. Renal failure: The patient is essentially anuric and has shown little potential for recovery of acute tubular necrosis (ATN"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient is critically ill and experiencing limited mental status improvement and recurrent seizures despite being on therapeutic dilantin.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, anemia, altered mental status, renal failure, respiratory failure, cardiomyopathy, and cirrhosis. The patient has undergone several interventions including removal of central venous catheters (CVC), hemodialysis (HD) catheter, tracheostomy, and has been receiving various medications such as ampicillin, bactrim, fluconazole, meropenem, and rifaximin.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic shock and may continue to require pressor support. Monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) is important to ensure adequate perfusion.

2. Anemia: The patient has received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but showed an inappropriate response. The goal hematocrit (Hct) is above 25. Further transfusions may be required based on the patient's oxygen carrying capacity and tissue perfusion.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, involving seizures, toxic metabolic"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient remains critically ill with limited mental status improvement and recurrent seizures despite therapeutic dilantin levels. 

The patient has a history of EtOH cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, and recent aspiration event. He is currently on multiple medications including fluconazole, meropenem, ampicillin, bactrim, and norepinephrine for hypotension. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's physical examination shows scleral icterus, jaundice, crackles in the chest, soft non-tender abdomen, distended extremities, and muscle wasting. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 111 K/uL, elevated creatinine at 2.4 mg/dL, and liver enzyme abnormalities with alanine transaminase (ALT) at 47 U/L and aspartate transaminase (AST) at 111 U/L. 

The patient's neurological status is described as non-attentive,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He is now experiencing multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient also has fungemia and respiratory failure with focal opacities in the right lower lobe likely related to aspiration during a seizure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status/seizures: The patient's mental status has been waxing and waning, and he continues to experience seizures. Dilantin levels should be monitored, and if seizures occur, a full seizure workup should be performed.
2. Fungemia: All lines are growing fungus, indicating a possible bloodstream infection. Cultures should be monitored, and treatment with fluconazole should be continued.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there are focal opacities in the right lower lobe likely due to aspiration during a seizure. The plan is to switch to ampicillin, continue with bactrim, discontinue meropenem and vancomycin, and follow arterial blood gas (ABG) trends.
4. Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia, which should be trended daily and monitored for stability.
5. Eosinophilia: The patient has an absolute eosinophil count of 500, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. He also has fungemia. The patient's altered mental status/seizures, respiratory failure, anemia, hypotension, hypothermia, acute anuric renal failure, cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus type 2 are being monitored and treated accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Seizure control: The patient's seizures are difficult to control, indicating a potential risk of further seizures and associated complications.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including listeriosis, fungemia, and possible meningitis/cerebritis. These infections can lead to worsening sepsis and multiorgan system failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient is experiencing an acute anuric renal failure, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to septic shock or other underlying conditions. If not managed properly, it can result in organ perfusion failure.
6. Hypothermia: The patient's hypothermia needs to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the emergency department in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. The patient now has multiorgan system failure and presumed meningitis/cerebritis, along with difficult-to-control seizures. He also has fungemia.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Altered mental status/seizures: The patient has waxing and waning mental status and is experiencing seizures. Dilantin levels should be monitored, and the neurologist will determine the appropriate dosing.

2. Fungemia: All lines are growing fungus, so cultures will be followed, and treatment with fluconazole will continue.

3. Respiratory failure: There are focal opacities of the right lower lobe likely related to aspiration during a seizure. Meropenem will be continued for five days before switching to ampicillin. Vancomycin will be discontinued.

4. Anemia: The patient has microcytic anemia, and it should be trended daily.

5. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, and attempts will be made to wean the pressors while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. It is unclear if the hypotension is related to fungemia and listeria.

6. Hypothermia: Temperature will be measured rectally.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a diagnosis of Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock with multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient remains critically ill and has limited mental status improvement. He also experiences recurrent seizures despite being on therapeutic dilantin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to have hypotension requiring increasing pressor support. This may indicate ongoing septic shock or other underlying conditions such as cardiac dysfunction.
2. Fungemia: The patient has a positive fungal blood culture, indicating ongoing fungal infection. Appropriate antifungal therapy is being administered, but the patient remains at risk for further complications related to fungemia.
3. Listeriosis: The patient has been treated with ampicillin for listeriosis, but the treatment has been interrupted multiple times. The patient is currently off ampicillin and being treated with meropenem, which raises concern for the effectiveness of treating the underlying infection.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, indicating anemia. Blood transfusions have been given, but the response has been inadequate. The patient's goal hemoglobin concentration should be maintained above 25.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered due to a combination of factors including seizures, toxic metabolic effects, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. There is also a suspicion of a new infection contributing to the altered mental status"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old with Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock who remains critically ill. The patient has multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and limited mental status (MS) improvement, along with recurrent seizures despite being on therapeutic dilantin. The patient has a history of EtOH cirrhosis and cardiomyopathy. There are several ongoing medical issues, including hypotension, anemia, altered mental status, renal failure, respiratory failure, and cardiomyopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, requiring ongoing pressor support. This could indicate persistent septic shock or other underlying causes.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. Despite receiving a blood transfusion, there was an inappropriate response, and the goal hemoglobin level of >25 has not been achieved.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is multifactorial, likely due to seizures, toxic metabolic, renal failure, and hepatic dysfunction. The recent infection has not improved the patient's mental status.
4. Renal Failure: The patient is essentially anuric and has little potential for recovery of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). CVVH is being restarted, running even to slightly net negative.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of Listeria meningitis, fungemia, and septic shock who is still critically ill and experiencing multi-organ dysfunction. He has limited mental status improvement and recurrent seizures despite being on therapeutic dilantin. His overall prognosis is quite poor. 

The patient's current conditions include:
- Fungemia: The patient has been on fluconazole and surveillance cultures have been negative so far.
- Listeriosis: The patient is being treated with ampicillin and bactrim for a six-week course.
- Hypotension: The patient continues to require pressor support.
- Anemia: The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells but showed an inappropriate response.
- Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is thought to be multifactorial and complicated by new infections.
- Renal failure: The patient is essentially anuric and there is little potential for recovery of acute tubular necrosis.
- Respiratory failure: The patient has a right-sided infiltrate in the setting of aspiration during a seizure.
- Cardiomyopathy: The patient's TTE showed improved function and normal biventricular function.
- EtOH cirrhosis: The patient is being continued on rifaximin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension and increasing pressor requirements may indicate ongoing septic shock or another underlying cause"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis who presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis. He now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient's family made him comfort measures only (CMO) by the morning. He is on morphine and Ativan for pain and agitation, and has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which indicates a severe infection affecting multiple organ systems. Without appropriate management, there is a risk of ongoing sepsis and potential deterioration.
2. Multiorgan System Failure: The patient's current condition suggests multiorgan system failure, which can lead to complications such as renal failure, respiratory failure, hepatic dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability. These complications can worsen if not properly managed.
3. Meningitis/Cerebritis: The patient is presumed to have meningitis/cerebritis, which is a serious infection affecting the brain and spinal cord coverings. Complications such as increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, and seizures may arise if not treated promptly and effectively.
4. Difficult-to-Control Seizures: The patient is experiencing difficult-to-control seizures, which can increase the risk of further brain injury, respiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with DM and cirrhosis presented to an OSH in septic shock, likely
   secondary to listeriosis now w/ multiorgansystem failure and presumed
   meningitis/cerebritis and difficult to control seizures, now with
   fungemia.
   * Altered mental status/seizures: wax and wane mental status
   -f/u free dilantin level, d/w neuro dilantin dosing
   -continue fluc, [**Last Name (un) **], bactrim
   - if seizes, check FS
   * Fungemia: all lines growing fungus
   - beginning to become hypothermic again, culture if hypothermic
   - f/u cultures
   - treat w/ fluconazole
   * Respiratory failure: focal opacities of RLL likely related to
   aspiration in setting of seizure
   - switch to ampicillin, continue bactrim, d/c meropenem and vancomycin
   - follow ABGs
   * Anemia:  Microcytic
   -trend daily
   -stable
   * eosinophilia:
   -trend, currently absolute eosinophilia count 500
   * Hypotension: attempt to wean pressors, unclear if related to fungemia
   and listeria.
   -Wean pressors to keep MAP > 60
   * Acute anuric renal failure:
   -CVVH, goal I/O even
   -f/u renal recs
   * cirrhosis.
   -lactulose, rifaximin
   -trend thrombocytopena

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis. He presented to the hospital in septic shock, likely secondary to listeriosis, and now has multiorgan system failure, presumed meningitis/cerebritis, and difficult-to-control seizures. The patient also has fungemia and respiratory failure with focal opacities in the right lower lobe likely related to aspiration during a seizure. Other medical conditions include anemia, eosinophilia, hypotension, acute anuric renal failure, cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has had difficult-to-control seizures, which can lead to further neurological complications if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure, compounded by aspiration, may worsen if ventilation support is not optimized.
3. Fungemia: The presence of fungemia increases the risk of systemic infection and potential dissemination of fungal organisms.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, possibly related to fungemia and listeria, needs careful monitoring and management to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
5. Acute anuric renal failure: The patient's acute anuric renal failure requires prompt intervention, such as continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), to manage fluid balance and prevent further renal damage.
6. Cirrhosis: The"
