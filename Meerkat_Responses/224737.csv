   severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary
   hypertension who presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal
   failure, failed diuresis on the medicine and [**Hospital Unit Name 3031**] floors with lasix
   boluses, gtt, and metolazone, and was transferred to the CCU for
   milrenone.
   .
   .
   # Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated. EF 20-25% with
   worsening 3+ mitral/tricuspid regurgitation.
   - continue milrenone at 0.375 mcg/kg/min and after PICC placed
   uptitrate to 0.5 mcg/kg/min if needed for goal
   - lasix drip: started at 20 mg/hr with possible max up to 30
   - metalozone 5 mg q12h
   - continue metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - holding ACE given ARF, but will restart prior to discharge
   - will use phenlyephrine to keep sbp in 90s if needed (may need picc
   versus central line)
   - Continue to monitor daily weights, strict I/Os.
   - contingency if failure to diurese would be dialysis vs home hospice
   .
   # Acute renal failure: The nephrology team looked at urine sediment and
   noted hyaline casts c/w prerenal etiology rather than ATN. Renal US
   WNL.
   - continue diuresis as above
   - renally dose medications
   - renal recs
   - no dialysis for now
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation:
   - holding coumadin given supratherapitic INR
   - will plan to restart coumadin when INR < 2.5
   .
   # Mitral/tricuspid regurgitation: Likely contributing to patient's CHF
   as well as worsened by volume overload.  Unfortunately, pt not a good
   surgical candidate for repair.
   - continue diuresis as above

The patient is currently admitted to the CCU.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-25% can lead to further deterioration in cardiac function, resulting in worsening heart failure symptoms.

2. Tricuspid and Mitral Regurgitation: The severe regurgitation of these valves can contribute to the patient's CHF exacerbation and right heart failure. Surgical repair may be challenging due to the patient's age and other comorbidities.

3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's severe pulmonary hypertension can worsen right heart failure and limit cardiac output. Treatment options include medications to reduce pulmonary pressures and optimize cardiac function.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires careful management of fluid balance and electrolytes. Renal function should be monitored closely, and medications need to be adjusted accordingly.

5. Atrial Fibrillation"

   DISPO: CCU for now
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
","The patient is an elderly male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, and a history of acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure. He presented with symptoms of increased ectopy after starting milrinone, hypotension in the high 70s to low 80s, and a decrease in urine output from 50-100 cc/hr to 30 cc/hr.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/45-113/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and a balance of -400 mL.

Physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi and decreased breath sounds at the bases, a muffled heart sound, irregular rhythm with a mild systolic murmur, distended abdomen with dullness to percussion at the flanks, and 3+ edema up to the thighs. The patient also has stasis dermatitis without ulcers or xanthomas.

Laboratory results show a blood glucose level of 8 mg/dL, sodium of 140 mEq/L, potassium of 3.7 mg/dL, chloride of 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 24 mEq/L, BUN of 27 mg/dL, creatinine of 3.8 mg/dL, and a urine culture positive for E. coli. The patient's INR is elevated at 4.0.

The patient's assessment and plan include acute decompensated heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20-25%, severe mitral/tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is on milrinone, lasix drip, metoprolol, phenylephrine, and bactrim prophylactically for septic arthritis. The patient's renal failure is attributed to prerenal etiology, and there are plans to restart ACE inhibitors prior to discharge.

The patient's other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), mitral/tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, reactive airways disease, anemia, hypothyroidism, depression, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), gout, and status post dual chamber pacemaker. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, acute renal failure, pulmonary hypertension exacerbation, UTI progression, volume overload, and further electrolyte imbalances."

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension. He presented with an acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute renal failure. He failed diuresis on the medicine floor and was transferred to the CCU for milrinone.

Medical Complications:
1. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated with worsening 3+ mitral/tricuspid regurgitation.
2. Acute renal failure: The nephrology team noted hyaline casts consistent with prerenal etiology rather than acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal US was normal.
3. Atrial fibrillation: Holding coumadin due to supratherapeutic INR. Will plan to restart coumadin when INR < 2.5.
4. E. Coli urinary tract infection (UTI): Elevated WBC and evidence of UTI on urine culture. Allergic to penicillins and ciprofloxacin. Micro to perform sensitivities and treat with doxycycline 7 days.
5. Mitral/tricuspid regurgitation: Likely contributing to the patient's CHF. Unfortunately, the patient is not a good surgical candidate for repair.
6. Pulmonary hypertension: Also contributing to right heart failure and CHF.

   boluses, gtt, and metolazone, and was transferred to the CCU for
   milrenone.
   .
   .
   # Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated. EF 20-25% with
   worsening 3+ mitral/tricuspid regurgitation.
   - place PICC for phenylepherine administration for BP support while on
   milrenone
   - continue milrenone at 0.375 mcg/kg/min and after PICC placed
   uptitrate to 0.5 mcg/kg/min if needed for goal
   - lasix drip: started at 20 mg/hr will increase up to max of 30
   - continue metalozone 5 mg q12h, consider increasing to 10m g
   - continue metoprolol 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - holding ACE given ARF, but will restart prior to discharge
   - Continue to monitor daily weights, strict I/Os.
   - contingency if failure to diurese would be dialysis vs home hospice

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. He presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure. The patient's INR is elevated at 9.5, making it difficult to place a PICC line for medication administration. He has a history of gout, reactive airways disease, depression, hypothyroidism, anemia, and BPH. The patient's current medications include furosemide, phenylephrine, pantoprazole, metolazone, milrinone, and bactrim prophylactically.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is significantly elevated at 9.5, which increases the risk of bleeding complications. This requires careful management and monitoring of any procedures or interventions that may be performed.
2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-25% and severe mitral/tricuspid regurgitation. This puts him at risk for further exacerbation of his CHF symptoms, including pulmonary edema and fluid overload.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a current creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL. This increases the risk of electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, and chronic renal failure. He presented with acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated with an ejection fraction of 20-25% and worsening mitral/tricuspid regurgitation. This could lead to further CHF exacerbation and renal dysfunction.

2. E. Coli Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has evidence of a UTI on urine culture. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can progress to a more severe infection and potentially lead to sepsis.

3. Altered mental status: Likely due to the UTI and hospitalization. If not addressed, it may worsen and result in delirium or other cognitive impairments.

4. Mitral/tricuspid regurgitation: Contributing to the patient's CHF exacerbation. If not managed appropriately, it may continue to worsen cardiac function and lead to further complications.

5. Pulmonary hypertension: Also contributing to right heart failure and CHF. If not controlled, it may result in worsening respiratory status and cardiac output.

6. Anemia:"

   reducing afterload
   - lasix drip: started at 20 mg/hr will increase up to max of 30
   - continue metalozone  to 10 mg q12h
   - stop metoprolol due to hypotension and to improve cardiac
   contractility

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, acute on chronic renal failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure. He has been in the ICU for several days, receiving various treatments including diuretics, milrinone, and phenylephrine for blood pressure support. The patient's current medications include furosemide, pantoprazole, metolazone, and others. His laboratory results show elevated INR, electrolyte imbalances, and evidence of an E. coli urinary tract infection. The patient's medical history includes reactive airways disease, anemia, hypothyroidism, depression, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gout, and previous upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Failure: The patient's non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation contributes to his acute CHF exacerbation. This may lead to further deterioration in cardiac function and worsening of symptoms such as shortness of breath and fluid retention.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure requires close monitoring and management. It is crucial to address the underlying causes and continue diuretic therapy to improve cardiac output and renal function.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, and chronic renal failure. He presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure. The patient's current conditions include dysphagia, coagulopathy, heart failure (diastolic), acute on chronic renal failure, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated INR of 9.5, indicating a bleeding risk due to coagulopathy. His electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with high sodium (139 mEq/L) and low potassium (3.7 mEq/L). The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL.

The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, with over 100,000 organisms per mL. He is allergic to penicillins, ciprofloxacin, and has already been on bactrim prophylactically for septic arthritis. Antibiotic sensitivity testing should be performed to treat the UTI with doxycycline for 7 days.

The patient's heart condition includes non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-25% and worsening mitral/tricuspid regurgitation. He is currently on milrinone at 0.375 mcg/kg/min and"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] was admitted to the CCU for management of his DCM (LVEF =
   30%) with MR, pulmonary hypertension, TR with acute on chronic left
   ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.  He was begun on
   milrinone and phenylephrine for BP supports with initiation of his
   diuresis with metalazone.  Over past 8 hours, he is negative
   approximately 400cc and making urine output.  Symptomatically, her is
   improved.
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with MR/TR and pulmonary hypertension
   who is responding to diuresis and ionotropic support.  I would favor
   weaning off the phenylephrine to improve his forward cardiac output due
   to his MR.  Our plan is to remove 1 liter daily to improve his symptom
   status.  We will review the options of home care with the patient
   before his discharge.     [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3051**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6109**], MD

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, and acute renal failure. He presented with acute CHF exacerbation and was admitted to the CCU for management. The patient has been started on milrinone and phenylephrine for BP support, as well as diuresis with metalazone. His urine output has improved, and he is showing symptomatic improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dysphagia: The patient has difficulty swallowing, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia and nutritional deficiencies.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated due to Coumadin therapy, putting him at risk for bleeding complications.
3. Heart Failure (CHF), Diastolic: The patient has diastolic heart failure, which can lead to fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
4. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke.
6. E. Coli UTI: The patient has an active urinary tract infection with E. Coli, which can lead to sepsis if not treated appropriately.
7. Mitral/Tricuspid Regurgitation: The patient has severe"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] is a [**Age over 90 **] YOM with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%),
   severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary
   hypertension who presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal
   failure, failed diuresis on the medicine and [**Hospital Unit Name 3031**] floors with lasix
   boluses, gtt, and metolazone, and was transferred to the CCU for
   milrenone.
   .
   # Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated. EF 20-25% with
   worsening 3+ mitral/tricuspid regurgitation.
   - PICC placed in left arm for phenylepherine administration for BP
   support while on milrenone
   - continue milrenone 0.5 mcg/kg/min with phenylephrine for (goal 1
   L negative)
   - Goal MAPs at 65 rather than 70 to help improve contractility by
   reducing afterload
   - continue lasix drip: started at 20 mg/hr will increase up to max of
   30 (goal 1
 2 L negative)
   - continue metalozone  to 10 mg q12h
   - holding metoprolol due to hypotension and to improve cardiac
   contractility
   - holding ACE given ARF, but will restart prior to discharge
   - Continue to monitor daily weights, strict I/Os.
   - contingency if failure to diurese would be home hospice
   .
   # Acute renal failure: The nephrology team looked at urine sediment and
   noted hyaline casts c/w prerenal etiology rather than ATN. Renal US
   WNL. FeUrea nondiagnostic.
   - continue diuresis as above to improve cardiac output
   - PM lytes
   - renally dose medications
   - renal recs
   - Pt not interested in dialysis, fortunately, not needed at present
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation:
   - restart Coumadin (at low dose) now that INR< 2
   .
   # E. Coli UTI: Elevated WBC to 11.4 on [**2184-2-8**], now decreased.  Urine
   culture grew E Coli and enterococcus.  Was originally started on
   doxycyclin because of allergy to pcn, cipro, ceftriaxone, and pt
   already on bactrim prophylactically for septic arthritis.
   Sensitivities returned and bacteria not sensitive to tetracyclines.
   Clarified allergic reaction as rash and not anphylaxis.
   - D/C doxycycline, and start imepenem
 will monitor for signs of
   allergy/anaphylaxis
   - Blood cultures to r/o urosepsis given doxy did not cover infection
   and pt likely can not mount strong response/already on pressors for BP
   - continue to monitor WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Altered mental status: likely from UTI and hospitalization.
   - Continue imepenem
   - Continue seroquel at night (standing)
   - Continue frequent reorientation
   - Bowel reg
   - Avoid unnecessary lines
   - Ensure hearing aids are working properly and pt wearing glasses as
   frequently as possible
   .
   # cough:
   - continue suctioning PRN
   - mucinex
   - nebs PRN
   # pulmonary hypertension: Also contributing to right heart failure and
   CHF.  [**Month (only) 8**] make it difficult to acheive good cardiac output.
   .
   # Mitral/tricuspid regurgitation: Likely contributing to patient's CHF
   as well as worsened by volume overload.  Unfortunately, pt not a good
   surgical candidate for repair.
   - continue diuresis as above
   # Status post duel chamber [**Company 7425**] pacemaker: EP consulted to
   interrogate pacer [**2184-3-11**] and showed no arrhythmias, baseline atrial
   fibrilation with adequate rate control.
   .
   # Reactive airways disease: PFTs performed in [**11-11**] showed improvement
   with methacholine challenge indicating reactive airways disease. Pt not
   on inhaler for outpt regimen.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
   .
   #  Anemia:
   Patient had guaiac positive stools. Iron studies indicative of iron
   deficiency (low MCV and ferretin).  Received transfusion [**2184-2-9**].  Pt
   has history of previous upper GIB with ulcer in the proximal bulb on
   EGD in [**2181**].  Last [**Last Name (un) **] [**2181**] was normal.
   - continue supplemental iron
   - continue protonix
   - outpatient GI w/u with EGD
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH was found to be elevated to 5.9. Levothyroxine
   increased frmo 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily on [**2184-3-11**].
   - Outpatient f/u TSH.
   .
   # Depression: continue home escitalopram/seroquel
   .
   # BPH: continue tamsulosin
   .
   # S/p right knee replacement/multiple infections: continue suppressive
   bactrim
   .
   # Gout: holding allopurinol given not active and ARF
   FEN:  Regular cardiac healthy diet, 2 gm na restriction, water
   restriction 1.5 L

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension. He presented with acute congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute renal failure. He failed diuresis on the medicine floor and was transferred to the CCU for milrinone. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, cough, pulmonary hypertension, mitral/tricuspid regurgitation, and reactive airways disease. He also has several chronic conditions such as anemia, hypothyroidism, depression, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gout, and status post dual chamber pacemaker.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, which contribute to his congestive heart failure. Complications may include worsening of heart failure symptoms, fluid overload, and arrhythmias.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with hyaline casts indicating prerenal etiology. Complications may include worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's severe pulmonary hypertension contributes to right heart failure and can lead to further complications such as cor pulmonale, right ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary edema.
4. Mitral/Tricuspid Regurgitation: The patient's severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation can worsen heart failure symptoms and lead to complications such as atrial fibrillation, heart rhythm disturbances, and cardiac remodeling.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to UTI or hospitalization. Complications may include delirium, confusion, and risk of falls.
6. Cough: The patient's cough may be due to heart failure or respiratory issues. Complications may include aspiration pneumonia or worsening respiratory status.
7. Anemia: The patient's iron deficiency anemia can lead to complications such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism can lead to complications such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and decreased metabolism.
9. Depression: The patient's depression can lead to complications such as decreased quality of life, suicidal ideation, and non-compliance with treatment.
10. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH): The patient's BPH can lead to complications such as urinary retention, urinary tract infections, and renal dysfunction.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's medical history, current condition, and potential complications. It is important to consult with the patient's healthcare provider for a comprehensive evaluation and management plan."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated with worsening 3+ mitral/tricuspid regurgitation. The patient's CHF is likely contributing to right heart failure. 
2. Acute renal failure: The nephrology team noted hyaline casts consistent with prerenal etiology rather than acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal US was normal, and FeUrea was nondiagnostic.
3. E. coli UTI: The patient's urine culture grew E. coli and enterococcus. The initial antibiotic, doxycycline, was ineffective as the bacteria were not sensitive to tetracyclines. The patient has allergies to penicillins, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and is currently on bactrim prophylactically for septic arthritis. Imipenem will be started to cover both E. coli and enterococcus.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] is a [**Age over 90 **] YOM with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%),
   severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary
   hypertension who presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal
   failure, failed diuresis on the medicine and [**Hospital Unit Name 3031**] floors with lasix
   boluses, gtt, and metolazone, and was transferred to the CCU for
   milrenone.
   .
   # Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated. EF 20-25% with
   worsening 3+ mitral/tricuspid regurgitation.  Had good urine output on
   current regimen while maintaining blood pressure.  Clinically improving
   edema.
   - continue milrenone 0.5 mcg/kg/min with phenylephrine and lasix gtt
   for (goal [**1-9**]  L negative)
   - continue metalozone  to 10 mg q12h
   - Goal MAPs at 65 rather than 70 to help improve contractility by
   reducing afterload
   - continue low dose metoprolol which has improved ectopy
   - holding ACE given ARF, but will restart prior to discharge
   - Continue to monitor daily weights, strict I/Os.
   - contingency if failure to diurese would be home hospice
   .
   # Acute renal failure: The nephrology team looked at urine sediment and
   noted hyaline casts c/w prerenal etiology rather than ATN. Renal US
   WNL. FeUrea nondiagnostic.
   - continue diuresis as above to improve cardiac output
   - PM lytes
   - renally dose medications
   - renal recs
   - Pt not interested in dialysis, fortunately, not needed at present
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation:
   - continue Coumadin 2 mg
   .
   # E. Coli UTI: Urine culture grew E Coli and enterococcus.  Was
   originally started on doxycyclin because of allergy to pcn, cipro,
   ceftriaxone, and pt already on bactrim prophylactically for septic
   arthritis.  Sensitivities returned and bacteria not sensitive to
   tetracyclines.  Clarified allergic reaction as rash and not anphylaxis.
   - D/C doxycycline, and start imepenem which will cover both E.coli and
   enterococcus
 will monitor for signs of allergy/anaphylaxis
   - f/u Blood cultures to r/o urosepsis given doxy did not cover
   infection and pt likely can not mount strong response/already on
   pressors for BP
   - continue to monitor WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Altered mental status: likely from ICU psychosis, sleep/wake
   disturbance
   - Continue imepenem
   - Continue seroquel at night (standing)
   - Continue frequent reorientation
   - Bowel reg
   - Avoid unnecessary lines
   - Ensure hearing aids are working properly and pt wearing glasses as
   frequently as possible
   .
   # cough: improved today
   - continue suctioning PRN
   - mucinex
   - nebs PRN
   INACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES
   # pulmonary hypertension: Also contributing to right heart failure and
   CHF.  [**Month (only) 8**] make it difficult to acheive good cardiac output.
   .
   # Mitral/tricuspid regurgitation: Likely contributing to patient's CHF
   as well as worsened by volume overload.  Unfortunately, pt not a good
   surgical candidate for repair.
   - continue diuresis as above
   # Status post duel chamber [**Company 7425**] pacemaker: EP consulted to
   interrogate pacer [**2184-3-11**] and showed no arrhythmias, baseline atrial
   fibrilation with adequate rate control.
   .
   # Reactive airways disease: PFTs performed in [**11-11**] showed improvement
   with methacholine challenge indicating reactive airways disease. Pt not
   on inhaler for outpt regimen.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN
   .
   #  Anemia:
   Patient had guaiac positive stools. Iron studies indicative of iron
   deficiency (low MCV and ferretin).  Received transfusion [**2184-2-9**].  Pt
   has history of previous upper GIB with ulcer in the proximal bulb on
   EGD in [**2181**].  Last [**Last Name (un) **] [**2181**] was normal.
   - continue supplemental iron
   - continue protonix
   - outpatient GI w/u with EGD
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH was found to be elevated to 5.9. Levothyroxine
   increased from 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily on [**2184-3-11**].
   - Outpatient f/u TSH.
   .
   # Depression: continue home escitalopram/seroquel
   .
   # BPH: continue tamsulosin
   .
   # S/p right knee replacement/multiple infections: continue suppressive
   bactrim
   .
   # Gout: holding allopurinol given not active and ARF
   FEN:  Regular cardiac healthy diet, 2 gm na restriction, water
   restriction 1 L
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's

 DYSPHAGIA
 COAGULOPATHY
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension. He presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure. Despite diuretic therapy on the medicine and hospital floors, the patient's condition did not improve, leading to transfer to the CCU for milrinone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy is acutely decompensated with a reduced ejection fraction (EF 20-25%) and worsening mitral/tricuspid regurgitation. This can lead to further heart failure symptoms and complications.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, likely due to prerenal causes as indicated by hyaline casts in the urine sediment. Renal function should be closely monitored, and diuretic therapy may be adjusted accordingly.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin is continued to prevent thromboembolic events.

4. E. coli UTI: The patient's urine culture grew E. coli and enterococcus. The initial antibiotic doxycycline was ineffective, so the patient has been started on imipenem to cover both bacteria. Monitoring for signs of allergy/anaphylaxis and follow-up blood cultures are necessary to rule"

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**], a 90-year-old male, presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure. He has non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%), severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Medical Complications:
1. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a weakened heart muscle leading to reduced cardiac output and fluid accumulation.
2. Severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation: The regurgitation of blood from the heart chambers can worsen heart failure symptoms.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension: Increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries can lead to right-sided heart strain and failure.
4. Acute CHF exacerbation: The patient's heart failure has worsened, leading to fluid overload and respiratory difficulties.
5. Acute renal failure: The kidneys are not functioning properly due to reduced cardiac output and fluid overload.
6. E. coli UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, which requires antibiotic treatment.
7. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing confusion and disorientation, possibly due to ICU psychosis or medication effects.
8. Anemia: The patient has low red blood cell count and iron deficiency, likely due to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Cough: The patient has a persistent cough,"

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). entire CCU team.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension who presented with acute congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute renal failure. He has been treated with diuretics, milrinone, and metolazone, but continues to have fluid overload and requires ongoing diuresis.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is also taking medications for atrial fibrillation, depression, gout, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals jugular venous distension, bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, and 3+ pitting edema in the lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. His complete blood count (CBC) shows anemia with a hemoglobin level of 71 g/L. The coagulation profile indicates a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] is a [**Age over 90 **] YOM with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%),
   severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary
   hypertension who presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal
   failure, failed diuresis on the medicine and [**Hospital Unit Name 3031**] floors with lasix
   boluses, gtt, and metolazone, and was transferred to the CCU for
   milrenone.
   .
   # Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated. EF 20-25% with
   worsening 3+ mitral/tricuspid regurgitation.  Had good urine output on
   current regimen while maintaining blood pressure.  Clinically improving
   edema.
   - continue milrenone 0.5 mcg/kg/min with phenylephrine and lasix gtt
   for (goal [**1-9**]  L negative)
   - continue metalozone  to 10 mg q12h
   - Goal MAPs at 65 rather than 70 to help improve contractility by
   reducing afterload
   - continue low dose metoprolol which has improved ectopy
   - holding ACE given ARF, but will restart prior to discharge
   - Continue to monitor daily weights, strict I/Os.
   - contingency if failure to diurese would be home hospice
   .
   # Acute renal failure: The nephrology team looked at urine sediment and
   noted hyaline casts c/w prerenal etiology rather than ATN. Renal US
   WNL. FeUrea nondiagnostic.
   - continue diuresis as above to improve cardiac output
   - PM lytes
   - renally dose medications
   - renal recs
   - Pt not interested in dialysis, fortunately, not needed at present
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation:
   - continue Coumadin 2 mg
   .
   # E. Coli UTI: Urine culture grew E Coli and enterococcus.  Was
   originally started on doxycyclin because of allergy to pcn, cipro,
   ceftriaxone, and pt already on bactrim prophylactically for septic
   arthritis.  Sensitivities returned and bacteria not sensitive to
   tetracyclines.  Clarified allergic reaction as rash and not anphylaxis.
   - D/C doxycycline, and start imepenem which will cover both E.coli and
   enterococcus
 will monitor for signs of allergy/anaphylaxis
   - f/u Blood cultures to r/o urosepsis given doxy did not cover
   infection and pt likely can not mount strong response/already on
   pressors for BP
   - continue to monitor WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Altered mental status: likely from ICU psychosis, sleep/wake
   disturbance
   - Continue imepenem
   - Continue seroquel at night (standing)
   - Continue frequent reorientation
   - Bowel reg
   - Avoid unnecessary lines
   - Ensure hearing aids are working properly and pt wearing glasses as
   frequently as possible
   .
   # cough: improved today
   - continue suctioning PRN
   - mucinex
   - nebs PRN
   INACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES
   # pulmonary hypertension: Also contributing to right heart failure and
   CHF.  [**Month (only) 8**] make it difficult to acheive good cardiac output.
   .
   # Mitral/tricuspid regurgitation: Likely contributing to patient's CHF
   as well as worsened by volume overload.  Unfortunately, pt not a good
   surgical candidate for repair.
   - continue diuresis as above
   # Status post duel chamber [**Company 7425**] pacemaker: EP consulted to
   interrogate pacer [**2184-3-11**] and showed no arrhythmias, baseline atrial
   fibrilation with adequate rate control.
   .
   # Reactive airways disease: PFTs performed in [**11-11**] showed improvement
   with methacholine challenge indicating reactive airways disease. Pt not
   on inhaler for outpt regimen.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN
   .
   #  Anemia:
   Patient had guaiac positive stools. Iron studies indicative of iron
   deficiency (low MCV and ferretin).  Received transfusion [**2184-2-9**].  Pt
   has history of previous upper GIB with ulcer in the proximal bulb on
   EGD in [**2181**].  Last [**Last Name (un) **] [**2181**] was normal.
   - continue supplemental iron
   - continue protonix
   - outpatient GI w/u with EGD
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH was found to be elevated to 5.9. Levothyroxine
   increased from 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily on [**2184-3-11**].
   - Outpatient f/u TSH.
   .
   # Depression: continue home escitalopram/seroquel
   .
   # BPH: continue tamsulosin
   .
   # S/p right knee replacement/multiple infections: continue suppressive
   bactrim
   .
   # Gout: holding allopurinol given not active and ARF
   FEN:  Regular cardiac healthy diet, 2 gm na restriction, water
   restriction 1 L
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx Coumadin restarted

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20-25%), severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension. The patient presented with acute congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute renal failure. 

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and adhesive tape. He was previously on doxycycline but developed a rash which was clarified as not anaphylaxis but a reaction to the medication. The patient's urine culture grew E. coli and enterococcus, so he was started on imipenem to cover both organisms. 

The patient's current medications include milrinone, furosemide (Lasix), metolazone, pantoprazole (Protonix), and vancomycin. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
- Heart rate: 79 bpm (with a range of 74-92 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 98/60 mmHg (with a range of 70-131/44-78 mmHg)

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] is a [**Age over 90 **] YOM with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%),
   severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary
   hypertension who presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal
   failure, failed diuresis on the medicine and [**Hospital Unit Name 3031**] floors with lasix
   boluses, gtt, and metolazone, and was transferred to the CCU for
   milrenone.
   .
   # Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated. EF 20-25% with
   worsening 3+ mitral/tricuspid regurgitation.  Clinically improving
   edema.  Good UOP 7.8 L negative over length of stay with daily net
   around 1.8 L negative for the past few days.  Estimated 3 L more to
   diurese before dry weight.
   - No changes to diuresis plan today
 continue settings with possible
   call out to the floor tomorrow if make goals of 2 L negative
   - continue milrenone 0.5 mcg/kg/min with phenylephrine and lasix gtt
   for (goal [**1-7**]  L negative today)
   - continue metalozone  to 10 mg q12h
   - fluid restrict to 1 L
   - Goal MAPs at 65 rather than 70 to help improve contractility by
   reducing afterload
   - continue low dose metoprolol which has improved ectopy
   - holding ACE given ARF, but will restart prior to discharge
   - Continue to monitor daily weights, strict I/Os.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Thought to be pre-renal based on renal input and
   urine lytes. Creatinine improving with diuresis.
   - continue diuresis as above to improve cardiac output
   - PM lytes, replete
   - renally dose medications
   - renal recs
   - Pt not interested in dialysis, fortunately, not needed at present
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: INR today is 1.8 (subthraputic)
   - increase Coumadin to 2.5 mg
   .
   # E. Coli UTI: Urine culture grew E Coli and enterococcus.  Was
   originally started on doxycycline because of allergy to pcn, cipro,
   ceftriaxone, and pt already on bactrim prophylactically for septic
   arthritis.  Sensitivities returned and bacteria not sensitive to
   tetracyclines.  Clarified allergic reaction as rash and not
   anphylaxis.  Was started on imepenem [**2184-2-12**], but changed to vanc and
   meropenem on [**2184-2-13**].  Appreciate ID recs.
   - Continue vanc to cover enterococcus (D # 4 of 7)
   - Continue meropenem to cover E Coli
  will monitor for signs of
   allergy/anaphylaxis (D # 4 of 7)
   - holding prophylactic dose of bactrim and will restart when complete
   vanc/meropenem course
   - f/u Blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Altered mental status: likely from ICU psychosis, sleep/wake
   disturbance
   - Continue antibiotics to treat infection
   - Continue seroquel at night (standing)
   - Continue frequent reorientation
   - Bowel reg
   - Avoid unnecessary lines
   - Ensure hearing aids are working properly and pt wearing glasses as
   frequently as possible
   .
   #  Anemia:
   Patient had guaiac positive stools initially. Iron studies indicative
   of iron deficiency (low MCV and ferretin).  Pt has history of previous
   upper GIB with ulcer in the proximal bulb on EGD in [**2181**].  Last [**Last Name (un) **]
   [**2181**] was normal.  Received transfusion [**2184-2-9**] and again on [**2184-2-13**].
   Hct stable currently.
   - continue supplemental iron
   - continue protonix
   - outpatient GI w/u with EGD
   - transfuse for Hct < 25
   .
   # Goals of care: Approached by [**Name (NI) 189**] [**Name (NI) 2130**] (pt
s OT and caregiver) who
   states that she and patient
s daughter [**Name (NI) 12622**] [**Name (NI) 12483**] are pushing
   toward DNR/DNI status, however, son rigidly wants Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] to be
   full code.  The health care proxy is a different daughter who currently
   is vacationing in [**Country 3153**].  The patient does not want the family to
   notify this daughter of his condition to
protect her vacation.
  She
   is returning on Sunday, [**2184-3-21**].
   -- address goals of care with HCP when she returns
   -- deferring palliative care consult at the request of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2130**] who
   states this would infuriate the son and has been tried in the past
   .
   INACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES
   # cough: improved
   - continue suctioning PRN
   - mucinex
   - nebs PRN
   # pulmonary hypertension: Also contributing to right heart failure and
   CHF.  [**Month (only) 8**] make it difficult to acheive good cardiac output.
   .
   # Mitral/tricuspid regurgitation: Likely contributing to patient's CHF
   as well as worsened by volume overload.  Unfortunately, pt not a good
   surgical candidate for repair.
   - continue diuresis as above
   # Status post duel chamber [**Company 7425**] pacemaker: EP consulted to
   interrogate pacer [**2184-3-11**] and showed no arrhythmias, baseline atrial
   fibrilation with adequate rate control.
   .
   # Reactive airways disease: PFTs performed in [**11-11**] showed improvement
   with methacholine challenge indicating reactive airways disease. Pt not
   on inhaler for outpt regimen.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH was found to be elevated to 5.9. Levothyroxine
   increased from 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily on [**2184-3-11**].
   - Outpatient f/u TSH.
   .
   # Depression: continue home escitalopram/seroquel
   .
   # BPH: continue tamsulosin
   .
   # S/p right knee replacement/multiple infections: continue suppressive
   bactrim
   .
   # Gout: holding allopurinol given not active and ARF
   FEN:  Regular cardiac healthy diet, 2 gm na restriction, water
   restriction 1 L
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). entire CCU team.
   DNR status discussed. DNR.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   He has diuresed far better than I would have expected nased on his
   initial response and the degree of his cardiac lesions.  He is almost
   euvolemic.  Needs another day of brisk diuresis, then tomorrow plan to
   dc milrinone and convert him to an oral regimen consisting of torsemide
   plus metolazone.  Plan is to get him home in 48 - 72 h

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**], a 90-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary hypertension, presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure. He was admitted to the ICU and received various treatments including diuretics, milrinone, and antibiotics. His current condition is stable, but he has several medical complications that require ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] has a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20-25%. This condition is acutely decompensated, and he is experiencing worsening mitral/tricuspid regurgitation. He is clinically improving, but his edema is still present. Diuretics will continue to be used for fluid management.
2. Acute renal failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] is thought to have pre-renal acute renal failure based on renal input and urine electrolytes. His creatinine levels are improving with diuresis. Diuretics will continue to be used to improve cardiac output, and renal dosing of medications will be considered.
3. E. coli UTI: Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] has a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli and enterococcus. He was initially"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] is a [**Age over 90 **] YOM with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%),
   severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary
   hypertension who presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal
   failure, failed diuresis on the medicine and [**Hospital Unit Name 3031**] floors with lasix
   boluses, gtt, and metolazone, and was transferred to the CCU for
   milrenone.
   .
   # Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated. EF 20-25% with
   worsening 3+ mitral/tricuspid regurgitation.  Clinically improving
   edema.  UOP slower yesterday partly due to increased input from blood
   and medications (total was 1 L negative).  Estimated 3 to 5 L more to
   diurese before dry weight.
   - continue milrenone 0.5 mcg/kg/min with phenylephrine and lasix gtt
   for (goal [**1-9**]  L negative today)
   - continue metalozone  to 10 mg q12h
   - fluid restrict to 1 L
   - Goal MAPs at 65 rather than 70 to help improve contractility by
   reducing afterload
   - continue low dose metoprolol which has improved ectopy
   - holding ACE given ARF, but will restart prior to discharge
   - Continue to monitor daily weights, strict I/Os.
   - contingency if failure to diurese would be home hospice
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Thought to be pre-renal based on renal input and
   urine lytes
   - continue diuresis as above to improve cardiac output
   - PM lytes, replete
   - renally dose medications
   - renal recs
   - Pt not interested in dialysis, fortunately, not needed at present
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: INR today is 1.9
   - continue Coumadin 2 mg
   .
   # E. Coli UTI: Urine culture grew E Coli and enterococcus.  Was
   originally started on doxycycline because of allergy to pcn, cipro,
   ceftriaxone, and pt already on bactrim prophylactically for septic
   arthritis.  Sensitivities returned and bacteria not sensitive to
   tetracyclines.  Clarified allergic reaction as rash and not
   anphylaxis.  Was started on imepenem [**2184-2-12**], but changed to vanc and
   meropenem on [**2184-2-13**].  Appreciate ID recs.
   - Continue vanc to cover enterococcus (D # 3 of 7)
   - Continue meropenem to cover E Coli
  will monitor for signs of
   allergy/anaphylaxis (D # 3 of 7)
   - holding prophylactic dose of bactrim and will restart when complete
   vanc/meropenem course
   - f/u Blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC, fever curve

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] is a [**Age over 90 **] YOM with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%),
   severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary
   hypertension who presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal
   failure, failed diuresis on the medicine and [**Hospital Unit Name 3031**] floors with lasix
   boluses, gtt, and metolazone, and was transferred to the CCU for
   milrenone.
   .
   # Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated. EF 20-25% with
   worsening 3+ mitral/tricuspid regurgitation.  Clinically improving
   edema.  Good UOP 7.8 L negative over length of stay with daily net
   around 1.8 L negative for the past few days.  Estimated 3 L more to
   diurese before dry weight.
   - No changes to diuresis plan today
 continue settings with possible
   call out to the floor tomorrow if make goals of 2 L negative
   - Would recommend DC
ing milrenone 0.5 mcg/kg/min with phenylephrine
   and lasix gtt for (goal [**1-7**]  L negative today)
   - Would recommend transitioning PO regimen of torsemide and metolazone
   - fluid restrict to 1 L
   - Goal MAPs at 65 rather than 70 to help improve contractility by
   reducing afterload
   - continue low dose metoprolol which has improved ectopy
   - holding ACE given ARF, but will restart prior to discharge
   - Continue to monitor daily weights, strict I/Os.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Thought to be pre-renal based on renal input and
   urine lytes. Creatinine improving with diuresis.
   - continue diuresis as above to improve cardiac output
   - PM lytes, replete
   - renally dose medications
   - renal recs
   - Pt not interested in dialysis, fortunately, not needed at present
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: INR today is 1.8 (subthraputic)
   - increase Coumadin to 2.5 mg
   .
   # E. Coli UTI: Urine culture grew E Coli and enterococcus.  Was
   originally started on doxycycline because of allergy to pcn, cipro,
   ceftriaxone, and pt already on bactrim prophylactically for septic
   arthritis.  Sensitivities returned and bacteria not sensitive to
   tetracyclines.  Clarified allergic reaction as rash and not
   anphylaxis.  Was started on imepenem [**2184-2-12**], but changed to vanc and
   meropenem on [**2184-2-13**].  Appreciate ID recs.
   - Would favor dc
ing vanc to amp given thrombocytopenia to cover
   enterococcus (D # 5 of 7)
   - Continue meropenem to cover E Coli
  will monitor for signs of
   allergy/anaphylaxis (D # 5 of 7)
   - holding prophylactic dose of bactrim and will restart when complete
   vanc/meropenem course
   - f/u Blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Altered mental status: likely from ICU psychosis, sleep/wake
   disturbance
   - Continue antibiotics to treat infection
   - Continue seroquel at night (standing)
   - Continue frequent reorientation
   - Bowel reg
   - Avoid unnecessary lines
   - Ensure hearing aids are working properly and pt wearing glasses as
   frequently as possible
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Most likely drug-induced. Down to 50s from 100s,
   started trending down on [**3-14**], same day as starting vancomycin. [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   does not cause, and pt takes quietapine at home.
   - Would recommend changing contacting ID to change vancomycin to
   ampicillin
   #  Anemia:
   Stable. Patient had guaiac positive stools initially. Iron studies
   indicative of iron deficiency (low MCV and ferretin).  Pt has history
   of previous upper GIB with ulcer in the proximal bulb on EGD in [**2181**].
   Last [**Last Name (un) **] [**2181**] was normal.  Received transfusion [**2184-2-9**] and again on
   [**2184-2-13**].  Hct stable currently.
   - continue supplemental iron
   - continue protonix
   - outpatient GI w/u with EGD
   - transfuse for Hct < 25
   .
   # Goals of care: Approached by [**Name (NI) 189**] [**Name (NI) 2130**] (pt
s OT and caregiver) who
   states that she and patient
s daughter [**Name (NI) 12622**] [**Name (NI) 12483**] are pushing
   toward DNR/DNI status, however, son rigidly wants Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] to be
   full code.  The health care proxy is a different daughter who currently
   is vacationing in [**Country 3153**].  The patient does not want the family to
   notify this daughter of his condition to
protect her vacation.
  She
   is returning on Sunday, [**2184-3-21**].
   -- address goals of care with HCP when she returns
   -- deferring palliative care consult at the request of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2130**] who
   states this would infuriate the son and has been tried in the past
   .
   INACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES
   # cough: improved
   - continue suctioning PRN
   - mucinex
   - nebs PRN
   # pulmonary hypertension: Also contributing to right heart failure and
   CHF.  [**Month (only) 8**] make it difficult to acheive good cardiac output.
   .
   # Mitral/tricuspid regurgitation: Likely contributing to patient's CHF
   as well as worsened by volume overload.  Unfortunately, pt not a good
   surgical candidate for repair.
   - continue diuresis as above
   # Status post duel chamber [**Company 7425**] pacemaker: EP consulted to
   interrogate pacer [**2184-3-11**] and showed no arrhythmias, baseline atrial
   fibrilation with adequate rate control.
   .
   # Reactive airways disease: PFTs performed in [**11-11**] showed improvement
   with methacholine challenge indicating reactive airways disease. Pt not
   on inhaler for outpt regimen.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH was found to be elevated to 5.9. Levothyroxine
   increased from 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily on [**2184-3-11**].
   - Outpatient f/u TSH.
   .
   # Depression: continue home escitalopram/seroquel
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 90-year-old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal failure. He failed diuresis on the medicine and ICU floors and was transferred to the CCU for milrinone. The patient's current condition includes delirium, dysphagia, coagulopathy, heart failure (CHF), diastolic, acute on chronic renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF), and altered mental status likely from ICU psychosis, sleep/wake disturbance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to ICU psychosis or sleep/wake disturbance. Close monitoring and frequent reorientation are recommended.
2. Dysphagia: The patient has difficulty swallowing, which increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Suctioning of secretions and ensuring proper positioning during feeding are essential.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR of 9.5 indicates a bleeding risk. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt intervention in case of bleeding events are necessary.
4. Heart Failure (CHF), diastolic, acute on chronic: The patient's worsening heart failure exacerbation poses a risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema. Diuretic therapy and fluid restriction should be continued to manage these symptoms.
5. Renal Failure, acute ("

 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE ON CHRONIC
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] is a [**Age over 90 **] YOM with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%),
   severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary
   hypertension who presented with acute CHF exacerbation and acute renal
   failure, failed diuresis on the medicine and [**Hospital Unit Name 3031**] floors with lasix
   boluses, gtt, and metolazone, and was transferred to the CCU for
   milrenone.
   .
   # Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: Acutely decompensated. EF 20-25% with
   worsening 3+ mitral/tricuspid regurgitation. Clinically improving
   edema.  Good UOP 7.8 L negative over length of stay with daily net
   around 1.8 L negative for the past few days.  Estimated 3 L more to
   diurese before dry weight.
   - No changes to diuresis plan today
 continue settings with possible
   call out to the floor tomorrow if make goals of 2 L negative
   - Would recommend DC
ing milrenone 0.5 mcg/kg/min with phenylephrine
   and lasix gtt for (goal [**1-7**]  L negative today)
   - Would recommend transitioning PO regimen of torsemide and metolazone
   - fluid restrict to 1 L
   - Goal MAPs at 65 rather than 70 to help improve contractility by
   reducing afterload
   - continue low dose metoprolol which has improved ectopy
   - holding ACE given ARF, but will restart prior to discharge
   - Continue to monitor daily weights, strict I/Os.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Thought to be pre-renal based on renal input and
   urine lytes. Creatinine improving with diuresis.
   - continue diuresis as above to improve cardiac output
   - PM lytes, replete
   - renally dose medications
   - renal recs
   - Pt not interested in dialysis, fortunately, not needed at present
   .
   # Atrial fibrilation: INR today is 1.8 (subthraputic)
   - increase Coumadin to 2.5 mg
   .
   # E. Coli UTI: Urine culture grew E Coli and enterococcus.  Was
   originally started on doxycycline because of allergy to pcn, cipro,
   ceftriaxone, and pt already on bactrim prophylactically for septic
   arthritis.  Sensitivities returned and bacteria not sensitive to
   tetracyclines.  Clarified allergic reaction as rash and not
   anphylaxis.  Was started on imepenem [**2184-2-12**], but changed to vanc and
   meropenem on [**2184-2-13**].  Appreciate ID recs.
   - Would favor dc
ing vanc to amp given thrombocytopenia to cover
   enterococcus (D # 5 of 7)
   - Continue meropenem to cover E Coli
  will monitor for signs of
   allergy/anaphylaxis (D # 5 of 7)
   - holding prophylactic dose of bactrim and will restart when complete
   vanc/meropenem course
   - f/u Blood cultures
   - continue to monitor WBC, fever curve
   .
   # Altered mental status: likely from ICU psychosis, sleep/wake
   disturbance
   - Continue antibiotics to treat infection
   - Continue seroquel at night (standing)
   - Continue frequent reorientation
   - Bowel reg
   - Avoid unnecessary lines
   - Ensure hearing aids are working properly and pt wearing glasses as
   frequently as possible
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Most likely drug-induced. Down to 50s from 100s,
   started trending down on [**3-14**], same day as starting vancomycin. [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   does not cause, and pt takes quietapine at home.
   - Would recommend changing contacting ID to change vancomycin to
   ampicillin
   #  Anemia:
   Stable. Patient had guaiac positive stools initially. Iron studies
   indicative of iron deficiency (low MCV and ferretin).  Pt has history
   of previous upper GIB with ulcer in the proximal bulb on EGD in [**2181**].
   Last [**Last Name (un) **] [**2181**] was normal.  Received transfusion [**2184-2-9**] and again on
   [**2184-2-13**].  Hct stable currently.
   - continue supplemental iron
   - continue protonix
   - outpatient GI w/u with EGD
   - transfuse for Hct < 25
   .
   # Goals of care: Approached by [**Name (NI) 189**] [**Name (NI) 2130**] (pt
s OT and caregiver) who
   states that she and patient
s daughter [**Name (NI) 12622**] [**Name (NI) 12483**] are pushing
   toward DNR/DNI status, however, son rigidly wants Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] to be
   full code.  The health care proxy is a different daughter who currently
   is vacationing in [**Country 3153**].  The patient does not want the family to
   notify this daughter of his condition to
protect her vacation.
  She
   is returning on Sunday, [**2184-3-21**].
   -- address goals of care with HCP when she returns
   -- deferring palliative care consult at the request of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2130**] who
   states this would infuriate the son and has been tried in the past
   .
   INACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES
   # cough: improved
   - continue suctioning PRN
   - mucinex
   - nebs PRN
   # pulmonary hypertension: Also contributing to right heart failure and
   CHF.  [**Month (only) 8**] make it difficult to acheive good cardiac output.
   .
   # Mitral/tricuspid regurgitation: Likely contributing to patient's CHF
   as well as worsened by volume overload.  Unfortunately, pt not a good
   surgical candidate for repair.
   - continue diuresis as above
   # Status post duel chamber [**Company 7425**] pacemaker: EP consulted to
   interrogate pacer [**2184-3-11**] and showed no arrhythmias, baseline atrial
   fibrilation with adequate rate control.
   .
   # Reactive airways disease: PFTs performed in [**11-11**] showed improvement
   with methacholine challenge indicating reactive airways disease. Pt not
   on inhaler for outpt regimen.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH was found to be elevated to 5.9. Levothyroxine
   increased from 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily on [**2184-3-11**].
   - Outpatient f/u TSH.
   .
   # Depression: continue home escitalopram/seroquel
   .
   # BPH: continue tamsulosin
   .
   # S/p right knee replacement/multiple infections: continue suppressive
   bactrim
   .
   # Gout: holding allopurinol given not active and ARF
   FEN:  Regular cardiac healthy diet, 2 gm na restriction, water
   restriction 1 L
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an elderly male with multiple comorbidities including non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, severe pulmonary hypertension, acute on chronic renal failure, and a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's current condition includes acute decompensated heart failure, delirium, dysphagia, coagulopathy, and anemia. The patient is also experiencing thrombocytopenia and has a history of allergies to penicillins and cephalosporins.

The patient's goals of care are currently being addressed by the healthcare proxy, who is awaiting the return of the patient's daughter. The patient's family is discussing the goals of care, with the son advocating for full code status and the other family members preferring DNR/DNI status.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening heart failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of infections due to prolonged ICU stay, and worsening of coagulopathy. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values will be crucial in managing these potential complications.

It is important to note that the patient's health condition is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology, nephrology, gastroenterology, and other relevant specialties. Regular communication and collaboration among the healthcare team members will help in providing optimal care for the patient."

   - Continue frequent reorientation
   - Bowel reg
   - Avoid unnecessary lines
   - Ensure hearing aids are working properly and pt wearing glasses as
   frequently as possible
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Most likely drug-induced. Down to 50s from 100s,
   started trending down on [**3-14**], same day as starting vancomycin. [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   does not cause, and pt takes quietapine at home.
   - Would recommend changing contacting ID to DC vancomycin
   #  Anemia:
   Stable. Patient had guaiac positive stools initially. Iron studies
   indicative of iron deficiency (low MCV and ferretin).  Pt has history
   of previous upper GIB with ulcer in the proximal bulb on EGD in [**2181**].
   Last [**Last Name (un) **] [**2181**] was normal.  Received transfusion [**2184-2-9**] and again on
   [**2184-2-13**].  Hct stable currently.
   - continue supplemental iron
   - continue protonix
   - outpatient GI w/u with EGD
   - transfuse for Hct < 25

   # Goals of care: Approached by [**Name (NI) 189**] [**Name (NI) 2130**] (pt
s OT and caregiver) who
   states that she and patient
s daughter [**Name (NI) 12622**] [**Name (NI) 12483**] are pushing
   toward DNR/DNI status, however, son rigidly wants Mr. [**Known lastname 12483**] to be
   full code.  The health care proxy is a different daughter who currently
   is vacationing in [**Country 3153**].  The patient does not want the family to
   notify this daughter of his condition to
protect her vacation.
  She
   is returning on Sunday, [**2184-3-21**].
   -- address goals of care with HCP when she returns
   -- deferring palliative care consult at the request of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 189**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2130**] who
   states this would infuriate the son and has been tried in the past

   INACTIVE/STABLE ISSUES
   # cough: improved
   - continue suctioning PRN
   - mucinex
   - nebs PRN
   # pulmonary hypertension: Also contributing to right heart failure and
   CHF.  [**Month (only) 8**] make it difficult to acheive good cardiac output.
   .
   # Mitral/tricuspid regurgitation: Likely contributing to patient's CHF
   as well as worsened by volume overload.  Unfortunately, pt not a good
   surgical candidate for repair.
   - continue diuresis as above
   # Status post duel chamber [**Company 7425**] pacemaker: EP consulted to
   interrogate pacer [**2184-3-11**] and showed no arrhythmias, baseline atrial
   fibrilation with adequate rate control.
   .
   # Reactive airways disease: PFTs performed in [**11-11**] showed improvement
   with methacholine challenge indicating reactive airways disease. Pt not
   on inhaler for outpt regimen.
   - continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs PRN
   .
   #  Hypothyroidism: TSH was found to be elevated to 5.9. Levothyroxine
   increased from 75 mcg to 100 mcg daily on [**2184-3-11**].
   - Outpatient f/u TSH.
   .
   # Depression: continue home escitalopram/seroquel
   .
   # BPH: continue tamsulosin
   .
   # S/p right knee replacement/multiple infections: continue suppressive
   bactrim
   .
   # Gout: holding allopurinol given not active and ARF

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. He presented with acute congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute renal failure. He is currently in the ICU receiving various medications including milrinone, diuretics, and antibiotics for a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli and enterococcus. The patient's INR is elevated at 9.5, indicating a bleeding risk. He also has thrombocytopenia and anemia, likely due to iron deficiency and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's family is discussing goals of care, with some members wanting him to be full code and others advocating for DNR/DNI status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding risk due to elevated INR.
2. Thrombocytopenia, which may be drug-induced.
3. Anemia, likely secondary to iron deficiency and gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Acute kidney injury or failure.
5. Heart failure exacerbation.
6. Pulmonary hypertension.
7. Urinary tract infection with resistant organisms.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Delirium or confusion.
10. Hypothyroidism.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional information may be necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment."
