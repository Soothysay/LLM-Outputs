   -Given Metoprolol 2.5mg IV x4, Metoprolol 5mg IV x1 (total 15mg) with
   rates 100's-120's.  Asymptomatic.
   -Started Metoprolol 12.5mg po bid, as BP tolerates for rate control
   -Got additional Metoprolol 5mg IV x1 and Metoprolol 12.5mg po extra

   Assessment and Plan
 85 yo F w/ PMHx of CAD, breast CA, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroid
   and chronic hyponatremia admitted with increasing pericardial effusion
   and likely early tamponade physiology
   .
   # RHYTHM: In atrial fibrillation on admission with no history of it.
   Has since converted to NSR spontaneously. Likely due to pericardial
   irritation. Tachycardic.  On [**10-16**] went into a fib with RVR rates
   120-160, asymptomatic; was given Metoprolol for rate control, now with
   rates in 110-120
s with BP as limiting.
   -Monitor on telemetry.
   -Hold on heparin for now given planned procedure this AM and hx of ICH
   -Monitor to see if arrhythmia returns s/p drain
   .
   # Effusions: No clear etiology but the rapid worsening and elevated WBC
   may suggest an infectious etiology. Viral etiologies effusions are most
   likely to be HIV (less likely in 85 yo), with Cocksackie viruses, and
   CMV/EBV possible as well. Bacterial etiology is possible as well given
   rapid development but less likely without fever.  Malignant etiologies
   are less likely given rapid developement and distant malignancy history
   but still possible. No trauma to suggest hemorrhagic effusion. Less
   likely to be autoimmune manifesting now at age 85.
   -Monitor in CCU on telemetry
   -Plan for pericardiocentesis in cath lab this AM; right heart cath this
   AM
   -Will send fluid for cell counts, bacterial/viral/fungal culture, AFB
   smear, gram stain, and cytology
   -Vanc/CTX for possible bacterial etiology until cultures return
   -Maintain current volume status, avoid diuresis for now
   -Hold amlodipine and atenolol out of concern for possible hypotension
   -For sharp chest pain, believed to be related to effusion, consider
   indomethacin s/p pericardiocentesis (not earlier and [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **]
[**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to
   enhance bleeding possibility)
   -Echo this morning (TTE)
   -F/u final read on yesterday
s echo with cardiology attending
   .
   # PUMP: No signs of systolic failure at this time. Dyspnea likely
   related to pleural and pericardial effusions.
   -Maintain euvolemia for now
   .
   # Hypoxia: No signs of pneumonia or PE on CTA. Most likely due to a
   combination of pleural and pericardial effusion. Significant left lung
   collapse/atelectasis on imaging and exam. Influenza negative. Currently
   on CPAP.
   -O2 as needed for sat>93%, continue CPAP for support given lung
   collapse and acidemia on ABG; post-pericardiocentesis, try to wean as
   tolerated
   -Drain pericardial effusion as planned above
   -Consider thoracentesis in AM as well
   -Follow up urine legionella antigen ordered
   .
   # Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 8**] be reactive from respiratory distress or from
   unknown infectious process causing effusions. Also having diarrhea but
   chronic non-bloody.
   -Trend WBC
   -Blood/urine cultures
   -F/u C.diff
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Initial blood samples appear to be hemolyzed but most
   recent sample is now with K of 7.4 but hemolyzed still. Unclear cause
   given lack of renal failure. She is mildly acidemic on her ABGs which
   may be contributing. No EKG changes noted.
   -Recheck potassium
   .
   # Decreased urine output:
   - Monitor I
s & O
   - Consider bladder scan
   .
   # CAD: No signs of ischemia on EKG or CEZ.
   -Con't ASA, Statin
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Known chronic hyponatremia. ?chronic SIADH. [**Month (only) 8**] have
   dCHF contributing to her current worsening of hyponatremia.
   - continue home salt tablets
   - repeat lytes
   .
   # UTI: Klebsiella UTI. Was discharged on Bactrim.
   - cont CTX as above
   - repeat UA

   #  HTN:
   - continue to monitor
   - could consider restarting home atenolol/amlodipine after pericardial
   drain

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Rhythm: Initially in atrial fibrillation on admission, but converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. Currently tachycardic with rates in the 110-120 range.
2. Effusions: No clear etiology, but the rapid worsening and elevated WBC count may suggest an infectious etiology. Viral etiologies such as HIV, Coxsackie viruses, and CMV/EBV are possible, along with bacterial etiology. Malignant etiologies are less likely. No trauma to suggest hemorrhagic effusion.
3. Pump: No signs of systolic failure at this time. Dyspnea likely related to pleural and pericardial effusions.
4. Hypoxia: No signs of pneumonia or PE on CTA. Most likely due to a combination of pleural and pericardial effusion. Significant left lung collapse/atelectasis on imaging and exam.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient experienced several events. She underwent a trans thoracic echo, pericardiocentesis, and PA catheter placement. She also had EKG monitoring and received medication for rate control due to atrial fibrillation. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were monitored closely, and she was given metoprolol to manage her heart rate. She was also started on oral metoprolol for rate control.

The patient had an additional dose of metoprolol IV and an extra dose of oral metoprolol this morning. It was decided not to start anticoagulation as the patient was not being cardioverted, considering recent pericardial drain placement, intracranial hemorrhage in the past, and the potential long-term benefits versus risks in the acute setting.

The patient received Lasix 20mg IV due to positive fluid balance and increased lung pressures. She was also given UCx, BCx, and CXR for the morning as she had low-grade fevers. The patient experienced issues with her pericardial drain, which became plugged with clot earlier in the day. It was resolved"

   Assessment and Plan
 85 yo F w/ PMHx of CAD, breast CA, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroid
   and chronic hyponatremia admitted with increasing pericardial effusion
   and likely early tamponade physiology
   .
   # RHYTHM: In atrial fibrillation on admission with no history of it.
   Has since converted to NSR spontaneously, however back in afib this AM,
   likely due to pericardial irritation from effusion and drain.
   Tachycardic.  Was given multiple doses of metoprolol with some
   improvement in rate, however up-titration was limited by blood
   pressure.
   -Monitor on telemetry.
   -Start anticoagulation after removal of drain if afib does not resolve
   -Remove drain when output<50/day
   -uptitrate beta blocker as tolerated
   -will start digoxin today, add dilt if need additional control of afib.
   .
   # Effusions: No clear etiology but the exudative nature of the effusion
   and elevated WBC may suggest an infectious etiology. Viral etiologies
   effusions are most likely to be HIV (less likely in 85 yo), with
   Cocksackie viruses, and CMV/EBV possible as well. Bacterial etiology is
   possible as well given rapid development but less likely without
   fever.  Malignant etiologies are less likely given rapid developement
   and distant malignancy history but still possible. No trauma to suggest
   hemorrhagic effusion. Less likely to be autoimmune manifesting now at
   age 85.  Now s/p pericardiocentesis with drain in place.
   -Monitor in CCU on telemetry
   -Pericardial fluid results pending
   -Vanc/CTX for possible bacterial etiology until cultures return
   -Maintain current volume status, avoid diuresis for now
   -Pain management with indomethacin, morphine
   .
   # PUMP: No signs of systolic failure at this time. Dyspnea likely
   related to pleural and pericardial effusions.
   -Maintain euvolemia for now
   .
   # Hypoxia: No signs of pneumonia or PE on CTA. Most likely due to a
   combination of pleural and pericardial effusion. Significant left lung
   collapse/atelectasis on imaging and exam. Influenza negative. Currently
   on non-rebreather.
   -O2 as needed for sat>93%, wean as tolerated
   -Thoracentesis today by IP
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Improved.  Most likely due to infectious pericardial
   effusion.
   -trend WBC
   -continue abx
   -follow cxs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Initial blood samples appear to be hemolyzed, improved
   on repeat blood draws.  Will follow.
   .
   # Decreased urine output: improved, will continue to monitor.
   .
   # CAD: No signs of ischemia on EKG or CEZ.
   -Con't ASA, Statin
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Known chronic hyponatremia. ?chronic SIADH. [**Month (only) 8**] have
   dCHF contributing to her current worsening of hyponatremia.
   - continue home salt tablets
   - fiollow
   .
   # UTI: Klebsiella UTI. Was discharged on Bactrim.
   - cont CTX as above
   - repeat UA
   .
   #  HTN:

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. The patient has been in atrial fibrillation on admission but has converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) spontaneously. However, she converted back to atrial fibrillation this morning, likely due to pericardial irritation from the effusion and drain. The patient is tachycardic and has received multiple doses of metoprolol with some improvement in rate, although up-titration was limited by blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion and tamponade: The patient initially presented with a significant pericardial effusion that caused early tamponade physiology. Although pericardiocentesis was performed, there is still a small effusion present. Monitoring for signs of recurrent tamponade is essential.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been in atrial fibrillation on admission and converted back to it this morning. Conversion to NSR is necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability. The patient will be started on digoxin and diltiazem to control the heart rate.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to pleural and pericardial eff"

 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2120-10-16**] 09:20 AM
       The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a very small
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. There may be pericardial thickening.
      Compared to prior study earlier today, the effusion is now much
   smaller and the signs of tamponade have resolved.

   # Effusions: No clear etiology but the exudative nature of the effusion
   and elevated WBC may suggest an infectious etiology. Viral etiologies
   effusions are most likely to be HIV (less likely in 85 yo), with
   Cocksackie viruses, and CMV/EBV possible as well. Bacterial etiology is
   possible as well given rapid development but less likely without
   fever.  Malignant etiologies are less likely given rapid developement
   and distant malignancy history but still possible. No trauma to suggest
   hemorrhagic effusion. Less likely to be autoimmune manifesting now at
   age 85.  Now s/p pericardiocentesis with drain in place.
   -Monitor in CCU on telemetry

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia, was admitted for increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small, but overall left ventricular systolic function is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are also normal. There is a very small pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade. There may be pericardial thickening. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and a drain was placed. The patient's rhythm has been in atrial fibrillation on admission, converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously, but returned to atrial fibrillation this morning, likely due to pericardial irritation from effusion and drain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infectious Etiology: The exudative nature of the effusion and elevated WBC may suggest an infectious etiology. Viral etiologies such as HIV, Coxsackie viruses, and CMV/EBV are possible. Bacterial etiology is also possible, although less likely without fever. The patient is receiving vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible bacterial etiology until cultures return.

2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has significant left lung collapse/atelect"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology.

2. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis. A trans-thoracic echo showed an elongated left atrium, normal left ventricular systolic function, normal right ventricular chamber size, and free wall motion. The ascending aorta was moderately dilated, with mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets but no aortic stenosis or regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets were also mildly thickened, with mild mitral regurgitation. There was a trivial pericardial effusion.

3. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is on amiodarone, metoprolol, and furosemide. Her allergies include penicillins, and she has received various antibiotics since admission.

4. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), a current temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate (HR) of 86 bpm with a range of 73-135 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 109/66 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute with a range of 15-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%.

5. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.2 thousand/mm³ with a slight decrease over time, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 28.1%, platelet count (Plt) of 274 thousand/mm³, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose level of 97 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of less than 0.01 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

6. The patient has an exudative pleural effusion with elevated WBC count, RBC count, and LDH levels. The pericardial fluid analysis is negative for malignant cells, but further results are pending.

7. The patient's plan includes monitoring on telemetry, starting anticoagulation if atrial fibrillation does not resolve, uptitration of beta blockers as tolerated, continuation of digoxin and amiodarone, and addition of diltiazem if needed for additional control of atrial fibrillation.

8. The patient's other conditions, such as pump failure, hypoxia, leukocytosis, hyperkalemia, decreased urine output"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response, which may be due to pericardial irritation from the effusion and drain. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm with irregular rhythm, blood pressure of 109/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a non-rebreather mask. Physical examination shows crackles throughout the left lung, particularly at the base, and right lung with mild crackles. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, hyperkalemia, decreased urine output, and other abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient had a large pericardial effusion that could lead to cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac compresses the heart and impairs its function.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in AF with a rapid ventricular response, which may"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis.

The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation (AF) and has experienced episodes of rapid heart rate. She has been given multiple doses of metoprolol with some improvement, but further up-titration was limited by low blood pressure. She is on Lovenox for anticoagulation and will continue amiodarone. Diltiazem may be considered if additional control of AF is needed in the future.

Effusions (pericardial and pleural): No clear etiology has been identified, but elevated white blood cell count may suggest an infectious etiology. Viral, bacterial, malignant, and autoimmune causes are possible. The patient has undergone pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis. A CT chest today will help rule out lung trapping, and a pulmonary consult is needed to further evaluate the etiology of the effusions. Follow-up of pericardial fluid and pleural fluid results is also necessary. Vancomycin and ceftriaxone are being administered for possible bacterial etiology until cultures return.

   # RHYTHM: In atrial fibrillation on admission with no history of it.
   Has since converted to NSR spontaneously, however back in afib this AM,
   likely due to pericardial irritation from effusion and drain.
   Tachycardic.  Was given multiple doses of metoprolol with some
   improvement in rate, however up-titration was limited by blood

   # Effusions (Pericardial and pleural): No clear etiology but the
   exudative nature of the effusion and elevated WBC may suggest an
   infectious etiology. Viral etiologies effusions are most likely to be
   HIV (less likely in 85 yo), with Cocksackie viruses, and CMV/EBV
   possible as well. Bacterial etiology is possible as well given rapid
   development but less likely without fever.  Malignant etiologies are
   less likely given rapid developement and distant malignancy history but
   still possible. No trauma to suggest hemorrhagic effusion. Less likely
   to be autoimmune manifesting now at age 85.  Now s/p
   pericardiocentesis, drain removed yesterday. Now s/p thoracentesis and
   pleural fluid drainage.
   -Repeat pleural fluid drainage today via thoracentesis (post-procedure
   can consider start heparin for anticoagulation in setting of afib)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Rhythm: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which may be due to pericardial irritation from the effusion and drain. She was given multiple doses of metoprolol with some improvement in rate, but up-titration was limited by blood pressure. Telemetry monitoring is recommended, along with the continuation of Amiodarone and consideration of adding diltiazem if additional control of afib is needed.

2. Effusions (Pericardial and pleural): There is no clear etiology for the effusions, but the exudative nature of the effusion and elevated WBC suggest an infectious etiology. Viral etiologies such as HIV, Coxsackie viruses, and CMV/EBV are possible, as well as bacterial etiologies. Malignant etiologies are less likely given the rapid development and distant malignancy history. No trauma suggests that a hemorrhagic effusion is less likely.

   # Effusions (Pericardial and pleural): No clear etiology but elevated
   WBC may suggest an infectious etiology. Viral etiologies effusions are
   most likely to be HIV (less likely in 85 yo), with Cocksackie viruses,
   and CMV/EBV possible as well. Bacterial etiology is possible as well
   given rapid development but less likely without fever.  Malignant
   etiologies are less likely given rapid development but still possible
   given past malignancy history. No trauma to suggest hemorrhagic
   effusion. Less likely to be autoimmune manifesting now at age 85.  Now
   s/p pericardiocentesis, drain removed yesterday. Now s/p thoracentesis
   and pleural fluid drainage.
   -CT chest today to r/o lung trapping

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis.

The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation, which she had on admission but converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) spontaneously. However, she is now back in atrial fibrillation (AFib) likely due to pericardial irritation from the effusion and drain. She is tachycardic and has been given multiple doses of metoprolol with some improvement in rate, but further up-titration was limited by blood pressure.

The patient's effusions (pericardial and pleural) have no clear etiology, but elevated white blood cell count (WBC) may suggest an infectious etiology. Viral etiologies such as HIV, Coxsackie viruses, and CMV/EBV are possible, as well as bacterial etiology. Malignant etiologies are less likely given the rapid development, but still possible due to the patient's past malignancy history. No trauma suggests that hemorrhagic effusion is less likely, and autoimmune etiology is less likely to manifest now at the age of 85.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis. The patient has been in atrial fibrillation since admission but has spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). She is now back in atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Effusions (Pericardial and pleural): The patient appears to have borderline exudative effusions, and no evidence of malignancy or infection has been found so far. However, the concern for cardiac etiology remains until proven otherwise. The patient will be treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics due to the elevated WBC count.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is most likely due to a combination of pleural and pericardial effusion atelectasis on imaging and examination. She is currently on a shovel mask and will be weaned off as tolerated.
3. Heart Failure/Tamponade: The accumulation of pleural effusions may have contributed to the patient's heart failure/tamponade. Diuretic therapy will be continued to manage fluid accumulation.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is slightly worse today"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, and last received antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftriaxone) on 10/20/20 at 12:30 AM and 02:07 AM respectively. The patient is currently on Coumadin, and dosing of Vanc is being done by trough levels, which was held today due to a high trough level (AM and PM). ID approval is needed for Vanc. The patient has persistent bilateral moderate pleural effusions with associated atelectasis, slightly improved on the left side. There is also a decreased pleural effusion and stable multilevel anterior thoracic wedge fracture. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 79 bpm (range 74-97 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 110/59 mmHg to 133/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (range 14-26), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is currently 67.4 kg, and height is 60 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 968 mL and total output of 1300 mL. The patient is on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, and ABG results are pending. Physical examination"

   however no evidence growth on cultures at this time, no evidence of
   malignancy on pericardial fluid, pleural fluid cytology pending.
   Concern for cardiac etiology at this time until proven otherwise.  Low
   concern for infection given negative gram stains and cxs, however given
   elevated WBC will tx with 7-day course of abx.  Now s/p
   pericardiocentesis with drain placement and removal. Also s/p
   thoracentesis and pleural fluid drainage.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. The patient was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Rhythm: The patient was in atrial fibrillation on admission but has since converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) spontaneously. She is back in atrial fibrillation and will be started on warfarin, with INR monitoring. Beta-blockers will be uptitrated as tolerated, and amiodarone will be continued at a dose of 200 mg/day after a week of loading via IV.

2. Effusions (Pericardial and pleural): The effusions appear borderline exudative, with no evidence of growth on cultures at this time, no evidence of malignancy on pericardial fluid, and pleural fluid cytology pending.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis. She also experienced atrial fibrillation on admission but has since converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. The patient is currently receiving warfarin and beta-blockers as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Effusions (Pericardial and pleural): The patient has borderline exudative effusions with no evidence of growth on cultures or malignancy. There is concern for a cardiac etiology until proven otherwise. The patient will be treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics. The effusions may lead to respiratory distress or cardiac tamponade if not managed properly.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to a combination of pleural and pericardial effusion atelectasis. The patient is currently on nasal cannula 6 liters and will be weaned as tolerated. Oxygen saturation should be maintained above 93%.

3. PUMP (Heart failure/tamponade): The accumulation of pleural effusions may have contributed to heart failure and tamponade. Diuretics will be used to manage fluid accumulation.

4. Leukocytosis: The"

She is on warfarin with an INR of 1.6, and once therapeutic, she will discontinue lovenox. She will also uptitrate beta-blockers as tolerated and continue amiodarone. The patient has leukocytosis with an unclear etiology, but an infectious etiology remains a possibility. She will continue with the current antibiotics. There are no signs of ischemia on EKG or CEZ, so she will continue with ASA, Statin, and BB. The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, which is suspected to be contraction alkalosis. She will be allowed to equilibrate today and diamox may be considered if requiring diuresis. The patient is also experiencing pain at the Foley site, for which she will continue with lidocaine PR"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, breast cancer, anemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. She underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis. The patient's condition has been stable, but she continues to require oxygen due to a combination of pleural and pericardial effusion/atelectasis. She has shown improvement in her hyponatremia and is now ready for disposition to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient initially presented with signs of cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac exerts pressure on the heart, impairing its ability to pump effectively.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient also had a pleural effusion, which is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space surrounding the lungs. This can cause respiratory distress and difficulty in breathing.
3. Infection: The patient received a 7-day course of antibiotics due to leukocytosis, which may indicate an infectious etiology. Although no organism has been identified, it is important to monitor for any signs of infection.
4. Hypoxia: The patient continues to require supplemental oxygen due to hypoxia. This may be related to the previous eff"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, breast cancer (remote), anemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/70 mmHg to 150/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination shows clear lung sounds bilaterally, with crackles in the right lung. No pedal edema is noted. The patient is alert and interactive.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 8.9 to 13.2 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 341 to 373 thousand/mm³, blood glucose levels between 83 and 101 mg/dL, and an elevated lactate level of 0.8 mmol/L.

The patient is currently on several medications, including warfarin, beta-blockers, amiodarone, and diltiazem. She has also received a course of antibiotics (Vancouver and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, breast cancer, anemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis. She responded well to 100mg IV lasix, and her oxygen requirement decreased.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Effusion-related complications: The patient had pericardial and pleural effusions, which could lead to cardiac tamponade and respiratory distress. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Infection: Despite negative gram stains and cultures, there is a concern for infection due to elevated white blood cell count. The patient is being treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and may experience further cardiac complications. Monitoring of EKG and cardiac enzymes is important.
4. Hypoxia: The patient has persistent hypoxia, which may be due to pleural and pericardial effusion/atelectasis. Oxygen therapy and weaning as tolerated should be continued.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an ongoing infection or another underlying cause. Further evaluation and monitoring are required.
6. Chronic hyponatremia:"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, breast cancer, anemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and chronic hyponatremia. She was admitted with increasing pericardial effusion and likely early tamponade physiology. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and thoracentesis. 

The patient's current conditions include effusions (pericardial and pleural), hypoxia, acute renal failure, rhythm disturbances (atrial fibrillation that converted to normal sinus rhythm), heart failure/tamponade, leukocytosis, coronary artery disease, metabolic alkalosis, pain at Foley site, hyponatremia, urinary tract infection, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pericardial and pleural effusions, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, acute kidney injury, infections (such as pneumonia or sepsis), further bleeding due to anticoagulant therapy, electrolyte imbalances, and potential complications related to the patient's pre-existing conditions."
