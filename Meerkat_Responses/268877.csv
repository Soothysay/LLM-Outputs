","The patient is a 18-year-old male who was involved in a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and sustained multiple orthopedic injuries, including a shattered right acetabulum, right inferior pubic rami fracture, left sacroiliac joint diastasis, and sacral ala fracture. He also has a sternal fracture with an anterior mediastinal hematoma, as well as grade 4 splenic laceration, grade 2 liver laceration, and grade 1 renal laceration.

The patient is currently sedated and ventilated in the ICU. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C), heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure of 119/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. He is receiving fentanyl and propofol infusions.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, sodium of 141 mg/dL, potassium of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 125 mg/dL, and creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's neurologic examination reveals that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movements. His extremities are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 18-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU following a motor vehicle accident (MVC). He sustained multiple orthopedic injuries, including a shattered right acetabulum, right pubic rami fracture, left sacroiliac joint diastasis, and sacral ala fracture. Additionally, he has a sternal fracture with an anterior mediastinal hematoma. The patient also has a grade 4 splenic laceration, grade 2 liver laceration, and grade 1 renal laceration.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated on propofol. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 126 bpm, and blood pressure within normal limits. He has a respiratory support set up with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 68.

His laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, his serum creatinine is elevated at 0.9 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Plan:
The patient's plan includes ongoing monitoring of his vital signs, neurologic checks every 1 hour (changed to q4 after extubation), pain management with fentanyl or dilaudid as needed, extubation today, conservative management of intraabdominal lacerations, and consideration for starting artificial nutrition after surgery tomorrow."
