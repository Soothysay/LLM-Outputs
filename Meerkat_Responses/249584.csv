 COAGULOPATHY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of hemoptysis
   #. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure:  Required urgent intubation on
   transfer secondary to fatigue and airway protection (given hemoptysis).
    Bronchoscopy showed DAH, which correlates with the alveolar pattern
   seen on CXR.  Included in the differential is vasculitis - Wegener's
   granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA positivity.  No
   clear infiltrate is seen, although pneumonia is possible given
   prolonged hospital course, immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and
   worsening leukocytosis. Given bilateral patchy opacities on high-dose
   steroids (on prednisone 40+mg PO daily since [**2138-8-30**]) and acutely
   increased O2 requirement, concern for PCP as well. No hemodynamic
   compromise to suggest pulmonary embolism, although patient has been
   bedbound for prolonged period.
   - vent set at A/C 480x14 (rate reduced secondary to
   metabolic/respiratory alkalosis), FiO2 50% (slowly downtitrating as
   tolerated), PEEP 8
   - continue 40mg IV Q8 hours
   - Given high-dose steroids, PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (inhaled
   pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close glucose monitoring
   - continue cytoxan, consent given by daughter
   - monitor hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  DAH seen on bronchoscopy.  Given history of gastritis,
   GI bleed also possible.  OG lavage this AM showed red blood.  Platelets
   98 this AM, therefore mucosal bleed unlikely (although may have uremic
   platelets). Coagulopathic, as below.
   - Serial hct Q6 hours
   - Type and cross 2 units pRBCs
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 or concern for active bleeding
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated.
   - Steroid therapy, as above
   - Will discuss use of Cytoxan with renal
   - Renal recs
   - Avoiding renotoxic agents
   - Plasmaphresis on hold at this point per blood bank
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR elevated on admission. Unlikely to be nutritional
   given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT suspected secondary to sample being
   drawn from heparin-dependent pheresis line, although still elevated to
   >150 on peripheral stick. Of note, inhibitor screen positive [**2138-8-26**];
   unclear which Factor is being inhibited by review of OMR. Concern for
   DIC given anemia, decreasing platelet count, hyperbilirubinemia as
   well.
   - Suspect if inhibitor is playing role that high dose steroids, Cytoxan
   should be of benefit
   - Add on fibrinogen, haptoglobin, FDP, fractionate bilirubin
   - Monitor DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Expected leukocytosis with left-shift given high-dose
   steroids, although continues to rise. No clear evidence of infection -
   without productive cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. Patient
   did present with uncomplicated UTI and was treated 3-day course of
   ciprofloxacin.
   - Sputum, blood, and urine cultures
   - BAL at time of bronchoscopy
   - Hold off on antibiotics, low threshold to start if she decompensates
   .
   #. Metabolic/respiratory alkalosis:  Likely secondary to tachypnea
   prior to intubation in addition to Bicitra (started for low bicarbonate
   secondary to renal dysfunction). Rate increased, Bicitra discontinued.
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed:  First and only episode of bleeding on [**2138-9-9**].
   Suspected to be diverticular vs. ischemic colitis given vasculitis.
   .
   #. Hypertension:  Blood pressure improved with intubation. Written for
   labetalol at this time.
   .
   #. Anemia:  At baseline since admission. Initially attributed to renal
   dysfunction. Several likely contributors currently, including DAH. Also
   with recent GI bleed. Also concern for DIC/hemolysis currently given
   hyperbilirubinemia, decreasing platelet count.
   - Checking DIC labs, as above
   - Smear to assess for schistocytes
   - Maintain hematocrit >25, giving one tranfusion pRBCs now
   .
   FEN:  Careful repletion of lytes given renal failure, NPO at this time
   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots (avoiding all heparin products), PPI IV,
   bowel regimen PRN
   Access:  Pheresis catheter, PIV - may need CVL if any hemodynamic
   instability, A-line (for frequent ABGs)

","The patient is a 97-year-old female with a history of hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis, now presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in the context of hemoptysis. The patient required urgent intubation due to fatigue and airway protection. Bronchoscopy showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which correlates with the alveolar pattern seen on chest X-ray. The differential diagnosis includes vasculitis - Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA positivity. There is also a concern for pneumonia, given prolonged hospitalization, immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and worsening leukocytosis. Additionally, there is a concern for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) due to high-dose steroid use.

The patient has a history of gastritis, and GI bleed is also possible. OG lavage showed red blood, and the platelet count is low, suggesting mucosal bleeding. The patient is coagulopathic, as evidenced by an elevated INR and PTT. There is a concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) given anemia, decreasing platelet count, hyperbilirubinemia, and a positive inhibitor screen. 

The patient has leukocytosis with a left shift, expected due to high-dose steroids, but it continues to rise. No clear evidence of infection is present. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics will be"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of hemoptysis
   #. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure:  Required urgent intubation on
   transfer secondary to fatigue and airway protection (given
   hemoptysis).  Bronchoscopy showed DAH, which correlates with the
   alveolar pattern seen on CXR.  Included in the differential is
   vasculitis - Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis
   given pANCA positivity.  No clear infiltrate is seen, although
   pneumonia is possible given prolonged hospital course,
   immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and worsening leukocytosis.
   Given bilateral patchy opacities on high-dose steroids (on prednisone
   40+mg PO daily since [**2138-8-30**]) and acutely increased O2 requirement,
   concern for PCP as well. No hemodynamic compromise to suggest pulmonary
   embolism, although patient has been bedbound for prolonged period.
   - vent set at A/C 480x14 (rate reduced secondary to
   metabolic/respiratory alkalosis), FiO2 50% (slowly downtitrating as
   tolerated), PEEP 8
   - continue 40mg IV Q8 hours
   - Given high-dose steroids, PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (inhaled
   pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close glucose monitoring
   - continue cytoxan, consent given by daughter
   - monitor hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  DAH seen on bronchoscopy.  Given history of gastritis,
   GI bleed also possible.  OG lavage this AM showed red blood.  Platelets
   98 this AM, but may have uremic platelets.  Pt is coagulopathic, as
   below.
   - Serial hct Q6 hours
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 or concern for active bleeding
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated.
   - Steroid therapy, as above
   - continue cytoxan
   - f/u renal recs
   - Avoiding nephrotoxic agents
   - Plasmaphresis on hold at this point per blood bank
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR elevated on admission. Unlikely to be nutritional
   given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT suspected secondary to sample being
   drawn from heparin-dependent pheresis line, although still elevated to
   >150 on peripheral stick. Of note, inhibitor screen positive [**2138-8-26**];
   unclear which Factor is being inhibited by review of OMR. Concern for
   DIC given anemia, decreasing platelet count, hyperbilirubinemia as
   well.
   - Suspect if inhibitor is playing role that high dose steroids, Cytoxan
   should be of benefit
   - Add on fibrinogen, haptoglobin, FDP, fractionate bilirubin
   - Monitor DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Expected leukocytosis with left-shift given high-dose
   steroids, although continues to rise. No clear evidence of infection -
   without productive cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. Patient
   did present with uncomplicated UTI and was treated 3-day course of
   ciprofloxacin.
   - f/u Sputum, blood, and urine cultures
   - f/u BAL results
   - Hold off on antibiotics, low threshold to start if she decompensates
   .
   #. Metabolic/respiratory alkalosis:  Likely secondary to tachypnea
   prior to intubation in addition to Bicitra (started for low bicarbonate
   secondary to renal dysfunction). Rate increased, Bicitra discontinued.
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed:  First and only episode of bleeding on [**2138-9-9**].
   Suspected to be diverticular vs. ischemic colitis given vasculitis.
   .
   #. Hypertension:  Blood pressure high in the 180s this AM
   .
   #. Anemia:  transfused 2 units pRBCs yesterday.  Several likely
   contributors, gastritis, DAH.  Also concern for DIC/hemolysis currently
   given hyperbilirubinemia, decreasing platelet count.
   - DIC labs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Smear to assess for schistocytes
   - Maintain hematocrit >25

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and glomerulonephritis. She was admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to fatigue and airway protection due to hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which correlates with the alveolar pattern seen on the chest X-ray. The patient also has an elevated white blood cell count, anemia, decreased platelet count, and hyperbilirubinemia. There is suspicion of pANCA vasculitis, possibly induced by hydralazine. The patient is currently on high-dose steroids and cyclophosphamide. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, requiring mechanical ventilation. There is concern for possible pneumonia or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) given the prolonged hospital course, immunosuppression, and worsening oxygen requirements.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and PTT, suggesting a coagulation disorder. This could be due to uremic platelets, coagulopathy associated with renal failure, or the presence of an inhibitor.
3. Glomerulonephritis: The patient has a history of glomerulonephritis and is suspected to have pANCA vasculitis, possibly induced by hydralazine. Steroid therapy and cyclophosphamide are"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis, now presenting with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and hemoptysis. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, coagulopathy, glomerulonephritis, and potential lower gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the diffuse alveolar hemorrhage seen on bronchoscopy and the bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, there is a possibility of developing ARDS. The patient is already intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Pulmonary embolism: Although there is no evidence of hemodynamic compromise, the patient has been bedbound for a prolonged period, which increases the risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
3. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): High-dose steroids have been given, which can increase the risk of opportunistic infections like PCP. The presence of bilateral patchy opacities on the chest X-ray raises suspicion for PCP.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastritis and hemoptysis, which could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding. The use of PPI IV is appropriate to reduce the risk of further bleeding.
5. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The elevated INR, decreased plate"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in context of renal
   failure --> pulmonary-renal syndrome.  At risk for ionf pna which is
   difficuklt to assess in thes etting of diffuse infiltrates.
   Continue vent support with ards net volumes, adjust mv to optimize pH,
   .  Follow abgs.
   DIFFUSE ALVEOLAR INFILTRATES -- attributable to diffuse alveolar
   hemorrhage, doubt pulmonary infection but diffiuclt to assess as
   above.  BAL performed to assess for infection, including PcP (less
   likely PcP as patient on steroids for <2 weeks and received AP
   pentamidine within past week).  Would hold on antibiotics at this time,
   unless obvious signs of infection/clinical decline (although may be
   modified by high-dose steroids).
   HEMOPTYSIS -- non-focal, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, in context of
   coagulopathy and renal failure (abnormal platelets)
   RENAL FAILURE/ p-ANCA POSITIVE  --Probable microscopic polyangiitis.
   Acute, possibly attributed to hydralazine induced cANCA poyyangiitis.
   Continue HD as planned.
   High dose solumedrol, cyclophosphamide --> monitor perpheral WBC
   counts.  Consider continuing plasmaphoresis -- discuss with Transfusion
   Medicine.
   GIB--possible gastrits. heme pos.  NG lavage neg.  [**Month (only) 11**] be swallowed
   hemoptysis.  Monitor for evidence for GI bleeding and continue ppi.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage --> maintain Hct
   >25. T and cross.
   COAGULOPATHY -- elevated PTT, possibly related to Lupus anticoagulant,
   but somewhat higher than expected.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent inactivation of
   clotting factor, or evolving DIC.
   repeat labs not elevated confusing.  Pos inhibitor screen.  continue to
   follow dic labs.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- declined by 50% since admission -->Plan d/c all
   heparin products, check HIT antibody.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   FLUIDS -- euvolemic intravascularly, although may be hypovolemic -->
   maintain balance or consider providing iv fluid boluses.  Would follow
   CVP once central line placed.
   Bradycardia--unclear etiology, ? exaggerated vagal tone. No obvious
   meds--? cyclophosphamide related given temporal relation.  Improves
   when sedation is decreased. Atropine.  Montior.  Check head CT. Follow
   neuro exam.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of pulmonary-renal syndrome, positive p-ANCA, and possible hydralazine-induced vasculitis. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and bradycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is complicated by DAH in the context of pulmonary-renal syndrome and p-ANCA positive vasculitis. This is further complicated by uremic platelets and thrombocytopenia. There is a possibility of pulmonary infection, but it is difficult to assess due to diffuse bilateral infiltrates. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been performed to rule out infection. Continuing ventilator support with ARDS net TVs and adjusting the mode to optimize pH is recommended. Steroids and cyclophosphamide therapy should be continued.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure associated with p-ANCA positive vasculitis, likely microscopic polyangiitis. Possibility of hydralazine-induced vasculitis cannot be ruled out. Continuous hemodialysis (HD) should be continued. Solumedrol and cyc"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of hemoptysis,
   improved from yesterday.
   #. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt changed to AC ARDS NET
   protocol due to b/l infiltrates on CXR and P/F ratio of 208. Pt on
   spectrum of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] to ARDS, much improved today. Tried on PSV 8/5 this AM
   and did well. Initially required urgent intubation on transfer
   secondary to fatigue and airway protection (given hemoptysis).
   Bronchoscopy showed DAH, which correlates with the alveolar pattern
   seen on CXR.  Included in the differential is vasculitis - Wegener's
   granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA positivity.
   Pneumonia is possible given prolonged hospital course,
   immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and leukocytosis. Given
   bilateral patchy opacities on high-dose steroids (on prednisone 40+mg
   PO daily since [**2138-8-30**]) and acutely increased O2 requirement, concern
   for PCP as well. No hemodynamic compromise to suggest pulmonary
   embolism, although patient has been bedbound for prolonged period.
   -Check ABG on PSV
 if ok, will wean PSV to [**5-20**]. Perhaps will do SBT
   today if pt tolerates PSV well with possible extubation today or
   tomorrow pending her clinical status and oxygenation.
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs
   - Given high-dose steroids, PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (inhaled
   pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close glucose monitoring
   - monitor hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  DAH seen on bronchoscopy.  Given history of gastritis,
   GI bleed also possible.  OG lavage without output now. Decreasing
   amounts of old blood and no new blood from ETT lavages. Hct stable.
   - check hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 for concern for active bleeding
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated. Dialysis yesterday for fluid overload
   per Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   -Possible plasmapheresis
 will f/u with blood bank
   - f/u renal recs and t/b re: next plan for dialysis.
   - Avoiding nephrotoxic agents
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR elevated on admission but 1.1 today with PTT
   33.1. Unlikely to be nutritional given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT
   suspected secondary to sample being drawn from heparin-dependent
   pheresis line, although still elevated to >150 on peripheral stick. Of
   note, inhibitor screen positive [**2138-8-26**]; unclear which Factor is being
   inhibited by review of OMR. DIC labs nl. Heparin products stopped and
   platelets now rising, concerning for HITT.
   - Check coags daily, add on DIC labs only if abnormal
   -f/u HITT antibody
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Expected leukocytosis given high-dose steroids,
   stable. No clear evidence of infection - without productive cough,
   abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. Patient did present with
   uncomplicated UTI and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - f/u Sputum, blood, and urine cultures
   - f/u BAL results
   - Hold off on antibiotics, low threshold to treat for VAP or HAP if she
   decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed:  First and only episode of bleeding on [**2138-9-9**].
   Suspected to be diverticular vs. ischemic colitis given vasculitis.
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.  Intracranial bleed unlikely as pt is
   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol, will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions yesterday. Several
   likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse for hematocrit >25
   .
   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt
s improvement
   -Will defer palliative care c/s at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of glomerulonephritis, hypertension, and acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on ARDS NET protocol due to bilateral infiltrates on CXR and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 208. The patient was initially requiring urgent intubation secondary to fatigue and airway protection due to hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), which correlates with the alveolar pattern seen on CXR. The differential diagnosis includes vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis), given pANCA positivity, pneumonia, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). No hemodynamic compromise to suggest pulmonary embolism.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has improved today and tried on pressure support ventilation (PSV) 8/5 this morning and did well. Goal is to wean PSV to 5-20 and possibly perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today if the patient tolerates PSV well, with possible extubation today or tomorrow pending her clinical status and oxygenation.
2. Hemoptysis: DAH seen on bronchoscopy. Given the history of gastritis, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed is also possible. OG lavage without output now. Decreasing amounts of old"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of hemoptysis
   #. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure:  Required urgent intubation on
   transfer secondary to fatigue and airway protection (given
   hemoptysis).  Bronchoscopy showed DAH, which correlates with the
   alveolar pattern seen on CXR.  Included in the differential is
   vasculitis - Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis
   given pANCA positivity.  No clear infiltrate is seen, although
   pneumonia is possible given prolonged hospital course,
   immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and worsening leukocytosis.
   Given bilateral patchy opacities on high-dose steroids (on prednisone
   40+mg PO daily since [**2138-8-30**]) and acutely increased O2 requirement,
   concern for PCP as well. No hemodynamic compromise to suggest pulmonary
   embolism, although patient has been bedbound for prolonged period.
   - vent set to be changed to ARDS protocol, P/F ratio 208 this AM
   - recheck ABG after vent changes
   - continue 40mg IV Q8 hours
   - Given high-dose steroids, PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (inhaled
   pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close glucose monitoring
   - continue cytoxan, consent given by daughter
   - monitor hematocrit TID
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  DAH seen on bronchoscopy.  Given history of gastritis,
   GI bleed also possible.  OG lavage this AM showed red blood.  Platelets
   98 this AM, but may have uremic platelets.  Pt is coagulopathic, as
   below.
   - check hematocrit TID
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 for concern for active bleeding
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated.
   - Steroid therapy, as above
   - continue cytoxan
   - f/u renal recs
   - Avoiding nephrotoxic agents
   - Plasmaphresis on hold at this point per blood bank
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR elevated on admission. Unlikely to be nutritional
   given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT suspected secondary to sample being
   drawn from heparin-dependent pheresis line, although still elevated to
   >150 on peripheral stick. Of note, inhibitor screen positive [**2138-8-26**];
   unclear which Factor is being inhibited by review of OMR. Concern for
   DIC given anemia, decreasing platelet count, hyperbilirubinemia as
   well.
   - Suspect if inhibitor is playing role that high dose steroids, Cytoxan
   should be of benefit
   - Add on fibrinogen, haptoglobin, FDP, fractionate bilirubin
   - DIC labs normal today, check coags daily, add on DIC labs only if
   abnormal
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Expected leukocytosis with left-shift given high-dose
   steroids, although continues to rise. No clear evidence of infection -
   without productive cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. Patient
   did present with uncomplicated UTI and was treated 3-day course of
   ciprofloxacin.
   - f/u Sputum, blood, and urine cultures
   - f/u BAL results
   - Hold off on antibiotics, low threshold to start if she decompensates
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed:  First and only episode of bleeding on [**2138-9-9**].
   Suspected to be diverticular vs. ischemic colitis given vasculitis.
   .
   #. Hypertension:  Blood pressure high in the 180s this AM in setting of
   bradycardia.  Given transient PTT of 150, consider intracranial bleed.
   Decrease of propofol resulted some improval of heart rate.
   - head CT today
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   .
   #. Anemia:  transfused 2 units pRBCs yesterday.  Several likely
   contributors, gastritis, DAH.  Also concern for DIC/hemolysis currently
   given hyperbilirubinemia, decreasing platelet count.
   - transfuse for hematocrit >25

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of renal pulmonary syndrome, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient's conditions include acute respiratory failure, pulmonary-renal syndrome, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in oxygenation but still requires ventilatory support. The underlying cause of respiratory failure is pulmonary-renal syndrome, which may be due to p-ANCA positive vasculitis, possibly induced by hydralazine. Monitoring and optimizing respiratory support, such as weaning off the ventilator, will be crucial.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be a result of the underlying vasculitis. Treatment includes hemodialysis and immunosuppressive therapy with steroids and cyclophosphamide. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient exhibits elevated PTT and a positive inhibitor screen, indicating the presence of a clotting factor inhibitor. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the coagulopathy, and appropriate management should be implemented to prevent further bleeding complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of renal pulmonary syndrome, acute renal failure (ARF), and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). She has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, antibiotics, steroids, and cytoxan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pulmonary-renal syndrome/p-ANCA vasculitis, uremic platelets, and thrombocytopenia. There is a concern for possible infection, but this needs to be ruled out through bronchoscopy and BAL.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has ARF, which is likely due to p-ANCA positive vasculitis, possibly microscopic polyangiitis or hydralazine-induced vasculitis. She is currently on hemodialysis and will continue with this treatment.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be related to the use of steroids. There is no obvious infectious etiology, but broad-spectrum antibiotics may be considered if there is clinical decline.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has GIB with heme-positive stool, possibly due to gastritis. NG lavage was negative, suggesting that the bleeding might be from swallowed hemoptysis. Monitoring for evidence of GI"

   to hydralazine induced p anca vasculitis.  Differential includes
   Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA
   positivity. Pneumonia (including PCP) is possible given prolonged
   hospital course, immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and
   leukocytosis. Initially required urgent intubation on transfer
   secondary to fatigue and airway protection (given hemoptysis).  Pt
   changed to AC ARDS NET protocol due to b/l infiltrates on CXR and P/F
   ratio of 208. Pt on spectrum of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] to ARDS, much improved today.
   Patient currently on CPAP/PSV 8/5 doing well. No hemodynamic compromise
   to suggest pulmonary embolism, although patient has been bedbound for
   prolonged period.
   -Check ABG on PSV
 if ok, will wean PSV to [**5-20**]. Perhaps will do SBT
   today if pt tolerates PSV well with possible extubation  tomorrow
   pending her clinical status and oxygenation.
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs
   - Given high-dose steroids, PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (inhaled
   pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close glucose monitoring
   - monitor hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off
   clotting factors. Given history of gastritis, GI bleed also possible.
   Decreasing amounts of old blood and no new blood from ETT lavages. Hct
   stable.
   - check hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 for concern for active bleeding
   - transfuse plasma
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated. Dialysis today for fluid overload per
   Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   - plasmapheresis this PM
 will f/u with blood bank
   - f/u renal recs and t/b re: next plan for dialysis.
   - Avoiding nephrotoxic agents
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR elevated on admission but 1.0 today with PTT
   33.1. Unlikely to be nutritional given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT
   suspected secondary to sample being drawn from heparin-dependent
   pheresis line, although still elevated to >150 on peripheral stick. Of
   note, inhibitor screen positive [**2138-8-26**]; unclear which Factor is being
   inhibited by review of OMR. DIC labs nl. Heparin products stopped and
   platelets now rising, concerning for HITT.
   - Check coags daily, add on DIC labs only if abnormal
   -f/u HIT antibody
   -d/c antiplatelet antibody
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Expected leukocytosis given high-dose steroids,
   stable. No clear evidence of infection - without productive cough,
   abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. Patient did present with
   uncomplicated UTI and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - f/u Sputum, blood, and urine cultures
   - f/u BAL results
   - Hold off on antibiotics, low threshold to treat for VAP or HAP if she
   decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed:  First and only episode of bleeding on [**2138-9-9**].
   Suspected to be diverticular vs. ischemic colitis given vasculitis.
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.  Intracranial bleed unlikely as pt is
   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol (SBP>160), will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions yesterday. Several
   likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse for hematocrit >25
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   .
   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and glomerulonephritis, who is currently in the ICU due to acute hypoxic respiratory failure caused by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) thought to be induced by hydralazine-associated p-ANCA vasculitis. The patient has been intubated and placed on CPAP/PSV 8/5, with an ABG showing pH 7.50, PaCO2 36, SaO2 82%, and Hct 28. The patient is expected to have a SBT today with possible extubation tomorrow, pending her clinical status and oxygenation.

The patient's medical history includes gastritis, which could potentially lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has also experienced hemoptysis, likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off clotting factors. There is a concern for active bleeding with a goal Hct >25.

The patient has glomerulonephritis, suspected to be hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. She underwent a renal biopsy on 9/1, which showed ""marked chronic vascular disease"" and surprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although pANCA level markedly elevated. The patient requires dialysis today for fluid overload per renal. The plan includes steroid therapy and cytoxan, as well as plasmapheresis this PM.

   CXR ([**2138-9-15**]): (my read) worsening bilateral pleural effusions
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of hemoptysis,
   improved from yesterday.
   #. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt changed to AC ARDS NET
   protocol due to b/l infiltrates on CXR and P/F ratio of 208. Pt on
   spectrum of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] to ARDS, much improved today. Tried on PSV 8/5 this AM
   and did well. Initially required urgent intubation on transfer
   secondary to fatigue and airway protection (given hemoptysis).
   Bronchoscopy showed DAH, which correlates with the alveolar pattern
   seen on CXR.  Included in the differential is vasculitis - Wegener's
   granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA positivity.
   Pneumonia is possible given prolonged hospital course,
   immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and leukocytosis. Given
   bilateral patchy opacities on high-dose steroids (on prednisone 40+mg
   PO daily since [**2138-8-30**]) and acutely increased O2 requirement, concern
   for PCP as well. No hemodynamic compromise to suggest pulmonary
   embolism, although patient has been bedbound for prolonged period.
   -Check ABG on PSV
 if ok, will wean PSV to [**5-20**]. Perhaps will do SBT
   today if pt tolerates PSV well with possible extubation today or
   tomorrow pending her clinical status and oxygenation.
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs
   - Given high-dose steroids, PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (inhaled
   pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close glucose monitoring
   - monitor hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  DAH seen on bronchoscopy.  Given history of gastritis,
   GI bleed also possible.  OG lavage without output now. Decreasing
   amounts of old blood and no new blood from ETT lavages. Hct stable.
   - check hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 for concern for active bleeding
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated. Dialysis yesterday for fluid overload
   per Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   -Possible plasmapheresis
 will f/u with blood bank
   - f/u renal recs and t/b re: next plan for dialysis.
   - Avoiding nephrotoxic agents
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR elevated on admission but 1.0 today with PTT
   33.1. Unlikely to be nutritional given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT
   suspected secondary to sample being drawn from heparin-dependent
   pheresis line, although still elevated to >150 on peripheral stick. Of
   note, inhibitor screen positive [**2138-8-26**]; unclear which Factor is being
   inhibited by review of OMR. DIC labs nl. Heparin products stopped and
   platelets now rising, concerning for HITT.
   - Check coags daily, add on DIC labs only if abnormal
   -f/u HITT antibody
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Expected leukocytosis given high-dose steroids,
   stable. No clear evidence of infection - without productive cough,
   abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. Patient did present with
   uncomplicated UTI and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - f/u Sputum, blood, and urine cultures
   - f/u BAL results
   - Hold off on antibiotics, low threshold to treat for VAP or HAP if she
   decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed:  First and only episode of bleeding on [**2138-9-9**].
   Suspected to be diverticular vs. ischemic colitis given vasculitis.
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.  Intracranial bleed unlikely as pt is
   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol, will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions yesterday. Several
   likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse for hematocrit >25
   .
   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt
s improvement
   -Will defer palliative care c/s at this time.

   Communication:  [**Doctor First Name 747**] (daughter, HCP), ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7905**]
   Code status:  FULL CODE
   Disposition:  ICU for now
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of glomerulonephritis, hypertension, and recent acute hypoxic respiratory failure. She was initially intubated due to fatigue and airway protection secondary to hemoptysis. Bronchoscopy showed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), which correlates with the alveolar pattern seen on chest X-ray. The differential diagnosis includes vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis) given pANCA positivity, pneumonia, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP).

The patient has been on high-dose steroids (prednisone 40 mg PO daily) since August 30th. There is concern for PCP given the prolonged hospital course, immunosuppression, and leukocytosis. No hemodynamic compromise suggests pulmonary embolism is unlikely, although the patient has been bedbound for a prolonged period.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has improved from yesterday and is now on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 0.4. She may undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today if she tolerates CPAP well, with possible extubation today or tomorrow pending her clinical status and oxygenation.
- Hemoptysis: DAH seen on bronchoscopy. There is also a possibility of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to a history of gastritis"

   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 for concern for active bleeding
   - transfuse plasma
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated. Dialysis yesterday for fluid overload
   per Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   -Possible plasmapheresis
 will f/u with blood bank
   - f/u renal recs and t/b re: next plan for dialysis.
   - Avoiding nephrotoxic agents
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR elevated on admission but 1.0 today with PTT
   33.1. Unlikely to be nutritional given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT
   suspected secondary to sample being drawn from heparin-dependent
   pheresis line, although still elevated to >150 on peripheral stick. Of
   note, inhibitor screen positive [**2138-8-26**]; unclear which Factor is being
   inhibited by review of OMR. DIC labs nl. Heparin products stopped and
   platelets now rising, concerning for HITT.
   - Check coags daily, add on DIC labs only if abnormal
   -f/u HITT antibody
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Expected leukocytosis given high-dose steroids,
   stable. No clear evidence of infection - without productive cough,
   abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. Patient did present with
   uncomplicated UTI and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - f/u Sputum, blood, and urine cultures
   - f/u BAL results
   - Hold off on antibiotics, low threshold to treat for VAP or HAP if she
   decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed:  First and only episode of bleeding on [**2138-9-9**].
   Suspected to be diverticular vs. ischemic colitis given vasculitis.
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.  Intracranial bleed unlikely as pt is
   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol (SBP>160), will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions yesterday. Several
   likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse for hematocrit >25
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   .
   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt
s improvement
   -Will defer palliative care c/s at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and glomerulonephritis. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), thought to be induced by hydralazine p-ANCA vasculitis. The patient required urgent intubation and has been on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 0.4. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 36, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 107, and Hct of 28%. She has been on high-dose steroids, cytoxan, and plasmapheresis. 

The patient's recent events include being on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 0.4, with ABG 7.50/36/82/29; may do SBT and see how she does- likely extubate tomorrow. She will undergo another round of plasma pheresis tomorrow afternoon and dialysis tomorrow AM. If she is hypertensive once off propofol, she may need an antihypertensive (she takes BB at home). Her hct goal is >25, and she has tested negative for PPD (placed upstairs for outpatient HD). She desatted this morning, FiO2 was increased to 0.06, and she coughed up blood clots this"

          Respiratory failure, acute, hypoxemic
          Pulmonary renal syndrome (DAH, ARF with p-anca + GN possibly
   [**2-17**] hydralazine-induced vasculitis)

          Coagulopathy
          Thrombocytopenia (improving)
          Bradycardia (improved)
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 DAH in context of pulmonary-renal
   syndrome/p-anca vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic
   polyangiitis vs hydral-induced vasculitis).  Further confounded by
   uremic platelets and thrombocytopenia.  Less likely pulmonary
   infection, but pna is difficult to assess in setting of diffuse b/l
   infiltrates.  S/p bronch with BAL  to r/o infection.
   --- F/u cx data.
   ---Continue PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (pentamidine)
   ---Hold on antibiotics at this time, unless obvious signs of
   infection/clinical decline.
   ---Continue steroids and cytoxan.  Rheum and renal input appreciated.
   Transfusion service input appreciated
will continue with
   plasmaphoresis.
   ---ABGs and imaging improving with fluid removal (HD) and treatment of
   underlying vasculitis, now on PS wean
   ---Confortable w/ continue with PS.  Now requiring increased Fio2 from
   prior.  Will reevaluate after phoresis/HD for SBT possible extubation
   though with recurrent bleeding from ET as major barrier to extugbation
   at this time.  Continue to reasses..
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE/p-anca + vasculitis-- Probable microscopic
   polyangiitis.  Possibly [**2-17**] hydralazine-induced vs wegeners.
   --Continue HD.
   --Continue solumedrol and cyclophosphamide, and  plasmaphoresis.
   # Leukocytosis
in setting of steroids.  No obvious infectious etiology.
   --Follow pending micro, empiric broad antibx in setting of clinical
   decline as above.
   # GIB with heme pos stool. Possible gastritis. NG lavage neg.  ? [**2-17**]
   swallowed hemoptysis.
   --Monitor for evidence for GI bleeding and continue ppi.  Maintain HCt
   > 25.
   # COAGULOPATHY
elevated PTT (lower on repeat check) with positive
   inhibitor screen.  [**Month (only) 11**] represent inactivation of clotting factor or
   evolving DIC given thrombocytopenia and elevated bili.
   --Immunosupression as above.
   --Without evidence of DIC
   # THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- declined by 50% since admission, now improving,
   --Remains off heparin products.
   --HIT antibody pending.  Need to clarify that this was sent.
   #HTN
consider resuming home antihtn regimen if remains of sedation
   (propofol) if elevated > 160.
   # GOALS OF CARE
continue to address goals of care and update family.
   Will talk with consulkting services further regarding prognosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, renal pulmonary syndrome, ARF/GN, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications including respiratory failure, pulmonary-renal syndrome, leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, and more. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with increased FiO2 requirement. The patient's condition is critical, and the medical team is working to address various issues including respiratory failure, pulmonary-renal syndrome, and other complications. Treatment includes hemodialysis, plasmapheresis, steroids, cytoxan, and other supportive measures. The patient's prognosis is uncertain, and the medical team is consulting with specialists to discuss the best course of action. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome: The patient has renal pulmonary syndrome with ARF/GN and DAH, which can lead to further respiratory distress and organ dysfunction.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, indicating an elevated white blood cell count, which may suggest an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to anemia, hypotension, and shock if"

   [p-anca + vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic
   polyangiitis vs hydral-induced vasculitis).  Further confounded by
   uremic platelets and thrombocytopenia.  Infection appears less likely,
   though pna is difficult to assess in setting of diffuse b/l infiltrates
   and with ongoing intubation and immunsupression she is at high risk for
   developing a VAP.  She is s/p bronch with BAL to r/o initial infection
   and we continue to follow imaging and clinical status closely. Although
   yesterday we were hopeful that we were moving toward extubation, at
   present barriers to extubation include the need for increased FIO2
   (large A-a gradient) and recurrent bleeding from ET sx.
   Agree with plan to continue PS ventilation, adjusting settings by abg
   (will tolerate paO2 > 60).  Will continue to reassess for
   SBT/extubation after HD and phoresis. We continue cytoxan, steroids and
   phoresis with rheum, renal, and transfusion service input appreciated.
   Will continue PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (pentamidine).   She continues with HD
   for clearance and volume removal.
   She continues to have an impressive leukocytosis, in  the setting of
   steroids, with no obvious infectious etiology. We follow pending micro,
   and will initiate empiric broad antibx in setting of clinical decline
   as above.
   Pt had elevated PTT with + inhibitor screen, w/o evidence of DIC.
   Phoresis also impacting labs.  Immunsupression treatment should help,
   and we continue to monitor.
   Pt with profound thrombocytopenia with > 50% decline during course, now
   improving.  We continue to hold all heparin products.
   HIT antibody is pending (Need to clarify that this was actually sent.)
   H/o htn as baseline.  We are holding meds while sedated and undergoing
   HD.  Continue to assess for restarting with conservative BP parameters.
   Will continue to update family and address goals of care, working with
   renal/rheum services to provide information regarding prognosis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with acute respiratory failure due to pulmonary-renal syndrome (p-ANCA + vasculitis). She is also experiencing dialysis-associated hypotension, uremic platelets, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has a history of hypertension, anemia, coagulopathy, and leukocytosis. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 165/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature of 36.7°C. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate, LDH, and D-dimer levels. Imaging reveals slight increases in effusions and aspergilli on both sides.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying pulmonary-renal syndrome is not effectively managed.
2. Infection: Despite negative microbiology results, the patient is at high risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and immunosuppression.
3. Bleeding: Recurrent bleeding from the endotracheal tube suggests a risk of further hemorrhage.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's profound"

Blood culture from [**9-12**]: NGT
CXR ([**9-16**]): my read: essentially unchaged from yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, thought to be hydralazine p-ANCA induced
   vasculitis.
   #. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: Most likely due to DAH secondary
   to hydralazine induced p anca vasculitis.  Differential includes
   Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA
   positivity. Pneumonia (including PCP) is possible given prolonged
   hospital course, immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and
   leukocytosis. Initially required urgent intubation on transfer
   secondary to fatigue and airway protection (given hemoptysis).  Pt
   changed to AC ARDS NET protocol due to b/l infiltrates on CXR and P/F
   ratio of 208. Pt on spectrum of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] to ARDS, much improved today.
   Patient currently on CPAP/PSV 8/5 doing well. No hemodynamic compromise
   to suggest pulmonary embolism, although patient has been bedbound for
   prolonged period.
   - wean FiO2 to 50%, check ABG.
   - if ABG ok, then will try SBT today. If not able to wean today, will
   attempt tomorrow pending her clinical status and oxygenation.
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs
   - Given high-dose steroids, PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (inhaled
   pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close glucose monitoring
   - monitor hematocrit daily
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off
   clotting factors. Given history of gastritis, GI bleed also possible.
   Decreasing amounts of old blood and no new blood from ETT lavages. Hct
   stable.
   - check hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 for concern for active bleeding
   - transfuse plasma
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated. Dialysis today for fluid overload per
   Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   - continue plasmapheresis
 2 more sessions
   - continue dialysis
   - get tunneled line today by IR
   - f/u renal recs
   - Avoiding nephrotoxic agents
   .
   # Positive HIT antibody: Given positive HIT, pt has risk of thrombosis,
   especially given her systemic inflammation in the setting of
   vasculitis.
   -  consider argatroban
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: question if dialysate containes more bicarb than
   usual.
   - touch base with renal
   - continue to monitor acid-base status
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  resolved. INR elevated on admission. Unlikely to be
   nutritional given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT suspected secondary to
   sample being drawn from heparin-dependent pheresis line, although still
   elevated to >150 on peripheral stick. Of note, inhibitor screen
   positive [**2138-8-26**]; unclear which Factor is being inhibited by review of
   OMR. DIC labs nl. Heparin products stopped and platelets now rising,
   concerning for HITT.
   - Check coags daily, add on DIC labs only if abnormal
   - f/u HIT antibody
   -d/c antiplatelet antibody
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Expected leukocytosis given high-dose steroids,
   stable. No clear evidence of infection - without productive cough,
   abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. Patient did present with
   uncomplicated UTI and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - f/u Sputum, blood, and urine cultures
   - f/u BAL results
   - Hold off on antibiotics, low threshold to treat for VAP or HAP if she
   decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed:  First and only episode of bleeding on [**2138-9-9**]. Most
   likely in the setting of swallowing coughed-up blood. Suspected to be
   diverticular vs. ischemic colitis given vasculitis.
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.  Intracranial bleed unlikely as pt is
   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol (SBP>160), will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions for the past few days.
   Several likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse if hematocrit <25
   - daily CBC
   .
   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt
s improvement
   -Will defer palliative care c/s at this time.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient also has a positive pANCA, which suggests a possible diagnosis of hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis or other types of vasculitis such as Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis.

The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV 8/5 and is doing well without any hemodynamic compromise, suggesting that pulmonary embolism is less likely. However, the patient has been bedbound for a prolonged period, so it is important to monitor for any signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and consider prophylactic measures such as pneumoboots.

The patient's recent laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.7, which could be due to high-dose steroid therapy. The patient's platelet count is also decreasing, which may be related to the positive HIT antibody detected in the lab results.

The patient's coagulopathy has resolved, but there is a history of an inhibitor screen positive on [**2138-8-26**], indicating a potential coagulation disorder. The patient's INR is elevated, and the PTT is still above normal levels, suggesting ongoing coagulation issues.

Blood culture from [**9-12**]: NGT

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, thought to be hydralazine p-ANCA induced
   vasculitis.
   #. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: Most likely due to DAH secondary
   to hydralazine induced p anca vasculitis.  Differential includes
   Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA
   positivity. Pneumonia (including PCP) is possible given prolonged
   hospital course, immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and
   leukocytosis. Initially required urgent intubation on transfer
   secondary to fatigue and airway protection (given hemoptysis).  Pt
   changed to AC ARDS NET protocol due to b/l infiltrates on CXR and P/F
   ratio of 208. Pt on spectrum of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] to ARDS, much improved today.
   Patient currently on CPAP/PSV 8/5 doing well. No hemodynamic compromise
   to suggest pulmonary embolism, although patient has been bedbound for
   prolonged period.
   -Check ABG on PSV
 if ok, will wean PSV to [**5-20**]. Perhaps will do SBT
   today if pt tolerates PSV well with possible extubation  tomorrow
   pending her clinical status and oxygenation.
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs
   - Given high-dose steroids, PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (inhaled
   pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close glucose monitoring
   - monitor hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off
   clotting factors. Given history of gastritis, GI bleed also possible.
   Decreasing amounts of old blood and no new blood from ETT lavages. Hct
   stable.
   - check hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 for concern for active bleeding
   - transfuse plasma
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated. Dialysis today for fluid overload per
   Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   - plasmapheresis this PM
 will f/u with blood bank
   - f/u renal recs and t/b re: next plan for dialysis.
   - Avoiding nephrotoxic agents
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR elevated on admission but 1.0 today with PTT
   33.1. Unlikely to be nutritional given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT
   suspected secondary to sample being drawn from heparin-dependent
   pheresis line, although still elevated to >150 on peripheral stick. Of
   note, inhibitor screen positive [**2138-8-26**]; unclear which Factor is being
   inhibited by review of OMR. DIC labs nl. Heparin products stopped and
   platelets now rising, concerning for HITT.
   - Check coags daily, add on DIC labs only if abnormal
   -f/u HIT antibody
   -d/c antiplatelet antibody
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Expected leukocytosis given high-dose steroids,
   stable. No clear evidence of infection - without productive cough,
   abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. Patient did present with
   uncomplicated UTI and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - f/u Sputum, blood, and urine cultures
   - f/u BAL results
   - Hold off on antibiotics, low threshold to treat for VAP or HAP if she
   decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed:  First and only episode of bleeding on [**2138-9-9**].
   Suspected to be diverticular vs. ischemic colitis given vasculitis.
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.  Intracranial bleed unlikely as pt is
   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol (SBP>160), will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions yesterday. Several
   likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse for hematocrit >25
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   .
   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt
s improvement
   -Will defer palliative care c/s at this time.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, admitted for glomerulonephritis and now experiencing acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, suspected to be hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. The patient required urgent intubation due to fatigue and airway protection. She is currently on CPAP/PSV 8/5 and showing improvement. The patient has a variety of medical complications including hemoptysis, glomerulonephritis, coagulopathy, leukocytosis, lower GI bleed, hypertension, and anemia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing this complication, which is likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. Pneumonia, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), is also a possibility given the prolonged hospital course and immunosuppression with steroid therapy.

2. Hemoptysis: This is likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off clotting factors. Other possible causes include GI bleed, especially considering the patient's history of gastritis.

3. Glomerulonephritis: Suspected to be hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. The patient had a renal biopsy showing ""marked chronic"

Blood culture from [**9-12**]: NGT
CXR ([**9-16**]): my read: essentially unchaged from yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, thought to be hydralazine p-ANCA induced
   vasculitis.
   #. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: Most likely due to DAH secondary
   to hydralazine induced p anca vasculitis.  Differential includes
   Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA
   positivity. Pneumonia (including PCP) is possible given prolonged
   hospital course, immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and
   leukocytosis. Initially required urgent intubation on transfer
   secondary to fatigue and airway protection (given hemoptysis).  Pt
   changed to AC ARDS NET protocol due to b/l infiltrates on CXR and P/F
   ratio of 208. Pt on spectrum of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] to ARDS, much improved today.
   Patient currently on CPAP/PSV 8/5 doing well. No hemodynamic compromise
   to suggest pulmonary embolism, although patient has been bedbound for
   prolonged period.
   -Check ABG on PSV
 if ok, will wean PSV to [**5-20**]. Perhaps will do SBT
   today if pt tolerates PSV well with possible extubation  tomorrow
   pending her clinical status and oxygenation.
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs
   - Given high-dose steroids, PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (inhaled
   pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close glucose monitoring
   - monitor hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off
   clotting factors. Given history of gastritis, GI bleed also possible.
   Decreasing amounts of old blood and no new blood from ETT lavages. Hct
   stable.
   - check hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 for concern for active bleeding
   - transfuse plasma
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated. Dialysis today for fluid overload per
   Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   - plasmapheresis this PM
 will f/u with blood bank
   - f/u renal recs and t/b re: next plan for dialysis.
   - Avoiding nephrotoxic agents
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  INR elevated on admission but 1.0 today with PTT
   33.1. Unlikely to be nutritional given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT
   suspected secondary to sample being drawn from heparin-dependent
   pheresis line, although still elevated to >150 on peripheral stick. Of
   note, inhibitor screen positive [**2138-8-26**]; unclear which Factor is being
   inhibited by review of OMR. DIC labs nl. Heparin products stopped and
   platelets now rising, concerning for HITT.
   - Check coags daily, add on DIC labs only if abnormal
   -f/u HIT antibody
   -d/c antiplatelet antibody
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Expected leukocytosis given high-dose steroids,
   stable. No clear evidence of infection - without productive cough,
   abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria. Patient did present with
   uncomplicated UTI and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - f/u Sputum, blood, and urine cultures
   - f/u BAL results
   - Hold off on antibiotics, low threshold to treat for VAP or HAP if she
   decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed:  First and only episode of bleeding on [**2138-9-9**].
   Suspected to be diverticular vs. ischemic colitis given vasculitis.
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.  Intracranial bleed unlikely as pt is
   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol (SBP>160), will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions yesterday. Several
   likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse for hematocrit >25
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   .
   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt
s improvement
   -Will defer palliative care c/s at this time.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and glomerulonephritis. She was admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which is believed to be secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) caused by hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. The patient also has anemia, leukocytosis, coagulopathy, lower gastrointestinal bleed, and hypertension.

The patient underwent plasmapheresis on [**9-15**] with 9 bags of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Rheumatology recommendations include increasing cyclophosphamide (be wary of hemorrhagic cystitis and leukopenia). The patient restarted tube feeds, with plans to hold at midnight in case of extubation. PF4 antibody has been ordered.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 149/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 60% FiO2. She is on CPAP/PSV 8/5 and is doing well without any hemodynamic compromise suggesting pulmonary embolism. The patient's ABG on PSV is pending, and she may be weaned to 5-20 PSV with a possible spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today"

   likely, though pna is difficult to assess in setting of diffuse b/l
   infiltrates and with ongoing intubation and immunsupression she is at
   high risk for developing a VAP.  She is s/p bronch with BAL to r/o
   initial infection and we continue to follow imaging and clinical status
   closely. Although yesterday we were hopeful that we were moving toward
   extubation, at present barriers to extubation include the need for
   increased FIO2 (large A-a gradient) and recurrent bleeding from ET sx.
   Agree with plan to continue PS ventilation, will reasses on 40% fio2
   and consider moving toward SBT.  Pt still with frequent sx needs which
   may be ongoing barrier to extubatiuon. We continue cytoxan, steroids
   and phoresis with rheum, renal, and transfusion service input
   appreciated.  Will continue PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (pentamidine).   She
   continues with HD for clearance and volume removal.  Plan for tunnel HD

   [**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ ARF/GN in setting of pulm-renal syndrome (p-anca +
   vasculitis) c/b acute hypoxemic resp failure [**2-17**] DAH.
    ISSUES INCLUDE:
          Respiratory failure, acute, hypoxemic
          Pulmonary renal syndrome (DAH, ARF, p-anca + GN felt [**2-17**]
   hydralazine-induced vasculitis)

              HTN
   Acute resp failure [**2-17**] DAH in context of pulmonary-renal syndrome
   [p-anca + vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic
   polyangiitis vs hydral-induced vasculitis).  Further confounded by
   uremic platelets and thrombocytopenia. Also with component of fluid
   o/l/effusions in setting of renal failure. Infection appears less
   likely, though pna is difficult to assess in setting of diffuse b/l
   infiltrates and with ongoing intubation and immunsupression she is at
   high risk for developing a VAP.  She is s/p bronch with BAL to r/o
   initial infection and we continue to follow imaging and clinical status
   closely.  She is doing well on little vent support, but at present the
   main barriers to extubation are her poor cough and frequent sx
   requirements.
   Agree with plan to continue PS ventilation.  Recheck abg on 40% fio2
   and consider moving toward SBT as we reevaluate her suction needs. We
   continue cytoxan, steroids and phoresis with rheum, renal, and
   transfusion service input appreciated.  Will continue PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**]
   (pentamidine).   She continues with HD for clearance and volume
   removal.  Tunnel HD catheter scheduled for IR placement today.  Has
   metabolic alkalosis and appears comfortable on vent.  Likely [**2-17**]
   dialysate with HD.  Will touch base with renal regarding changes to
   optimize Ph.
   She continues to have a leukocytosis (down slightly), in the setting of
   steroids, with no obvious infectious etiology. We follow pending micro,
   and will initiate empiric broad antibx in setting of clinical decline
   as above or overt change in secretions or imaging.
   Her plts have improved after significant drop, concerning for HIT. We
   continue to hold all heparin products.  HIT antibody pending.
   H/o htn at baseline.  We are holding meds while sedated and undergoing
   HD.  Continue to assess for restarting with conservative BP
   parameters.
   Will continue to update family and address goals of care, working with
   renal/rheum services to provide information regarding prognosis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with pulmonary-renal syndrome, respiratory failure, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and p-ANCA positive vasculitis. She has a history of hypertension, anemia, leukocytosis, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and fluid overload. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with PS ventilation mode. She has been receiving plasmapheresis, increased dose of cytoxin, and antibiotics. The patient's condition is complicated by potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the need for hemodialysis (HD) for clearance and volume removal. She also has metabolic alkalosis and her platelets have improved after a significant drop, concerning for HIT. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of VAP, further decline in renal function, bleeding complications due to coagulopathy, and potential infections due to immunosuppression."

   changed to AC ARDS NET protocol due to b/l infiltrates on CXR and P/F
   ratio of 208. Pt on spectrum of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] to ARDS, much improved today.
   Patient currently on CPAP/PSV 8/5 doing well. No hemodynamic compromise
   to suggest pulmonary embolism, although patient has been bedbound for
   prolonged period.
   - wean FiO2 to 50%, check ABG.
   - if ABG ok, then will try SBT today. If not able to wean today, will
   attempt tomorrow pending her clinical status and oxygenation.
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs
   - Given high-dose steroids, PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (inhaled

   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic

   uncomplicated UTI and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - f/u Sputum, blood, and urine cultures
   - f/u BAL results
   - Hold off on antibiotics, low threshold to treat for VAP or HAP if she
   decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed:  First and only episode of bleeding on [**2138-9-9**]. Most
   likely in the setting of swallowing coughed-up blood. Suspected to be
   diverticular vs. ischemic colitis given vasculitis.
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.  Intracranial bleed unlikely as pt is
   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol (SBP>160), will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions for the past few days.
   Several likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse if hematocrit <25
   - daily CBC
   .
   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt
s improvement
   -Will defer palliative care c/s at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of glomerulonephritis, admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) secondary to hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. She is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV 8/5 and showing improvement. She has positive HIT antibodies, renal insufficiency requiring dialysis, anemia, leukocytosis, and potential metabolic alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to DAH secondary to hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. Pneumonia, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), is also a possibility given her prolonged hospital course, immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and leukocytosis.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient may have metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to the dialysate containing more bicarbonate than usual.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient initially had an elevated INR and PTT, suggesting coagulopathy. However, this has resolved, and she is now showing signs of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is expected with high-dose steroids. However, there is no clear evidence"

   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol (SBP>160), will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions for the past few days.
   Several likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse if hematocrit <25
   - daily CBC
   .
   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt
s improvement
   -Will defer palliative care c/s at this time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and glomerulonephritis. She was admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in the context of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), which is thought to be hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. 

The patient's current condition is stable, with improved oxygenation and reduced secretions. She is on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 40% and doing well. The plan is to attempt a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today and consider extubation later if successful. 

The patient has positive HIT antibodies and is at increased risk for thrombosis. However, she is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to ongoing DAH. 

Her metabolic alkalosis is being monitored, and coagulopathy has resolved. 

There are multiple ongoing concerns and plans for the patient, including ongoing treatment for glomerulonephritis, monitoring for signs of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, close glucose monitoring, and follow-up with rheumatology and renal teams. 

Overall, the patient's condition has improved, and there are plans for potential extubation and further management of her underlying conditions."

   vent support,and we were able to wean FIo2 to 40%.  Her secretions are
   decreasing and A-a gradient is somewhat better.
   Agree with plan to continue PS ventilation. Will plan on SBT later this
   mornign after tunnel line palcement with hope for extubation.  We
   continue cytoxan, steroids and phoresis with rheum, renal, and
   transfusion service input appreciated.  Will continue PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**]
   (pentamidine).   She continues with HD for clearance and volume
   removal.  Tunnel HD catheter scheduled for IR placement today.  Has
   metabolic alkalosis and appears comfortable on vent.  Likely [**2-17**]
   dialysate with HD.  Will touch base with renal regarding changes to
   optimize Ph.
   She continues to have a leukocytosis though wbc is decreasing.  SUspect
   this is related to cytoxan.  Will continue to follow pending micro, and
   will initiate empiric broad antibx in setting of clinical decline as
   above or overt change in secretions or imaging.
   Her HIT ab returned pos.  Given DAH she is not a current candidate for
   argatroban.  Will monior closely for development of clot. We continue
   to hold all heparin products.
   H/o htn at baseline.  We are holding meds while sedated and undergoing
   HD.  Continue to assess for restarting with conservative BP
   parameters.
   Glargine added to SSI for hyperglycemia in setting of steroids.
   Will continue to update family and address goals of care, working with
   renal/rheum services to provide information regarding prognosis.

- The patient has experienced acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 84 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 139/64 mmHg to 179/75 mmHg. Respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 98%.
- The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation support with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 311 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer levels. Platelet count is low, and there is evidence of metabolic alkalosis.
- Imaging shows effusions in both lungs, with some improvement in clearing.
- The patient has a positive HIT antibody, indicating a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) diagnosis. Heparin products are being withheld.
- The patient's medical history includes hypertension, allergies to sulfonamides, macrodantin,"

   decreasing and A-a gradient is improving.
   Agree with plan for SBT later today after tunnel HD catheter placement
   with hope for extubation.  We continue cytoxan, steroids and phoresis
   with rheum, renal, and transfusion service input appreciated.  Will
   continue PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (pentamidine).   She continues with HD for
   clearance and volume removal. Has metabolic alkalosis  [**2-17**] HD, renal
   adjusting dialysate to optimize Ph.
   She continues to have a leukocytosis though wbc is now decreasing.
   Suspect this is related to cytoxan.  Will continue to follow pending
   micro, and initiate empiric broad antibx in setting of clinical decline
   or overt change in secretions or imaging.
   Her HIT ab returned pos.  Given DAH she is not a candidate for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with pulmonary-renal syndrome, acute respiratory failure, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. She has a history of p-ANCA positive vasculitis and is currently on hemodialysis for renal failure. The patient's condition includes respiratory failure, hypoxemia, leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia (HIT+), metabolic alkalosis, hypertension, and fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support are necessary.
2. Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome: The patient's underlying condition may progress, leading to worsening renal function and pulmonary involvement.
3. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage: Continued bleeding in the lungs can cause hypoxemia and respiratory distress. Frequent suctioning of secretions and monitoring of oxygenation parameters are required.
4. Thrombocytopenia (HIT+): The patient's platelet count is low, and she has tested positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). This condition increases the risk of thrombosis. Close monitoring for signs of thrombosis is essential, and all heparin products should be held.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which may require adjustment of dialysate"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, thought to be secondary to hydralazine p-ANCA
   induced vasculitis.
   #. Acute respiratory failure: Most likely due to DAH secondary to
   pulmonary-renal syndrome (positive p anca, vasculitis) suspected to be
   hydralazine induced p anca vasculitis.  Differential also includes
   Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA
   positivity.  Pneumonia (including PCP) is possible given prolonged
   hospital course, immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and
   leukocytosis.  Patient successfully extubated this AM.
   - follow up ABG
   - continue nebs
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs
   - continue plasmapharesis per renal, last session Friday
   - HD for volume removal
   - continue PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close
   glucose monitoring
   - monitor hematocrit daily
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   - PT, Speech and swallow ordered.
   - PICC consult and then d/c CVL
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off
   clotting factors. Given history of gastritis, GI bleed also possible.
   Decreasing amounts of old blood and no new blood from ETT lavages. Hct
   stable.
   - hematocrit stable
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 for concern for active bleeding
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated. Dialysis today for fluid overload per
   Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   - continue plasmapheresis
 1 more session on Friday
   - continue HD
   - tunneled line in place
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Possible UTI:  wbcs, bacteria, and few yeast seen on u/a.  Will await
   urine culture.  Consider starting diflucan for yeasts.
   # Positive HIT antibody: Given positive HIT, pt has risk of thrombosis,
   especially given her systemic inflammation in the setting of
   vasculitis.
   - although at inc risk for thrombosis, not a candidate for
   anti-coagulation given DAH
   - monitor closely for signs of DVT/PE
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: renal decreasing bicarb conc in diasylate
   - continue to monitor acid-base status
   ..
   #. Leukocytosis:  Resolved. Patient did present with uncomplicated UTI
   and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - Hold off on antibiotics for now, low threshold to treat for VAP or
   HAP if she decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   - f/u sputum cx
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.
   - BP elevated (SBP>180), labetolol restarted PRN > 180.
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions for the past few days.
   Several likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, thought to be secondary to hydralazine p-ANCA
   induced vasculitis.
   #. Acute respiratory failure: Most likely due to DAH secondary to
   pulmonary-renal syndrome (positive p anca, vasculitis) suspected to be
   hydralazine induced p anca vasculitis.  Differential also includes
   Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA
   positivity.  Pneumonia (including PCP) is possible given prolonged
   hospital course, immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and
   leukocytosis. Initially required urgent intubation on transfer
   secondary to fatigue and airway protection (given hemoptysis).  Pt
   changed to AC ARDS NET protocol due to b/l infiltrates on CXR and P/F
   ratio of 208. Pt on spectrum of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] to ARDS, much improved today.
   Patient currently on CPAP/PSV 5/5 FiO2 40% doing well. No hemodynamic
   compromise to suggest pulmonary embolism, although patient has been
   bedbound for prolonged period and is now at increased risk for
   thrombosis bc of HIT.
   - follow up ABG
   -secretions appear to be continuing
   - will try SBT today and possible extubation later today after
   procedure
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs
   - continue PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close
   glucose monitoring
   - monitor hematocrit daily
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   - PT, Speech and swallow ordered.
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off
   clotting factors. Given history of gastritis, GI bleed also possible.
   Decreasing amounts of old blood and no new blood from ETT lavages. Hct
   stable.
   - check hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 for concern for active bleeding
   - transfuse plasma
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated. Dialysis today for fluid overload per
   Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   - continue plasmapheresis
 1 more session on Friday
   - continue HD
   - get tunneled line yesterday by IR
   - f/u renal recs
   - Avoiding nephrotoxic agents

   # Possible UTI:  wbcs, bacteria, and few yeast seen on u/a.  Will await
   urine culture.  Consider starting diflucan for yeasts.
   # Positive HIT antibody: Given positive HIT, pt has risk of thrombosis,
   especially given her systemic inflammation in the setting of
   vasculitis.
   - although at inc risk for thrombosis, not a candidate for
   anti-coagulation given DAH
   - monitor closely for signs of DVT/PE
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: renal decreasing bicarb conc in diasylate
   - continue to monitor acid-base status
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  resolved. INR elevated on admission. Unlikely to be
   nutritional given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT suspected secondary to
   sample being drawn from heparin-dependent pheresis line, although still
   elevated to >150 on peripheral stick. Of note, inhibitor screen
   positive [**2138-8-26**]; unclear which Factor is being inhibited by review of
   OMR. DIC labs nl. HIT Ab positive.
   - Check coags daily, add on DIC labs only if abnormal
   - is positive for HIT antibody
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Resolved. Patient did present with uncomplicated UTI
   and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - Hold off on antibiotics for now, low threshold to treat for VAP or
   HAP if she decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   - f/u sputum cx
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.  Intracranial bleed unlikely as pt is
   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol (SBP>160), will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions for the past few days.
   Several likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse if hematocrit <25
   - daily CBC
   .
   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt
s improvement
   -Will defer palliative care c/s at this time.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and glomerulonephritis. She has been admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), which is suspected to be secondary to hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. The patient required urgent intubation and is currently on CPAP/PSV, FiO2 40%, doing well.

The patient also has hemoptysis, likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off clotting factors. There is a possibility of GI bleed given her history of gastritis. The hematocrit is stable, and the goal is to maintain it above 25 for concern for active bleeding. The patient is receiving PPI IV and high-dose steroids.

The patient has glomerulonephritis, suspected to be hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis. She had a renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] showing marked chronic vascular disease and no evidence of vasculitis, although pANCA levels are markedly elevated. The patient is undergoing dialysis for fluid overload per Renal.

The patient also has a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) with WBCs, bacteria, and few yeast seen on urinalysis. A urine culture is pending, and consideration is being given to starting diflucan for"

   #. Leukocytosis:  Resolved. Patient did present with uncomplicated UTI
   and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - Hold off on antibiotics for now, low threshold to treat for VAP or
   HAP if she decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   - f/u sputum cx
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.  Intracranial bleed unlikely as pt is
   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol (SBP>160), will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions for the past few days.
   Several likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse if hematocrit <25
   - daily CBC

   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt
s improvement
   -Will defer palliative care c/s at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, currently admitted with glomerulonephritis and acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The DAH is suspected to be secondary to hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. The patient also has a positive pANCA, making differential diagnoses of Wegener's granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis possible. She is currently on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 40% and showing improvement. Other conditions include hemoptysis, glomerulonephritis, possible UTI, metabolic alkalosis, coagulopathy, leukocytosis, hypertension, anemia, and positive HIT antibody.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further due to ongoing DAH or development of pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's prolonged bedbound status and positive HIT antibody, there is an increased risk of thrombosis, including pulmonary embolism.
3. GI bleed: Hemoptysis could be due to DAH or gastritis-induced GI bleed, which may require close monitoring and intervention.
4. UTI: The presence of WBCs, bacteria, and yeast in the urine analysis suggests a possible urinary tract infection, which should be treated appropriately.
5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's renal dialysis may"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, thought to be secondary to hydralazine p-ANCA
   induced vasculitis.
   #. Acute respiratory failure: Most likely due to DAH secondary to
   pulmonary-renal syndrome (positive p anca, vasculitis) suspected to be
   hydralazine induced p anca vasculitis.  Differential also includes
   Wegener's granulomatosis vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA
   positivity.  Pneumonia (including PCP) is possible given prolonged
   hospital course, immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and
   leukocytosis. Initially required urgent intubation on transfer
   secondary to fatigue and airway protection (given hemoptysis).  Pt
   changed to AC ARDS NET protocol due to b/l infiltrates on CXR and P/F
   ratio of 208. Pt on spectrum of [**Doctor Last Name 2**] to ARDS, much improved today.
   Patient currently on CPAP/PSV 5/5 FiO2 40% doing well. No hemodynamic
   compromise to suggest pulmonary embolism, although patient has been
   bedbound for prolonged period and is now at increased risk for
   thrombosis bc of HIT.
   -secretions appear to be continuing
   - will try SBT today and possible extubation later today after
   procedure
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs
   - continue PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (pentamidine given [**2138-9-6**]), close
   glucose monitoring
   - monitor hematocrit daily
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off
   clotting factors. Given history of gastritis, GI bleed also possible.
   Decreasing amounts of old blood and no new blood from ETT lavages. Hct
   stable.
   - check hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - PPI IV given known gastritis, high-dose steroids
   - Goal hct>25 for concern for active bleeding
   - transfuse plasma
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Suspected hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis.
   Patient with renal biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic
   vascular disease' and suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although
   pANCA level markedly elevated. Dialysis today for fluid overload per
   Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   - continue plasmapheresis
 1 more session on Friday
   - continue HD
   - get tunneled line yesterday by IR
   - f/u renal recs
   - Avoiding nephrotoxic agents
   .
   # Positive HIT antibody: Given positive HIT, pt has risk of thrombosis,
   especially given her systemic inflammation in the setting of
   vasculitis.
   - although at inc risk for thrombosis, not a candidate for
   anti-coagulation given DAH
   - monitor closely for signs of DVT/PE
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: renal decreasing bicarb conc in diasylate
   - continue to monitor acid-base status
   .
   #. Coagulopathy:  resolved. INR elevated on admission. Unlikely to be
   nutritional given albumin 4.1. Elevated PTT suspected secondary to
   sample being drawn from heparin-dependent pheresis line, although still
   elevated to >150 on peripheral stick. Of note, inhibitor screen
   positive [**2138-8-26**]; unclear which Factor is being inhibited by review of
   OMR. DIC labs nl. HIT Ab positive.
   - Check coags daily, add on DIC labs only if abnormal
   - is positive for HIT antibody
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Resolved. Patient did present with uncomplicated UTI
   and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - Hold off on antibiotics for now, low threshold to treat for VAP or
   HAP if she decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR
   - f/u sputum cx
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.  Intracranial bleed unlikely as pt is
   responsive and head CT deferred. Decrease of propofol resulted some
   improvement of heart rate with increase as pt was previously
   bradycardic.
   - wean propofol as tolerated
   -if BP elevated off propofol (SBP>160), will restart home labetalol
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions for the past few days.
   Several likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable.
   - transfuse if hematocrit <25
   - daily CBC
   .
   # Goals for care
 Daughter would like mother to be healthy enough to
   be extubated and go home. She understand mother is elderly. Yesterday,
   situation was more critical but pt is much improved on exam today.
   -Attempt to extubate today or tomorrow
   -Will t/b with family re: goals of care and pt
s improvement
   -Will defer palliative care c/s at this time.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition:

- The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) and pheresis, which led to hypertension but was later managed.
- An arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed a pH of 7.54, indicating alkalosis. The pCO2 was 39, which is within the normal range, while the pO2 was 107, indicating adequate oxygenation. The HCO3 level was 34, suggesting metabolic alkalosis.
- The physician decided to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubate the patient in the morning due to it being too late in the day.
- Tube feeds were held overnight for extubation.
- Renal recommendations include decreasing HCO3 to 30 during HD today and administering epo 4000U with HD. Additionally, AlOH TID x 2 days is prescribed because of elevated pH.
- Rheumatology recommendations involve continuing Cytoxan and steroids, as they usually take 7-10 days before leukopenia is noted.
- Blood sugars have been in the low 150-200 range, so 5U Lantus qhs was added.
- Blood pressures have been in the 135-155 range, so no home labetalol is needed.
- The patient has allergies to sulfonamides, Macrodn"

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old female with a chief complaint of pulmonary-renal syndrome, respiratory failure in the setting of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient has been diagnosed with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently extubated. Other issues include pulmonary renal syndrome (DAH, acute renal failure, p-ANCA positive glomerulonephritis), leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), metabolic alkalosis, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Monitoring and supportive care will be required to maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome: This condition involves inflammation of both the lungs and kidneys. It can lead to worsening respiratory and renal function, potentially requiring more aggressive interventions such as mechanical ventilation or dialysis.
3. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient has tested positive for HIT, which is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by an immune response to heparin leading to low platelet counts. Alternative anticoagulation strategies will be necessary to prevent thrombotic complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, increasing the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of HIT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 92-year-old female with acute respiratory failure due to pulmonary-renal syndrome (DAH, ARF, p-anca + GN felt [2-17] hydralazine-induced vasculitis). She has been successfully extubated and is now on non-invasive ventilation. The patient's conditions include leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia (Hit +), metabolic alkalosis, and hypertension. She is currently undergoing hemodialysis for clearance and volume removal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure needs close monitoring, and her response to non-invasive ventilation should be assessed. Any signs of worsening respiratory function should be promptly addressed.
2. Pulmonary-Renal Syndrome: The patient's pulmonary-renal syndrome requires ongoing management, including the administration of immunosuppressive therapy (cyclophosphamide and steroids) and close monitoring of renal function.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) increases the risk of bleeding. Monitoring for any signs of bleeding or bruising is essential. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (Hit +) should be managed by holding all heparin products and considering alternative anticoagulant options.
4. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension should be closely monitored, and blood pressure should be managed conservatively to prevent"

   alveolar hemorrhage, thought to be secondary to hydralazine p-ANCA
   induced vasculitis.
   #. Acute respiratory failure: Successfully extubated. The respiratory
   failure most likely due to DAH secondary to pulmonary-renal syndrome
   (positive p anca, vasculitis) suspected to be hydralazine induced p
   anca vasculitis.  Differential also includes Wegener's granulomatosis
   vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA positivity.  Pneumonia
   (including PCP) is possible given prolonged hospital course,
   immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and leukocytosis.  Patient
   successfully extubated this AM.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, thought to be secondary to hydralazine p-ANCA
   induced vasculitis.
   #. Acute respiratory failure: Successfully extubated. The respiratory
   failure most likely due to DAH secondary to pulmonary-renal syndrome
   (positive p anca, vasculitis) suspected to be hydralazine induced p
   anca vasculitis.  Differential also includes Wegener's granulomatosis
   vs. microscopic polyangiitis given pANCA positivity.  Pneumonia
   (including PCP) is possible given prolonged hospital course,
   immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and leukocytosis.  Patient
   successfully extubated this AM.
   - daily ABG
   - continue nebs
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs,
   consider switching to prednisone and PO cytoxan pending swallow study
   - last session plasmapharesis today
   - HD for volume removal
 goal 4 liter negative today
   - while on steroids, continue PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (pentamidine
   given [**2138-9-6**]), close glucose monitoring
   - monitor hematocrit daily for DAH
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   #. Hemoptysis:  likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off
   clotting factors. Given history of gastritis, GI bleed also possible.
   Decreasing amounts of old blood and no new blood from ETT lavages. Hct
   stable.
   - hematocrit stable
   - PPI IV given known gastritis
   - treat DAH as above
   - Goal hct>25
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:   tunneled line in place. Etiology:
   hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis. Patient with renal biopsy on
   [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic vascular disease' and suprisingly
   no evidence of vasculitis, although pANCA level markedly elevated.
   Dialysis for fluid overload per Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   - continue plasmapheresis
 1 more session today
   - continue HD with tunneled line
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Delirium: most likely sundowning. It is unlikely she has delirium
   from any secondary causes or dementia.
   - haldol PRN
   .
   # Possible UTI:  wbcs, bacteria, and few yeast seen on u/a.
   - f/u urine culture.
   - Consider starting diflucan for yeasts.
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis:
   - renal decreasing bicarb conc in diasylate
   - continue to monitor acid-base status
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile.
   - BP elevated (SBP>180), labetolol restarted PRN > 160.
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions for the past few days.
   Several likely contributors, gastritis, DAH.  DIC labs unremarkable. Fe
   studies consistent with anemia of inflammation, not surprising given
   her inflammatory status.
   - transfuse if hematocrit <21 or change in hemodynamics
   - f/u with anemia studies: Fe panel, B12, Folate
   - daily CBC
   .
   # HIT positivity: Given positive HIT, pt has risk of thrombosis,
   especially given her systemic inflammation in the setting of
   vasculitis.
   - although at inc risk for thrombosis, not a candidate for
   anti-coagulation given DAH
   - monitor closely for signs of DVT/PE
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Resolved. Patient did present with uncomplicated UTI
   and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - Hold off on antibiotics for now, low threshold to treat for VAP or
   HAP if she decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with hypertension and glomerulonephritis who was admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) suspected to be secondary to hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is at risk of developing further respiratory failure due to ongoing pulmonary-renal syndrome, potential pneumonia (including PCP), and prolonged hospitalization.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient is likely to continue experiencing hemoptysis due to ongoing DAH and the presence of clotting factors in the blood. Monitoring hematocrit levels is important to assess for ongoing bleeding.
3. Glomerulonephritis: The patient has a history of glomerulonephritis, and the etiology is hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis. Steroid therapy and cytoxan are recommended, and close follow-up with renal specialists is necessary.
4. Delirium: The patient may experience delirium, possibly due to sundowning. Haloperidol can be used as needed.
5. Possible UTI: The patient may have a urinary tract infection, which requires further evaluation and treatment based on urine culture results.
6. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient is at risk of developing metabolic alkalosis, especially if bicarbonate levels continue to decrease"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with acute respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary-renal syndrome (p-ANCA positive vasculitis) and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications including leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, metabolic alkalosis, hypertension, and agitation/delirium.

The patient is currently doing well post-extubation with minimal oxygen requirements. She is receiving nebulizer treatments and continues to be on cyclophosphamide (cytoxan), steroids (to be changed to oral pending swallow evaluation), and plasmapheresis (last run) with input from rheumatology, nephrology, and transfusion services. The patient is also being treated with pentamidine for PCP and hemodialysis (HD) for clearance and volume removal.

The patient's white blood cell count is decreasing, but it is unclear if this is related to cytoxan or not. The healthcare team will monitor the patient closely for any signs of clinical decline or overt change in secretions or imaging, as there is a risk of opportunistic infections due to immunosuppression. The patient has tested positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and all heparin products have been withheld. The patient will be closely monitored for the development of thrombosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of ANCA-associated vasculitis, pulmonary-renal syndrome, and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has been admitted to the ICU due to her condition. 

The patient has been receiving invasive ventilation but is now extubated and doing well on non-invasive oxygen. She was delirious and agitated overnight, so haloperidol was given for sedation. 

The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides, macrodantin, codeine, norvasc, hydralazine, and heparin agents. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/55 mmHg to 201/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's physical examination shows that she is awake and alert, with clear lungs and no edema or rash. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, platelet count of 111 K/uL, creatinine of 2.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 141 mg/dL, sodium of 124 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride of 27 mEq/L, and calcium of 8.5 mg/dL. 

Assessment and Plan:
- Pulmonary-renal syndrome (DAH, ARF, p-anca + GN felt hydralazine-induced vasculitis)
- Leukocytosis
- Anemia
- Thrombocytopenia, HIT +
- Metabolic alkalosis
- Hypertension
- Agitation/delirium at night --> resolved now

The patient is doing well post-extubation with minimal oxygen requirements. She will continue with nebulizers and medications such as cyclophosphamide, steroids (to be changed to oral pending swallow evaluation), and plasmapheresis. The medical team is awaiting a swallow evaluation to determine if she can tolerate oral medications. 

Her white blood cell count continues to decrease, and her hemoglobin level is also low. The patient has a positive HIT antibody and is not a candidate for argatroban. Heparin products have been withheld, and the patient will be monitored for thrombosis. 

The patient's anemia is likely related to the pulmonary-renal syndrome, and she will receive epo with HD (hemodialysis) and be transfused for Hct < 21 or evidence of bleeding. 

The patient's hypertension is being managed with labetalol. 

The patient's agitation/delirium at night has been addressed, and she is now appropriate. Haloperidol or risperid"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - renal planned to remove 4L fluid today during HD, but in the middle
   of HD, blood pressure dipped down to 80s, pt was bradycardic, so was
   given IVF, and was ultimately -2.5L
   - Rheum recs: continue steroids and cytoxan 30mg daily. once able to
   take PO can transition to PO cytoxan. Would add mesna as well once can
   take PO.
   - Renal recs: change cytoxan to PO when tolerating PO
   - S&S recs: nectar thick liquids and pureed solids with the following
   precautions with strict 1:1 supervision, possible NG tube needed
   - PT recs: to rehab
   - pt seemed to be more somnolent today, ABG was ok
   - last pheresis today
   - was going to be called out to the floor but given the incidence
   during HD session, kept her here for now
   - Pt was very agitated overnight and had bad delirium, got 2 doses of
   0.5mg haldol

   CXR from today:
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis,
   now with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in context of diffuse
   alveolar hemorrhage, thought to be secondary to hydralazine p-ANCA
   induced vasculitis.
   #. Acute respiratory failure: Successfully extubated. The respiratory
   failure most likely due to DAH secondary to pulmonary-renal syndrome
   (positive p anca, vasculitis) suspected to be hydralazine induced p
   anca vasculitis, and volume overload in the setting of acute renal
   failure secondary to glomerulonephritis.
   - continue salumedrol 40mg IV Q8 hours and cytoxan per Rheum recs,
   consider switching to prednisone and PO cytoxan once taking PO well
   - continue HD to remove extra fluid, will need HD ultrafiltration
   session today as pt appears to be volume overloaded today
   - continue nebs
   - F/U Rheumatology recs
   - while on steroids, continue PPI IV, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3261**] (pentamidine
   given [**2138-9-6**]), close glucose monitoring
   - monitor hematocrit daily for DAH
   .
   #. Hemoptysis/DAH:  likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing
   off clotting factors. Given history of gastritis, GI bleed also
   possible.  Decreasing amounts of old blood and no new blood from ETT
   lavages. Hct stable.
   - trend hematocrit
   - treat DAH as above
   - Goal hct>21
   .
   #. Glomerulonephritis:  Cr improved today.  tunneled line in place.
   Etiology: hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis. Patient with renal
   biopsy on [**2138-9-1**] which showed 'marked chronic vascular disease' and
   suprisingly no evidence of vasculitis, although pANCA level markedly
   elevated. Dialysis for fluid overload per Renal.
   - Steroid therapy and cytoxan, as above
   - continue HD via tunneled line, will need HD ultrafiltration session
   today as pt appears to be volume loaded.
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #  Thrombocytopenia: Likely secondary to cytoxan treatment. Per
   rheumatology, plt counts nadir after around [**10-29**] d of cytoxan
   treatment, and will rebound after 14 days. It is also possible that it
   is HIT related.
   - contineu to monitor plt count daily
   .
   #. Hypertension:  BP labile, secondary to volume overload.
   - HD ultrafiltration today to remove extra fluid.
   - on labetalol, but pt does not seem to respond to labetalol well
   - metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Delirium: most likely sundowning. It is unlikely she has delirium
   from any secondary causes or dementia.
   - haldol PRN
   .
   # Metabolic alkalosis: improving as bicarb conc in diasylate is
   decreased.
   - repeat ABG today
   - continue to monitor acid-base status
   .
   #. Anemia: Hct stable requiring no transfusions for the past few days.
   DAH plays a role.  DIC labs unremarkable. Fe studies consistent with
   anemia of inflammation, not surprising given her inflammatory status.
   - transfuse if hematocrit <21 or change in hemodynamics
   - daily CBC
   .
   # HIT positivity: Given positive HIT, pt has risk of thrombosis,
   especially given her systemic inflammation in the setting of
   vasculitis.
   - although at inc risk for thrombosis, not a candidate for
   anti-coagulation given DAH
   - monitor closely for signs of DVT/PE
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Resolved. Patient did present with uncomplicated UTI
   and was treated 3-day course of ciprofloxacin.
   - Hold off on antibiotics for now, low threshold to treat for VAP or
   HAP if she decompensates as ARDS may mask infiltrate on CXR

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis and now experiencing acute hypoxic respiratory failure in the context of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), suspected to be secondary to hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Acute respiratory failure due to DAH secondary to pulmonary-renal syndrome (positive p anca vasculitis) and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure.
2. Hemoptysis/DAH: likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off clotting factors. The patient's hematocrit should be trended, and treatment for DAH should continue as before. The goal hematocrit should be maintained above 21.
3. Glomerulonephritis: etiology is hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis. The patient has a tunneled line in place for dialysis for fluid overload per Renal. Steroid therapy and cytoxan should be continued as previously recommended.
4. Thrombocytopenia: likely secondary to cytoxan treatment. The patient's platelet count should be monitored daily.
5. Hypertension: BP is labile, secondary to volume overload. HD ultrafiltration today should be performed to remove extra fluid. The patient should be on labetal"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and glomerulonephritis. She was admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure in the context of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which is believed to be secondary to hydralazine p-ANCA induced vasculitis. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including acute respiratory failure, hemoptysis, glomerulonephritis, delirium, hypertension, metabolic alkalosis, anemia, HIT positivity, and leukocytosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage secondary to pulmonary-renal syndrome. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia, including PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), given her prolonged hospital course and immunosuppression with steroid therapy.

2. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis is likely due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off clotting factors. This can lead to significant blood loss and may require transfusions.

3. Glomerulonephritis: The patient has glomerulonephritis likely induced by hydralazine. This condition can progress to end-stage renal disease if not properly managed.

4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, most likely due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with hypertension, admitted with glomerulonephritis, now experiencing acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) suspected to be secondary to hydralazine p-ANCA induced vasculitis. She is currently in the ICU.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient has successfully been extubated but continues to require nebs and daily ABG monitoring due to the risk of pneumonia (including PCP) and the ongoing possibility of DAH.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient is experiencing hemoptysis likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off clotting factors. There is also a possibility of GI bleed from her history of gastritis.
3. Glomerulonephritis: The etiology is hydralazine-induced pANCA vasculitis. The patient has a renal biopsy showing'marked chronic vascular disease' with no evidence of vasculitis, although her pANCA level is markedly elevated. She requires ongoing steroid therapy, cytoxan, and dialysis for fluid overload.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium most likely due to sundowning. Haldol is being given PRN.
5. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressure that needs to be managed with labetalol and metoprolol when she takes PO.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and glomerulonephritis, currently admitted with acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The DAH is suspected to be secondary to hydralazine-induced p-ANCA vasculitis. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications including pneumonia (including PCP), delirium, hypertension, metabolic alkalosis, anemia, HIT positivity, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is most likely due to DAH secondary to pulmonary-renal syndrome (positive p-ANCA, vasculitis). Pneumonia (including PCP) is also possible given the prolonged hospital course, immunosuppression with steroid therapy, and leukocytosis.

2. Hemoptysis: The patient has experienced hemoptysis, which is likely due to DAH seen on bronchoscopy or dialyzing off clotting factors. GI bleed is also possible due to her history of gastritis.

3. Glomerulonephritis: The patient has glomerulonephritis with renal biopsy showing ""marked chronic vascular disease"" and no evidence of vasculitis, although p-ANCA level is markedly elevated. Dialysis is required for fluid overload per Renal.

4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, most likely sundown"

   - renal planned to remove 4L fluid today during HD, but in the middle
   of HD, blood pressure dipped down to 80s, pt was bradycardic, so was
   given IVF, and was ultimately -2.5L
   - Rheum recs: continue steroids and cytoxan 30mg daily. once able to
   take PO can transition to PO cytoxan. would add mesna as well once can
   take PO.
   - Renal recs: change cytoxan to PO when tolerating PO
   - S&S recs: nectar thick liquids and pureed solids with the following
   precautions with strict 1:1 supervision
   - PT recs: to rehab
   - pt seemed to be more somnolent today, ABG was ok
   - last pheresis today
