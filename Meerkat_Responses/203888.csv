","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, which raised concerns for pneumonia and sepsis. The patient also had symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has been stabilized on pressors with improved oxygenation.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Sepsis/SIRS: The likely source is pneumonia, but urosepsis is also possible. Blood cultures (BCx) and urine cultures (UCx) are pending. The patient will continue receiving norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and central venous pressure (CVP) above 10.

2. Hypotension: This is likely related to sepsis. A [Last Name (un)] stim test is pending. Norepinephrine will be continued as above, and vasopressin may be added for additional blood pressure control if needed. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) should be checked at 3 PM, and a 1L normal saline bolus will be given over 120 minutes.

3. Pneumonia: The differential diagnosis includes typical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), atypical pneumonia including mycoplasma and Legionella, and influenza. Legionella"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, concerning for pneumonia (PNA) and sepsis. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has been stabilized on pressors with improved oxygenation. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis/SIRS: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis due to the likely source being pneumonia, but urosepsis is also possible. Blood cultures are pending.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely related to sepsis and did not respond appropriately to a [Last Name (un)] stim test. Stress dose steroids have been started, and norepinephrine will be continued to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 and central venous pressure (CVP) > 10. Vasopressin may be added for additional blood pressure control as needed.

3. Pneumonia: The differential diagnosis for pneumonia includes typical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), atypical pneumonia including mycoplasma and Legionella, and influenza. Legionella and flu tests have been negative thus far. Osteopathic has been discontinued, and ceftriaxone will be continued for CAP and UTI. Azithromycin will be continued"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and probable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with fever, malaise, and right pleuritic chest pain and was found to have right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA) with a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was in septic shock and was started on antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and UTI.

The patient's current assessment includes acute respiratory failure, improving but still requiring high oxygen levels, pneumonia, and hemoptysis (bloody sputum). The patient is also experiencing septic shock due to pneumonia and is improving, with a decreasing white blood cell count and no fever. The plan is to wean off the pressors (medications that support blood pressure).

The patient has several medical conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and probable COPD. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the aforementioned conditions. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 112/77 mmHg to 118/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on high-flow nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm with a central venous pressure of 12"

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are concerning for pneumonia and sepsis. Urine analysis also suggests a urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 88/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. She is on mechanical ventilation with high-flow nasal cannula. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 0 mmHg, indicating low fluid status. 

Blood tests show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.1 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L, and slightly low platelet count of 112,000/mm^3. Blood cultures are pending. Imaging studies reveal widespread parenchymal opacities in the lungs, which may represent a combination of pulmonary edema and infection, as well as right upper lobe consolidation.

The patient is being treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), along with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for possible adrenal insufficiency. She is also"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with fever, hypotension, and infiltrates on chest X-ray, concerning for pneumonia and sepsis. The patient was stabilized on pressors with improved oxygenation and is now off of pressors and afebrile.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis/SIRS: The patient's likely source of sepsis is pneumonia, but urosepsis is also possible. Cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI).

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to sepsis and did not respond appropriately to [Last Name] stim. The patient has been started on stress dose steroids and is off norepinephrine.

3. Pneumonia: The differential diagnosis for pneumonia includes typical CAP, atypical PNA including mycoplasma and Legionella, and influenza. Legionella and flu tests have been negative thus far. The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone for CAP and UTI, as well as azithromycin for atypical coverage. There is concern for malignancy with the patient's smoking history and chest X-ray findings, so a contrast CT of the chest will be planned when the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with fever, malaise, and right pleuritic chest pain. She was found to have right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA) and a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was initially in septic shock but is now improving. She has acute respiratory failure and some bloody sputum but no frank hemoptysis since yesterday. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI). She is also on levophed for septic shock. Her white blood cell count is improving, and she is afebrile. The plan is to wean off the pressors and continue ICU care. The patient's condition is improving, and she may be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has RLL PNA, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of sepsis, and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. UTI: The patient has a possible UTI, which can lead to urinary symptoms such as fever, dysuria, and increased frequency of urination. There is a risk of complications like pyelonephritis if left untreated.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which can lead"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, and possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with fever, malaise, and right pleuritic chest pain and was found to have right lower lobe pneumonia along with a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). She was initially in septic shock and required the use of levophed. Antibiotics were started for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and UTI.

The patient's current condition shows improvement in acute respiratory failure/pneumonia. It is recommended to recheck sputum culture and continue the current antibiotics. There is also an improvement in hemoptysis. Other issues are being managed by the ICU team.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia. Continued monitoring and management of respiratory function are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Pneumonia complications: Since the patient has pneumonia, complications such as sepsis, abscess formation, or worsening infection can occur. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is essential.
3. UTI complications: Although the UTI seems to be under control, there is a risk of developing complications such as kidney infection or sepsis if not properly managed.
4. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to ensure adequate"
