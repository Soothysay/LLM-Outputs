 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have SBP as well as a
   possibilty of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however now hematocrit is ~21, will plan to transfuse.
   Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger), hyponatremia,
   hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but also
   concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency and cortisol is
   currently pending.
   - Norepinephrine to titrate to MAP>60
   - Antibiotics as below
   - Monitor CVP (goal>8) and SvO2 (goal>70%)
   - F/u cortisol level, consider [**Last Name (un) **] stim test in am;  Cortsol: 29.5
   - BCx consistent with clostridium or bacillus
   - Consult ID regarding appropriate antibiotic regimen
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significantl left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn
   - Add Clindamycin
   - D/C Cipro
   - ID Consult re: abx regimen
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg on day 1 (125g) and 1g/kg (75) on day 3
   .
   Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given hypotension,
   concern for developing respiratory failure given tachypnea. ABG in MICU
   indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator settings.
   - Decrease RR to 24, given most recent ABG.  Maintain FiO2 at 60% for
   now.
   - ABG and lactate [**Hospital1 **]
   - Maintain on ventilator for now given sepsis, plan for EGD.
   - Sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam gtt
   .
   Dyspnea: The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.
   - Follow up rapid influenza
   - f/u sputum culture
   - ABGs as above
   - Continue ventilator support
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and is
   currently 21. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and has
   frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced.
   - GI/liver to do EGD to evaluate for UGIB cause: no bleeding
   - Was transfused 2u pRBC this morning, crossmatch 4u pRBCs.  Transfuse
   as needed for falling Hct.
   - Check hemolysis labs (LDH is elevated at baseline, bili elevated,
   fractionate bili, send hapto) and DIC labs (fibrinogen, d dimer)
   - pantoprazole bolus and gtt, octreotide gtt for likely variceal
   bleeding:
 d/c now as no bleeding
   - Continue IV PPI
   - [**Hospital1 **] hematocrit and lytes11
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a normal anion
   gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect acidosis is
   secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, SBP.  s/p 2
   units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**].
   - Add-on serum EtOH
   - Hepatology will follow patient
   - Hold lactulose, rifaximin for now, restart if post EGD if PO's okay
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient
s acute renal failure likely [**2-9**] sepsis,
   currently improving.
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 77, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.
   - Trend plts
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   - F/u hemolysis labs

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have SBP as well as a
   possibilty of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however now hematocrit is ~21, will plan to transfuse.
   Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger), hyponatremia,
   hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but also
   concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency and cortisol is
   currently pending.
   - Norepinephrine to titrate to MAP>60
   - Antibiotics as below
   - Monitor CVP (goal>8) and SvO2 (goal>70%)
   - F/u cortisol level, consider [**Last Name (un) **] stim test in am;  Cortsol: 29.5
   (elevated)
   - CRP 6.1 (elevated)
   - BCx consistent with corynebacterium vs. propionibacterium
   .
   Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given hypotension,
   concern for developing respiratory failure given tachypnea. ABG in MICU
   indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator settings.
   - Change FiO2 to 60%
   - q4h ABG for now
   - Maintain on ventilator for now given sepsis, plan for EGD.
   - HOB and mouthcare per ICU routine
   - Sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam gtt
   .
   Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis: Abdominal pain, prominent
   neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts) and
   significantl left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting of
   a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneamonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg on day 1 (125g) and 1g/kg (75) on day 3
   .
   Dyspnea: The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.
   - Follow up rapid influenza
   - Send sputum culture
   - ABGs as above
   - Continue ventilator support
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and is
   currently 21. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and has
   frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced.
   - GI/liver to do EGD now to evaluate for UGIB cause: no bleeding
   - Transfuse 2u pRBC now, crossmatch 4u pRBCs
   - Check hemolysis labs (LDH is elevated at baseline, bili elevated,
   fractionate bili, send hapto) and DIC labs (fibrinogen, d dimer)
   - pantoprazole bolus and gtt, octreotide gtt for likely variceal
   bleeding:
 d/c now as no bleeding, start IV PPI
   - q4h hematocrit
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a normal anion
   gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect acidosis is
   secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, SBP.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - transfuse 2u pRBC's now
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**].
   - Add-on serum EtOH
   - Hepatology will follow patient
   - Hold lactulose, rifaximin for now, restart if post EGD if PO's okay
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 77, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.
   - Trend plts
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   - F/u hemolysis labs

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He presented with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain and was found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and possibly community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's current condition includes sepsis without organ dysfunction, anemia (chronic and acute due to blood loss), thrombocytopenia (chronic), cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis other, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, and dyspnea. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 142/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is not provided.

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: FiO2 60%, PEEP 8 cmH2O, Vt set at 500 mL, RR set at 28 breaths per minute, plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O, and compliance of 43.1 mL/cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 19 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 122, and base excess of -10.5 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory results include white blood cell count of 16.7 K/uL, hematocrit of 21.5%, platelet count of 77 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 28 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, sodium of 143 mg/dL, potassium of 6.1 mEq/L, chloride of 100 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 15 mEq/L, blood glucose of 143 mg/dL, and liver enzymes (ALT and AST) elevated. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prothrombin time (PT) of 25.5 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 53.9 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5.

The patient's urinalysis shows 16.7 K/uL of white blood cells, 87% neutrophils, and 33% bands. The patient's ascitic fluid analysis shows 17,000 WBCs per mm³ with 87% neutrophils and a significant left shift on the differential.

The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray (CXR) which initially raised concern for right lower lobe infiltrate, but is now interpreted as normal. The patient's abdominal ultrasound (US) shows no free fluid or organ dysfunction.

The patient's medical history includes hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. The patient has a history of chronic macrocytic anemia secondary to liver disease and has recently experienced an acute blood loss anemia from variceal bleeding or bleeding ulcer.

The patient's immediate concerns include sepsis secondary to SBP and possible CAP, respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, and anemia. The patient requires aggressive management with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and blood transfusions as needed. The patient should be closely monitored for organ dysfunction and complications of his underlying liver disease.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis leading to septic shock, development of organ dysfunction (such as acute kidney injury or hepatic encephalopathy), further gastrointestinal bleeding, and respiratory distress requiring tracheostomy or changes in ventilator settings. The patient's prognosis is guarded due to his underlying liver disease and the severity of his current condition."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with septic shock, respiratory failure, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving multiple antibiotics for the suspected infection. The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension and altered oxygenation. Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, acute kidney injury, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ dysfunction: The patient is at risk of developing organ dysfunction due to septic shock and acute kidney injury.
2. Respiratory complications: Mechanical ventilation may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to further organ perfusion issues.
4. Infection progression: Despite antibiotic therapy, there is a risk of ongoing infection spread and resistance.
5. Liver failure: Acute on chronic liver failure may progress, leading to hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy.
6. Bleeding complications: Thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding events, such as oropharyngeal hemorrhage.
7. Metabolic imbalances: Acidosis and electrolyte abnormalities need careful management to prevent further complications.
8. Renal replacement therapy: The patient may require dialysis due to acute renal failure and hyperkalemia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for peritonitis with Gram-positive rods (GPRs) growing from the peritoneal fluid. The patient's current conditions include septic shock, respiratory failure, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 at 60% and PEEP at 10 cmH2O. Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 82 bpm, hypotension with blood pressure ranging from 65-95/42-49 mmHg, and fever with a maximum temperature of 37.9°C. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels. The patient is also diagnosed with chronic and acute anemia, chronic thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis of the liver, and hepatitis. The patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued septic shock: The patient's pressor requirement and elevated lactate levels suggest ongoing septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however now hematocrit is ~21, will plan to transfuse.
   Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger), hyponatremia,
   hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but also
   concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency and cortisol is
   currently pending.
   - Norepinephrine to titrate to MAP>60; vasopression; (d/c vasopressin
   first as tolerated)
   - d/c cisatracurium
   - Antibiotics as below
   - Monitor CVP (goal>8; ideal [**10-19**]) and SvO2 (goal>70%)
   - repeat AM cortisol stim test today
   - BCx consistent with clostridium perfringens
   - F/u ID consult re: antibiotic regimen, currently on:
   Vanc/Zosyn/Clinda/Micafungin
   - hold CT abdomen given clinical improvement
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significantl left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/Clinda/Micafungin
   - f/u ID Consult re: abx regimen
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg on day 1 (125g) and 1g/kg (75) on day 3
   .
   Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given hypotension,
   concern for developing respiratory failure given tachypnea. ABG in MICU
   indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator settings.
   - Maintain FiO2 at 60% for now, then decrease to 50% as tolerated
   - Decrease RR
   - ABG and lactate [**Hospital1 **] (lactate downtrending now)
   - Maintain on ventilator for now given sepsis, plan for EGD.
   - Sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam gtt
   .
   Dyspnea: The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - ABGs as above
   - Continue ventilator support
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs; ENT to be removed today
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and is
   currently 21. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and has
   frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced.
   - GI/liver to do EGD to evaluate for UGIB cause: no bleeding
   - Was transfused 2u pRBC this morning, crossmatch 4u pRBCs.  Transfuse
   as needed for falling Hct.
   - pantoprazole bolus and gtt, octreotide gtt for likely variceal
   bleeding: d/c
d now as no bleeding
   - Continue IV PPI
   - daily coags and CBC
   - 2 units FFP today and 1 unit cryo before ENT removes packing
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a normal anion
   gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect acidosis is
   secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, SBP.  s/p 2
   units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   - consider lasix in PM to help UO
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**].
   - Add-on serum EtOH - negative
   - Hepatology will follow patient
   - Hold lactulose, rifaximin for now, restart if post EGD if PO's okay
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient
s acute renal failure likely [**2-9**] sepsis,
   monitor. F/u renal recs.
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 77, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, and was found to have peritonitis and a possibility of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. He has sepsis likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and possibly due to pneumonia. He is also experiencing respiratory failure, anemia, chronic thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis of the liver, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to SBP and possibly pneumonia. It is important to continue aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and hemodynamic support.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. Monitoring ABGs, maintaining adequate oxygenation, and weaning off the ventilator as tolerated will be crucial.
3. Anemia: The patient has chronic macrocytic anemia secondary to liver disease and superimposed acute blood loss anemia from variceal bleeding or bleeding ulcer. Blood transfusions may be necessary to maintain adequate hemoglobin levels.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have SBP as well as a
   possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however now hematocrit is ~21, will plan to transfuse.
   Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger), hyponatremia,
   hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but also
   concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency and cortisol is
   currently pending.
   - Norepinephrine to titrate to MAP>60
   - Antibiotics as below
   - Monitor CVP (goal>8) and SvO2 (goal>70%)
   - F/u cortisol level, consider [**Last Name (un) **] stim test in am;  Cortsol: 29.5
   - BCx consistent with clostridium perfringens
   - F/u ID consult re: antibiotic regimen, currently on:
   Vanc/Zosyn/Clinda/Micafungin
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significantl left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin.
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn/Clinda/Micafungin
   - f/u ID Consult re: abx regimen
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg on day 1 (125g) and 1g/kg (75) on day 3
   .
   Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given hypotension,
   concern for developing respiratory failure given tachypnea. ABG in MICU
   indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator settings.
   - Maintain FiO2 at 60% for now.
   - ABG and lactate [**Hospital1 **] (lactate downtrending now)
   - Maintain on ventilator for now given sepsis, plan for EGD.
   - Sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam gtt
   .
   Dyspnea: The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - ABGs as above
   - Continue ventilator support
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and is
   currently 21. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and has
   frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced.
   - GI/liver to do EGD to evaluate for UGIB cause: no bleeding
   - Was transfused 2u pRBC this morning, crossmatch 4u pRBCs.  Transfuse
   as needed for falling Hct.
   - Check hemolysis labs (LDH is elevated at baseline, bili elevated,
   fractionate bili, send hapto) and DIC labs (fibrinogen, d dimer)
   - pantoprazole bolus and gtt, octreotide gtt for likely variceal
   bleeding: d/c
d now as no bleeding
   - Continue IV PPI
   - [**Hospital1 **] hematocrit and lytes11
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a normal anion
   gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect acidosis is
   secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, SBP.  s/p 2
   units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**].
   - Add-on serum EtOH - negative
   - Hepatology will follow patient
   - Hold lactulose, rifaximin for now, restart if post EGD if PO's okay
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient
s acute renal failure likely [**2-9**] sepsis,
   monitor.
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 77, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain and found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient has sepsis, hypothermia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, and concerns for adrenal insufficiency. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a low platelet count and thrombocytopenia. The patient also has anemia, likely secondary to chronic liver disease and acute blood loss. There is evidence of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis and SBP. The patient's MELD score on admission was 27, indicating advanced liver disease. He also has acute renal failure, possibly secondary to sepsis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ dysfunction and failure due to sepsis and multi-organ involvement.
2. Progression of liver disease and potential development of hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Development of respiratory failure and need for prolonged ventilatory support.
4. Further deterioration of renal function and progression to chronic renal failure.
5. Hemorrhagic complications due to thrombocytopenia and potential re-bleeding from var"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis presenting with peritonitis due to Clostridium perfringens. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

1. Septic Shock/GPRs: The patient is still on two pressors (vasopressin and norepinephrine) but his lactate levels have decreased, indicating improvement. Vasopressin will be discontinued.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's FiO2 will be attempted to be weaned.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved.

4. Oropharyngeal hemorrhage: The ENT will be consulted about discontinuing cisatracurium and removal of packing.

Other ongoing issues mentioned in the ICU team's note are also being managed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Organ dysfunction: The patient is at risk for further organ dysfunction, particularly in the context of sepsis and acute renal failure.

2. Infection: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, there is a risk of developing new infections due to the immunocompromised state caused by chronic liver disease and critical illness.

3. Bleeding: Given the patient's coagulopathy and ongoing use of anticoagulants, there is a risk of bleeding complications.

4. Respiratory distress: Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging, and the patient"

   Imaging: KUB [**12-15**]: An overall hazy appearance of the abdomen is
   consistent with ascites.
   The transverse colon is predominantly gas-filled but is distended up to
   6.7 cm
   in diameter. There is no obvious evidence of perforation or free air.
   In the
   setting of C. diff colitis, these findings could represent toxic
   megacolon.
   CXR [**12-15**]:  In comparison with the study of [**12-13**], there is increased
   engorgement of pulmonary vessels with a generalized haziness
   bilaterally,
   consistent with layering pleural effusions. The tip of the endotracheal
   tube
   now lies approximately 3 cm above the carina. Right IJ catheter and
   nasogastric tube remain in place.
   Perihilar prominence, especially in the left suprahilar region, is
   again seen.
   This may merely be reflection of the elevated pulmonary venous
   pressure,
   though the possibility of the supervening pneumonia must be considered.

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Active issues
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission
   was ~21, and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear
   hugger), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with
   sepsis, but also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not
   recently been on steroids and has no other RF for adrenal
   insufficiency.
   - Norepinephrine to titrate to MAP>60; vasopression dc
   - d/c cisatracurium
   - Continuing Zosyn/Clinda/Micafungin per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc
   - Monitor CVP (goal>8; ideal [**10-19**]) and SvO2 (goal>70%)
   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test without appropriate increase in cortisol; however,
   will hold off on steroids for now.
   - BCx consistent with clostridium perfringens
   - hold CT abdomen given clinical improvement
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin.
   - Continue Zosyn/Clinda/Micafungin per ID recs
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg on day 1 (125g) and 1g/kg (75) on day 3 ([**12-17**]).
   - Hepatobiliary sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his
   WBC is still very high, he may need to be explored.
   - General surgery c/s for possible exploration, note pending
   .
   Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given hypotension,
   concern for developing respiratory failure given tachypnea. ABG in MICU
   indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator settings.
   - Maintain FiO2 at 60% for now, then decrease to 50% as tolerated
   - Decrease RR
   - ABG and lactate [**Hospital1 **] (lactate down-trending now)
   - Maintain on ventilator for now given sepsis.
   - Sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam gtt
   .
   Dyspnea: The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - ABGs as above
   - Continue ventilator support
   - Attempt to decrease FiO2 as aobe.
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs; packing removed yesterday. Remainder of packing to be
   removed tomorrow ([**12-18**]).
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.
   - Pt was on pantoprazole bolus and octreotide gtt for likely variceal
   bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT stable.
   - Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - Hepatology will follow patient
   - Hold lactulose, rifaximin for now, restart when PO's okay
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.
   - Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many small
   platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the same
   time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a normal anion
   gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect acidosis is
   secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, SBP.  s/p 2
   units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient
s acute renal failure likely [**2-9**] sepsis,
   monitor. F/u renal recs.
   - Now resolved.

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however now hematocrit is ~21, will plan to transfuse.
   Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger), hyponatremia,
   hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but also
   concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency and cortisol is
   currently pending.
   - Norepinephrine to titrate to MAP>60; vasopression dc
   - d/c cisatracurium
   - Antibiotics as below
   - Monitor CVP (goal>8; ideal [**10-19**]) and SvO2 (goal>70%)
   - repeat AM cortisol stim test today
   - BCx consistent with clostridium perfringens
   - F/u ID consult re: antibiotic regimen, currently on:
   Zosyn/Clinda/Micafungin
   - hold CT abdomen given clinical improvement
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin.
   - Continue Zosyn/Clinda/Micafungin
   -  ID Consult: continue zosyn, clinda, mica, dc vanc
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg on day 1 (125g) and 1g/kg (75) on day 3
   - Hepatobiliary sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his
   WBC is still very high, he may need to be explored.
   .
   Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given hypotension,
   concern for developing respiratory failure given tachypnea. ABG in MICU
   indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator settings.
   - Maintain FiO2 at 60% for now, then decrease to 50% as tolerated
   - Decrease RR
   - ABG and lactate [**Hospital1 **] (lactate downtrending now)
   - Maintain on ventilator for now given sepsis, plan for EGD.
   - Sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam gtt
   .
   Dyspnea: The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - ABGs as above
   - Continue ventilator support
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs; packing removed yesterday. Remainder of packing to be
   removed tomorrow.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and is
   currently 21. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and has
   frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced.
   - GI/liver to do EGD to evaluate for UGIB cause: no bleeding
   - Was transfused 2u pRBC this morning, crossmatch 4u pRBCs.  Transfuse
   as needed for falling Hct.
   - pantoprazole bolus and gtt, octreotide gtt for likely variceal
   bleeding: d/c
d now as no bleeding
   - Continue IV PPI
   - Daily coags and CBC
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a normal anion
   gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect acidosis is
   secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, SBP.  s/p 2
   units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   - consider lasix in PM to help UO
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**].
   - Add-on serum EtOH - negative
   - Hepatology will follow patient
   - Hold lactulose, rifaximin for now, restart if post EGD if PO's okay
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient
s acute renal failure likely [**2-9**] sepsis,
   monitor. F/u renal recs.
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is currently diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a widespread infection. If left untreated or not managed properly, it can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be fatal.

2. Peritonitis: The patient has signs of peritonitis, which is inflammation of the peritoneum, the lining of the abdomen. If not treated promptly, it can progress to a severe infection called spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and lead to organ dysfunction.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), which increases the risk of bleeding complications. This can be a result of sepsis or other underlying conditions.

4. Anemia: The patient has chronic and acute anemia, which may be due to blood loss or other causes. Anemia can compromise oxygen delivery to tissues and may require treatment.

5. Liver cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis of the liver, which is a chronic condition characterized by scarring of the liver tissue. This can lead to complications such as portal hypertension, ascites, and increased risk of infections.

6. Hepatitis: The patient also has hepatitis, which is inflammation of the liver. If not properly managed, it can further damage the liver and lead to complications like hepatic enceph"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for peritonitis due to Clostridium perfringens. The patient's chief complaints include respiratory failure, septic shock, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. Allergies are not known. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Micafungin, Clindamycin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient is being mechanically ventilated with a Vt set at 500 mL, RR set at 16 breaths per minute, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 60%, and SpO2 of 95%. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 33 mmHg, HCO3 of 113 mEq/L, and SaO2 of 95%.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, non-tender and distended abdomen, 1+ edema in both lower extremities, warm skin, and no neurologic assessment due to sedation.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with WBC count ranging from 16.7 to 13.6 K/uL,"

   Active issues
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission
   was ~21, and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear
   hugger), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with
   sepsis, but also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not
   recently been on steroids and has no other RF for adrenal
   insufficiency.

   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test without appropriate increase in cortisol; however,
   will hold off on steroids for now.
   - BCx consistent with clostridium perfringens
   - hold CT abdomen given clinical improvement
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin.
   - Continue Zosyn/Clinda/Micafungin per ID recs
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg on day 1 (125g) and 1g/kg (75) on day 3 ([**12-17**]).
   - Hepatobiliary sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his
   WBC is still very high, he may need to be explored.
   - General surgery c/s for possible exploration, note pending
   .
   Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given hypotension,
   concern for developing respiratory failure given tachypnea. ABG in MICU
   indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator settings.
   - Maintain FiO2 at 60% for now, then decrease to 50% as tolerated
   - Decrease RR
   - ABG and lactate [**Hospital1 **] (lactate down-trending now)
   - Maintain on ventilator for now given sepsis.
   - Sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam gtt
   .
   Dyspnea: The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - ABGs as above
   - Continue ventilator support
   - Attempt to decrease FiO2 as aobe.
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs; packing removed yesterday. Remainder of packing to be
   removed tomorrow ([**12-18**]).
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.
   - Pt was on pantoprazole bolus and octreotide gtt for likely variceal
   bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT stable.
   - Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - Hepatology will follow patient
   - Hold lactulose, rifaximin for now, restart when PO's okay
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.
   - Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many small
   platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the same
   time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a normal anion
   gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect acidosis is
   secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, SBP.  s/p 2
   units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain. The patient has several medical complications that need attention.

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and possibly pneumonia. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and pressors to support blood pressure.

2. Peritonitis: The patient has signs consistent with SBP, including abdominal pain, prominent neutrophilia in ascitic fluid, and a significant left shift on complete blood count (CBC) with differential. He will be treated with ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated in the emergency department due to hypotension and concern for developing respiratory failure. His ABG indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator settings. FiO2 will be maintained at 60% for now, then decreased to 50% as tolerated. RR will be decreased, and ABG and lactate levels will be monitored.

4. Dyspnea: The differential for the patient's dyspnea includes pneumonia, influenza, ascites, or congestive heart failure. A left shift on CBC with diff and recent"

   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally

   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator

   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.

   - f/u ENT recs; packing removed yesterday. Remainder of packing to be
   removed [**12-18**].
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - Hepatology will follow patient
   - Hold lactulose, rifaximin for now, restart when PO's okay
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a normal anion
   gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect acidosis is
   secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, SBP.  s/p 2
   units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, and was found to have peritonitis as well as a possibility of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 98/53 mmHg and a heart rate of 86 bpm. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%. 

The patient has several medical complications, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia, chronic thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, and epistaxis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, decreased platelet count, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased potassium levels. 

The patient's imaging studies reveal a minimally increased right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray and ascites with marked pleat on abdominal ultrasound.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who is currently in the ICU for peritonitis due to Clostridium perfingens. The patient's main complaints are respiratory failure and septic shock.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from his current condition. These include:

1. Septic Shock/GPRs: The patient's lack of improvement in pressor requirement over the last 24 hours indicates ongoing septic shock. This condition can lead to further organ dysfunction and failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is unable to maintain a FIO2 below 0.6, indicating severe respiratory distress. This may progress to complete respiratory failure if not adequately supported.

3. Oropharyngeal hemorrhage: The patient experienced an oropharyngeal bleed, which has been packed. If the bleeding recurs or the packing is unsuccessful, this could result in significant airway compromise.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially given the recent oropharyngeal hemorrhage.

5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's laboratory results show a decreased TCO2 level, indicating metabolic acidosis. This condition can be caused by various factors, including lactic acidosis, renal dysfunction, or poor tissue perfusion.

6. Anemia: The patient"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission
   was ~21, and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear
   hugger), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with
   sepsis, but also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not
   recently been on steroids and has no other RF for adrenal
   insufficiency.  BCx grew Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
   cisatracurium.
   - CT abdomen to r/o perforation, as patient stable to go for scan today
   - Continuing Zosyn/Clinda/Micafungin per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc
   - Norepinephrine to titrate to MAP>60; vasopression dc
   - Monitor CVP (goal [**10-19**]) and SvO2 (goal>70%)
   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test without appropriate increase in cortisol; however,
   will hold off on steroids for now.
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn/Clinda/Micafungin per ID recs
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg on day 1 (125g) and 1g/kg (75) on day 3 ([**12-17**]).
   - General surgery c/s for possible exploration, note pending
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - Consider Lasix diuresis tomorrow or later tonight following CT scan
   for volume overload and pulmonary edema
   - Maintain on ventilator;  Decrease FiO2 from 50% to 40%, increase PEEP
   from 10 to 12 to facilitate this.
   - ABG and lactate [**Hospital1 **] (lactate down-trending now)
   - Sedation with Fentanyl and Midazolam gtt
   - f/u sputum culture
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs; packing removed yesterday. Remainder of packing to be
   removed [**12-18**].
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - Hepatology will follow patient
   - Hold lactulose, rifaximin for now, restart when PO's okay
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a normal anion
   gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect acidosis is
   secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, SBP.  s/p 2
   units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .

   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - Consider Lasix diuresis tomorrow for volume overload, hold for now
   given had IV contrast dye load from CT scan on [**12-17**] so want to protect
   kidneys
   - Maintain on ventilator; Decrease FiO2, keep PEEP steady as given
   abdominal distention feel he needs this PEEP level.
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - Change from fentanyl and midazolam (concern with ARF that these
   medications are going to not be cleared for a while and may potentiate
   AMS as well as ileus); change to propofol
   - f/u sputum culture
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs
   - Give FFP prior to packing removal today ([**12-18**]) by ENT
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - Hepatology will follow patient
   - Hold lactulose, rifaximin for now, restart when PO's okay
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient
s acute renal failure likely [**2-9**] sepsis,
   monitor. F/u renal recs.
   - Now resolved.
   - s/p IV contrast dye load on [**12-17**], watch Cr and hold on diuresis.
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes

","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis presenting with peritonitis caused by C. perfringens. He is currently experiencing septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 108/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 178, and ventilation rate (Ve) of 7.5 L/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, distended abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be non-attentive, not following simple commands, and unresponsive to stimulation, with no assessed movement or tone.

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission
   was ~21, and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear
   hugger), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with
   sepsis, but also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not
   recently been on steroids and has no other RF for adrenal
   insufficiency.  BCx grew Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
   cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on [**12-17**].

   - Monitor CVP (goal [**10-19**]) and SvO2 (goal>70%)
   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test without appropriate increase in cortisol; start
   Hydrocort IV 50mg q6h today ([**12-18**])
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn /Micafungin per ID recs
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u general surgery recs
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - hold for diuresis for now given had IV contrast dye load from CT scan
   on [**12-17**] and has incr Cr over last 2 days
   -  Maintain on ventilator; Decrease FiO2, try to increase PEEP as given
   abdominal distention feel he needs a lot of PEEP.
   - Place esophageal balloon
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off x 24 hours on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility.
   - F/u renal/hepatology recs.
   - will give IV albumin 1g/kg.
   - monitor UOP closely
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Restart lactulose today.  Titrate to 3 BMs daily.
   - Can add back Rifaxamin if no improvement with lactulose alone.
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - Restarting lactulose today
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement, ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, and found to have peritonitis and a possible case of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He is also on multiple pressors to support his blood pressure. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute renal failure, altered mental status, epistaxis, anemia, and hepatitis C cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a progression of pneumonia or if the mechanical ventilation settings need to be adjusted.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can lead to further organ dysfunction and failure if not adequately managed.
3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): SBP can recur, leading to worsening abdominal pain and potentially causing additional complications.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate if not appropriately managed, leading to an accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen, affecting his ability to communicate and interact with healthcare providers.

   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn /Micafungin per ID recs
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u general surgery recs
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - Consider Lasix diuresis tomorrow for volume overload, hold for now
   given had IV contrast dye load from CT scan on [**12-17**] so want to protect
   kidneys
   - Maintain on ventilator; Decrease FiO2, keep PEEP steady as given
   abdominal distention feel he needs this PEEP level.
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - Change from fentanyl and midazolam (concern with ARF that these
   medications are going to not be cleared for a while and may potentiate
   AMS as well as ileus); change to propofol
   - f/u sputum culture

   monitor. F/u renal recs.
   - Now resolved.
   - s/p IV contrast dye load on [**12-17**], Cr now rising.
   - consider small fluid bolus
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - Hepatology will follow patient
   - Hold lactulose, rifaximin for now, restart when PO's okay
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement, ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea, diffuse abdominal pain, and found to have peritonitis and possible CAP. The patient is currently in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation. He has sepsis secondary to SBP, pneumonia, acute renal failure, anemia (chronic and acute), thrombocytopenia (chronic), cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and treatment for various complications associated with his underlying conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypotension and concern for developing respiratory failure. There is a need to maintain oxygenation and prevent further respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis secondary to SBP and possibly due to pneumonia. Continuous monitoring and aggressive management of infection with appropriate antibiotics are necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely secondary to sepsis. Close monitoring of renal function and management of fluid and electrolyte balance are required.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic macrocytic anemia secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia. Transfusion as needed for falling hematoc"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission
   was ~21, and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear
   hugger), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with
   sepsis, but also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not
   recently been on steroids and has no other RF for adrenal
   insufficiency.  BCx grew Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
   cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on [**12-17**].
   - Continuing Zosyn & Micafungin per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc and clindamycin
   - Norepinephrine to titrate to MAP>60; vasopression dc
 pressors
   off
   - Monitor CVP (goal [**10-19**]) and SvO2 (goal>70%)
   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test without appropriate increase in cortisol; start
   Hydrocort IV 50mg q6h today ([**12-18**])
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn /Micafungin per ID recs
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u general surgery recs
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - hold for diuresis for now given had IV contrast dye load from CT scan
   on [**12-17**] and has incr Cr over last 2 days
   -  Maintain on ventilator; Decrease FiO2, try to increase PEEP as given
   abdominal distention feel he needs a lot of PEEP.
   - Place esophageal balloon
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off x 24 hours on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility.
   - F/u renal/hepatology recs.
   - will give IV albumin 1g/kg.
   - monitor UOP closely
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Restart lactulose today.  Titrate to 3 BMs daily.
   - Can add back Rifaxamin if no improvement with lactulose alone.
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - Restarting lactulose today
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain and was found to have peritonitis and a possibility of CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia). The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute renal failure (ARF), altered mental status, epistaxis, anemia, hepatitis C cirrhosis, and thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's respiratory status is critical, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of fluid overload and CHF (Congestive Heart Failure) on chest X-ray. The patient also has evidence of volume overload, as suggested by elevated central venous pressure (CVP) and edema. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, with rising creatinine levels over the past few days. This could be due to aggressive diuresis and IV contrast load for a CT abdomen. However, hepatorenal syndrome is also a possibility.

The patient has altered mental status, which may be attributed to stage 4 hepatic encephalopathy, given the patient's severe liver disease and rising bilirubin levels. 

Additionally, the patient has anemia, likely secondary to chronic macrocytic anemia due to liver disease, with acute"

   hugger), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with
   sepsis, but also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not
   recently been on steroids and has no other RF for adrenal
   insufficiency.  BCx grew Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
   cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on [**12-17**].
   - Continuing Zosyn per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Attempt to wean Norepinephrine to titrate to MAP>60; vasopression

   - Start Midodrine per ID recs to help wean off pressors
   - Continue Octreotide
   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test without appropriate increase in cortisol; started
   Hydrocort IV 50mg q6h today ([**12-18**]).  Wean [**12-20**] to Hydrocort IV 25mg
   q6h.
   - Monitor CVP (goal [**10-19**])
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn as above
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - Consider repeat paracentesis to trend WBC count and abdominal
   pressure preventing lung expansion
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   -  Maintain on ventilator; Decrease FiO2 from 50% to 40% today.
   Increased PEEP [**12-19**] given abdominal distention causing likely lung
   compression.
   - Esophageal balloon in place
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   - hold for diuresis for now given had IV contrast dye load from CT scan
   on [**12-17**] and has incr Cr over last 2 days
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - IVF 1L D5W today for free water
   - IV albumin 50g if UOP decreases
   - monitor UOP closely
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Re-start Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, and found to have peritonitis as well as a possibility of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient is currently intubated due to hypotension and concern for developing respiratory failure.

The patient's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was 21 on admission. He is guaiac positive on exam in the ED, and had frank blood in NGT. There is suspicion of acute blood loss anemia from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No bleeding source was found during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). 

The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, possibly due to aggressive diuresis in the last several days and IV contrast load for a CT abdomen. However, hepatorenal syndrome is also a possibility, given the administration of Midodrine, Octreotide, and Albumin.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to stage 4 hepatic encephalopathy, given his severe liver disease and rising bilirubin levels. 

The patient has a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis with a MELD score of 27 on admission. His liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and he is jaundiced.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to poor synthetic function in the setting of liver disease. He has chronic epistaxis, and there are no schistocytes on smear to indicate hemolysis.

The patient's non-anion gap metabolic acidosis has resolved, but he still has lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, SBP. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfusion.

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 559 mL over the past 24 hours, indicating fluid overload. He also has evidence of volume overload and congestive heart failure (CHF) given edema, CXR consistent with fluid overload, and elevated central venous pressure (CVP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given the patient's liver disease and recent administration of Midodrine and Octreotide, hepatorenal syndrome should be considered as a possible cause of the acute renal failure.

2. Chronic liver disease complications: The patient's history of hepatitis C cirrhosis puts him at risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices bleeding, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

3. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status suggests sepsis, likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or pneumonia.

4. Respiratory failure: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of C. perfringens peritonitis, septic shock, and respiratory failure. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. They have been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Clindamycin, Micafungin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is mechanically ventilated and has an endotracheal tube in place. They are receiving norepinephrine and octreotide infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have a distended abdomen and bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is complicated by respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, chronic anemia, acute blood loss anemia, chronic thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, metabolic acidosis, and other comorbidities. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU with appropriate prophylactic measures in place."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with peritonitis caused by Clostridium perfringens. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, chronic anemia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, chronic thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/55 mmHg to 156/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 196.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.1 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 38 K/uL, blood glucose level of 86 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.2 mg/dL, total bilirubin (TBili) level of 31 mg/dL, lactate level of 2.2 mmol/L, D-dimer level of 4697 ng/mL, and elevated liver enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST).

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal cardiovascular findings, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin. Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive and does not follow simple commands.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications. Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, acute kidney injury, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and coagulopathy."

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission
   was ~21, and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear
   hugger), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with
   sepsis, but also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not
   recently been on steroids and has no other RF for adrenal
   insufficiency.  BCx grew Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
   cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on [**12-17**].
   - Continuing Zosyn per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue Octreotide gtt
   - Continue Midodrine per ID recs to help wean off pressors
   - Attempt to wean Norepinephrine to titrate to MAP>60; vasopression
   dc
   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test without appropriate increase in cortisol; started
   Hydrocort IV 50mg q6h today ([**12-18**]).  Wean [**12-20**] to Hydrocort IV 25mg
   q6h.
   - Monitor CVP (goal [**10-19**])
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn as above
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - Consider repeat paracentesis to trend WBC count and abdominal
   pressure preventing lung expansion
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   -  Maintain on ventilator; Decrease FiO2 from 50% to 40% today.
   Increased PEEP [**12-19**] given abdominal distention causing likely lung
   compression.
   - Esophageal balloon in place
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   - hold for diuresis for now given had IV contrast dye load from CT scan
   on [**12-17**] and has incr Cr over last 2 days
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - IVF 1L D5W today for free water
   - IV albumin 50g if UOP decreases
   - monitor UOP closely
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Re-start Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - f/u ENT recs
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea, diffuse abdominal pain, and found to have peritonitis as well as a possibility of CAP. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, respiratory failure (acute), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia (chronic and acute), thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, metabolic acidosis, and epistaxis. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, pressors, and other medications. The patient remains in the ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure, elevated heart rate, and fever suggest sepsis. It is important to continue treating with appropriate antibiotics and provide supportive care.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's difficulty in breathing and low oxygen saturation indicate respiratory failure. Maintaining him on mechanical ventilation and adjusting the ventilator settings as needed is crucial.
3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The presence of abdominal pain, neutrophilia in ascitic fluid, and significant left-shift on CBC with diff are consistent with SBP. Continued treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient has both chronic and acute anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission
   was ~21, and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear
   hugger), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with
   sepsis, but also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not
   recently been on steroids and has no other RF for adrenal
   insufficiency.  BCx grew Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
   cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on [**12-17**].
   - Continuing Zosyn per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue Octreotide gtt
   - Continue Midodrine per ID recs to help wean off pressors
   - Pressors off as of [**12-20**]
   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test without appropriate increase in cortisol; started
   Hydrocort IV 50mg q6h today ([**12-18**]).  Weaned [**12-20**] to Hydrocort IV 25mg
   q6h.  D/C
ed Hydrocort [**12-21**].
   - Monitor CVP (goal [**10-19**])
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; consider
   Metoclopramide/Reglan if patient begins having bowel sounds to increase
   gastric motility and improve abdominal distension
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - Consider repeat paracentesis to trend WBC count and abdominal
   pressure preventing lung expansion
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   -  Maintain on ventilator; Decrease FiO2 from 50% to 40% today.
   Increased PEEP [**12-19**] given abdominal distention causing likely lung
   compression.  Attempt to decrease PEEP from 15 to 12 given patient
   tolerated weaning of FIO2.
   - Esophageal balloon in place
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   - hold for diuresis for now given had IV contrast dye load from CT scan
   on [**12-17**] and has incr Cr over last 2 days
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved
   UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - Given pt has nl sodium, hold on IVF today
   - IV albumin 50g if UOP decreases
   - monitor UOP closely
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes.
   Initiate TPN today and consult nutrition.

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission
   was ~21, and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear
   hugger), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with
   sepsis, but also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not
   recently been on steroids and has no other RF for adrenal
   insufficiency.  BCx grew Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
   cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on [**12-17**].
   - Continuing Zosyn per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue Octreotide gtt
   - Continue Midodrine per ID recs to help wean off pressors
   - Pressors off as of [**12-20**]
   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test without appropriate increase in cortisol; started
   Hydrocort IV 50mg q6h today ([**12-18**]).  Weaned [**12-20**] to Hydrocort IV 25mg
   q6h.  D/C
ed Hydrocort [**12-21**].
   - Monitor CVP (goal [**10-19**])
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; consider
   Metoclopramide/Reglan if patient begins having bowel sounds to increase
   gastric motility and improve abdominal distension
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - Consider repeat paracentesis to trend WBC count and abdominal
   pressure preventing lung expansion
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   -  Maintain on ventilator; Decrease FiO2 from 50% to 40% today.
   Increased PEEP [**12-19**] given abdominal distention causing likely lung
   compression.  Attempt to decrease PEEP from 15 to 12 given patient
   tolerated weaning of FIO2.
   - Esophageal balloon in place
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   - hold for diuresis for now given had IV contrast dye load from CT scan
   on [**12-17**] and has incr Cr over last 2 days
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved
   UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - Given pt has nl sodium, hold on IVF today
   - IV albumin 50g if UOP decreases
   - monitor UOP closely
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes.
   Initiate TPN today and consult nutrition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, and found to have peritonitis and a possibility of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient's condition has progressed to respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute anemia secondary to blood loss, chronic thrombocytopenia, and hepatic encephalopathy. Other less active issues include epistaxis, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains intubated and on ventilator support. He is also receiving various medications and treatments for his multiple conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function leading to complete respiratory failure if the underlying cause (e.g., SBP, pneumonia) is not effectively treated.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, and there is a risk of progression to septic shock if the infection is not controlled promptly.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen if the"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21, and pt was
   transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].
   - Continuing Zosyn per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue Octreotide gtt
   - Continue Midodrine per hepatology recs
   - Pressors off as of [**12-20**]
   - Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**]
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now, but could consider if patient begins
   having increased bowel sounds to help increase gastric motility and
   improve abdominal distension
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - holding on repeat paracentesis as will not alter clinical management
   at this time
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   -  Maintain on ventilator; transitioning pt to PSV today ([**12-22**]). Will
   titrate as tolerated.
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved
   UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - daily IV albumin 50g IV daily
   - monitor UOP closely
   - check urine lytes
   - decreased dose of Octreotide by
 for HRS dosing
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes.
   Initiate TPN today and consult nutrition.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement, ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, and found to have peritonitis as well as a possibility of CAP. He has respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. He also has spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), chronic anemia, thrombocytopenia, altered mental status, and hepatitis C cirrhosis. The patient's condition remains critical, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for pneumonia or influenza, as well as fluid overload and congestive heart failure (CHF) due to elevated CVP and edema.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been rising again, indicating acute renal failure. This may be due to aggressive diuresis and IV contrast load for CT abdomen. Hepatorenal syndrome is also a possibility.

3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which is likely secondary to SBP and possibly pneumonia. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

4. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has signs consistent with SBP, including abdominal pain, high neutroph"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21, and pt was
   transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].
   - Continuing Zosyn per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue Octreotide gtt
   - Continue Midodrine per ID recs to help wean off pressors
   - Pressors off as of [**12-20**]
   - [**Last Name (un) 1398**] stim test without appropriate increase in cortisol; started
   Hydrocort IV 50mg q6h today ([**12-18**]).  Weaned [**12-20**] to Hydrocort IV 25mg
   q6h.  D/C
ed Hydrocort [**12-21**].
   - Monitor CVP (goal [**10-19**])
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; consider
   Metoclopramide/Reglan if patient begins having bowel sounds to increase
   gastric motility and improve abdominal distension
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - Consider repeat paracentesis to trend WBC count and abdominal
   pressure preventing lung expansion
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   -  Maintain on ventilator; Decrease FiO2 from 50% to 40% today.
   Increased PEEP [**12-19**] given abdominal distention causing likely lung
   compression.  Attempt to decrease PEEP from 15 to 12 given patient
   tolerated weaning of FIO2.
   - Esophageal balloon in place
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   - hold for diuresis for now given had IV contrast dye load from CT scan
   on [**12-17**] and has incr Cr over last 2 days
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved
   UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - Given pt has nl sodium, hold on IVF today
   - IV albumin 50g if UOP decreases
   - monitor UOP closely
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes.
   Initiate TPN today and consult nutrition.

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21, and pt was
   transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   - Continuing Zosyn per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue Octreotide gtt
   - Continue Midodrine per hepatology recs
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now, but could consider if patient begins
   having increased bowel sounds to help increase gastric motility and
   improve abdominal distension
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - holding on repeat paracentesis as will not alter clinical management
   at this time
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - Maintain on ventilator; transitioning pt to PSV today ([**12-22**]). Will
   titrate as tolerated.
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved
   UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - daily IV albumin 50g IV daily
   - monitor UOP closely
   - check urine lytes
   - decreased dose of Octreotide by
 for HRS dosing
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes.
   Initiate TPN today and consult nutrition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain and was found to have peritonitis and a possible case of pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 135/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and on PSV ventilation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. The patient has metabolic acidosis and altered mental status. Imaging reveals increased diffuse left lung opacity and increased blunting of the left costophrenic angle, consistent with fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dyspnea and hypotension suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, but there may be a need for further respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count indicate potential sepsis. He has been diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and may have concurrent pneumonia.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21, and pt was
   transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   - Continuing Zosyn per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue Octreotide gtt
   - Continue Midodrine per hepatology recs
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Continue Zosyn as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now, but could consider if patient begins
   having increased bowel sounds to help increase gastric motility and
   improve abdominal distension
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - holding on repeat paracentesis as will not alter clinical management
   at this time
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - Maintain on ventilator; transitioning pt to PSV today ([**12-22**]). Will
   titrate as tolerated.
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved
   UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - daily IV albumin 50g IV daily
   - monitor UOP closely
   - check urine lytes
   - decreased dose of Octreotide by
 for HRS dosing
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes.
   Initiate TPN today and consult nutrition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain and was found to have peritonitis and possibly CAP. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), chronic anemia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, metabolic acidosis, and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, as indicated by the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for pneumonia or influenza, and the presence of fluid overload and congestive heart failure (CHF) may contribute to his respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of systemic infection, which can lead to sepsis. His elevated white blood cell count, fever, and tachycardia are indicative of an infection.
3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has symptoms consistent with SBP, including abdominal pain, elevated neutrophil count in ascitic fluid, and significant left shift on CBC with diff. SBP is a life-threatening complication of cirrhosis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21, and pt was
   transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   - Switched Zosyn to Cipro/Clinda 12/15 per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc,
   Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue Octreotide gtt and Midodrine per hepatology recs
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Cipro/Clinda as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now, but could consider if patient begins
   having increased bowel sounds to help increase gastric motility and
   improve abdominal distension
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - holding on repeat paracentesis as will not alter clinical management
   at this time
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - Maintain on ventilator; transitioning pt to PSV today ([**12-22**]).
   Attempt to decrease PEEP from 15 -> 12
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Leukocytosis:  Most likely etiology is C. diff given antibiotics and
   leukocytosis with low grade fever.  No clear evidence of infection.
   - f/u C. diff
   - Consider pan culture if develops fever or leukocytosis worsens
   .
   Hypernatremia:  Likely insensitivity to Aldosterone vs. hepatorenal
   syndrome, given patient has received free water yesterday without
   sodium response.
   - D5W 2L today
   - Consider free water flushes if hypernatremia fails to improve, but
   hold for now
   - Lasix 40mg IV x1
   - Spironolactone 100mg daily to diurese sodium off
   - Goal I/O -1.5-2L today
   .
   Gynecomastia:  Gynecomastia [**2-9**] liver failure and increased estrogen,
   but marked tenderness of areolar region b/l is concerning.
   - Consult liver regarding tenderness, and whether this occurs with
   gynecomastia
   - Prolactin level
   - Discuss with GF whether pt had tenderness at baseline, as pt has been
   non-responsive until recently
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved
   UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - daily IV albumin 50g IV daily
   - monitor UOP closely
   - check urine lytes
   - decreased dose of Octreotide by
 for HRS dosing
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes.
   Initiate TPN today and consult nutrition.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He presented with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain and was found to have peritonitis, possibility of CAP, and sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a recent transition to pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute on chronic liver failure, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), thrombocytopenia, anemia, altered mental status, and hepatitis C cirrhosis. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including volume overload, fluid imbalance, electrolyte disturbances, renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia, influenza, ascites, or congestive heart failure (CHF). Maintaining the patient on mechanical ventilation and gradually decreasing PEEP may help improve oxygenation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, indicated by rising creatinine levels. Hepatorenal syndrome and aggressive diuresis are possible causes. Daily monitoring of urine output, electrolyte balance, and consideration of renal replacement therapy may be necessary.
3. SBP: The patient's neutrophilic"

   - Continue Octreotide gtt and Midodrine per hepatology recs
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still

   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - Maintain on ventilator; transitioning pt to PSV today ([**12-22**]). Will
   titrate as tolerated.
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved
   UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - daily IV albumin 50g IV daily
   - monitor UOP closely
   - check urine lytes
   - decreased dose of Octreotide by
 for HRS dosing
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes.
   Initiate TPN today and consult nutrition.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, and found to have peritonitis and possible CAP. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory failure, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute renal failure, altered mental status, anemia, hepatitis C cirrhosis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, tachycardia, increased diffuse left lung opacity on chest X-ray, and elevated CVP. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 135/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's increased diffuse left lung opacity on chest X-ray, along with elevated CVP and hypotension, suggests the possibility of fluid overload and pulmonary edema, which can lead to ARDS.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's severe liver disease and rising bilirubin levels indicate a potential risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: Given the patient's worsening renal function and"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21, and pt was
   transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   - Switched Zosyn to Cipro/Clinda 12/15 per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc,
   Clindamycin, Micafungin; = continue cipro/clinda
   - Continue Octreotide gtt and Midodrine per hepatology recs
   - rising WBC: blood culture if spikes (even low spike); sputum culture
   now; c.diff send repeat
   - diagnostic para today
   - monitor fever curve, low-grade temps, tachycardia, as concern for
   infection
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Cipro/Clinda as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - diagnostic paracentesis today
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - Continue on PSV with current PEEP of 10 today, as tolerated
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - cultures today
   - diurese today with lasix 80mg, goal 1-1.5L negative
   - 5pm lytes
   - 100mg daily spironolactone continue
   .
   Leukocytosis:  Most likely etiology is C. diff given antibiotics and
   leukocytosis with low grade fever.  No clear evidence of infection.
   - pan-culture, repeat c.diff
   .
   Hypernatremia:  Likely insensitivity to Aldosterone vs. hepatorenal
   syndrome.
   - Give another 1 L of D5W at 150cc/hour
    - pm lyte check
   - Cont. free water flushes
   - diuresis as above with lasix and spironolactone
   .
   Gynecomastia:  Gynecomastia [**2-9**] liver failure and increased estrogen,
   but marked tenderness of areolar region b/l is concerning. Prolactin
   elevated.
   - cont tamoxifen
   - discuss with GF whether pt had tenderness at baseline, as pt has been
   non-responsive until recently
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Resolved. Redose meds.
   Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be due to sepsis which
   resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x 2 days (during this
   hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5 [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely
   due to aggressive diuresis in last several days plus IV contrast load
   for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome is also a possibility, given
   Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - d/c albumin
   - monitor UOP closely
   - continue octreotide
   - diuresis as above
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin. Improved.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   - culture of infection
   - telemetry
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea, diffuse abdominal pain, and found to have peritonitis and a possible CAP. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), hypernatremia, gynecomastia, altered mental status, anemia, hepatitis C cirrhosis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been treated with various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, diuretics, vasopressors, and blood transfusions. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 117/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggests sepsis. The source of infection could be spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or pneumonia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's dyspnea and low oxygen saturation indicate respiratory failure. The underlying cause could be pneumonia, aspiration, or fluid overload due to cirrhosis.

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21, and pt was
   transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   - Switched Zosyn to Cipro/Clinda 12/15 per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc,
   Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue Octreotide gtt and Midodrine per hepatology recs
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Cipro/Clinda as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now, but could consider if patient begins
   having increased bowel sounds to help increase gastric motility and
   improve abdominal distension
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - holding on repeat paracentesis as will not alter clinical management
   at this time
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - Maintain on ventilator; transitioning pt to PSV today ([**12-22**]).
   Attempt to decrease PEEP from 15 -> 12
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - f/u sputum culture
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Leukocytosis:  Most likely etiology is C. diff given antibiotics and
   leukocytosis with low grade fever.  No clear evidence of infection.
   - f/u C. diff
   - Consider pan culture if develops fever or leukocytosis worsens
   .
   Hypernatremia:  Likely insensitivity to Aldosterone vs. hepatorenal
   syndrome, given patient has received free water yesterday without
   sodium response.
   - D5W 2L today
   - Cont. free water flushes
   - Lasix 40mg IV x1
   - Spironolactone 100mg daily to diurese sodium off
   - Goal I/O -1.5-2L today
   .
   Gynecomastia:  Gynecomastia [**2-9**] liver failure and increased estrogen,
   but marked tenderness of areolar region b/l is concerning. Prolactin
   elevated.
   - cont tamoxifen
   - discuss with GF whether pt had tenderness at baseline, as pt has been
   non-responsive until recently
   - consider endocrine consult
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved
   UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - daily IV albumin 50g IV daily
   - monitor UOP closely
   - check urine lytes
   - decreased dose of Octreotide by
 for HRS dosing
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 1-1.5L out
   - PM lytes
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Hold on IVF today given peripheral edema, replete electrolytes.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, presenting with peritonitis caused by C. perfringens. The patient's current conditions include septic shock, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, acute pain, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), chronic anemia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), chronic thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/63 mmHg to 139/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is not mentioned.

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The respiratory support indicates the need for careful monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation parameters.

The patient has a history of chronic liver disease, as evidenced by cirrhosis and previous episodes of SBP. These conditions increase the risk of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also possibly due to
   pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors and IVF bolus to
   support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so pRBCs were not
   administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21, and pt was
   transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   - Switched Zosyn to Cipro/Clinda 12/15 per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc,
   Clindamycin, Micafungin; = continue cipro/clinda
   - Continue Octreotide gtt and Midodrine per hepatology recs
   - rising WBC: blood culture if spikes (even low spike); sputum culture
   now; c.diff send repeat
   - diagnostic para today
   - monitor fever curve, low-grade temps, tachycardia, as concern for
   infection
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Cipro/Clinda as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - diagnostic paracentesis today
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - Continue on PSV with current PEEP of 10 today, as tolerated
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off on [**12-19**]
   - cultures today
   - diurese today with lasix 80mg, goal 1-1.5L negative
   - 5pm lytes
   - 100mg daily spironolactone continue
   .
   Leukocytosis:  Most likely etiology is C. diff given antibiotics and
   leukocytosis with low grade fever.  No clear evidence of infection.
   - pan-culture, repeat c.diff
   .
   Hypernatremia:  Likely insensitivity to Aldosterone vs. hepatorenal
   syndrome.
   - Give another 1 L of D5W at 150cc/hour
    - pm lyte check
   - Cont. free water flushes
   - diuresis as above with lasix and spironolactone
   .
   Gynecomastia:  Gynecomastia [**2-9**] liver failure and increased estrogen,
   but marked tenderness of areolar region b/l is concerning. Prolactin
   elevated.
   - cont tamoxifen
   - discuss with GF whether pt had tenderness at baseline, as pt has been
   non-responsive until recently
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Resolved. Redose meds.
   Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be due to sepsis which
   resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x 2 days (during this
   hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5 [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely
   due to aggressive diuresis in last several days plus IV contrast load
   for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome is also a possibility, given
   Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - d/c albumin
   - monitor UOP closely
   - continue octreotide
   - diuresis as above
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin. Improved.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, and additional AMS w/u if no improvement with
   tx of hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures (paracentesis)
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   - culture of infection
   - telemetry
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient's medical complications and conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and possibly pneumonia. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation.

2. SBP: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest SBP, which is an infection of the ascitic fluid. It is a medical emergency and requires prompt treatment with antibiotics.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms consistent with pneumonia, including fever, elevated white blood cell count, and a possible infiltrate on chest X-ray. Appropriate antibiotics are being administered.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated during hospitalization, likely due to aggressive diuresis and IV contrast exposure. Hepatorenal syndrome is also a consideration.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits decreased mental status, which could be attributed to stage 4 hepatic encephalopathy, especially given the patient's severe liver disease and rising bilirubin levels.

6. Anemia: The patient has a chronic macrocytic anemia secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia from variceal bleeding or bleeding ulcer.

7. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, evidenced by a MELD score of 27 and elevated bilirubin levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis/leukocytosis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also
   possibly due to pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors
   and IVF bolus to support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so
   pRBCs were not administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21,
   and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   - Switched Zosyn to Cipro/Clinda 12/15 per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc,
   Clindamycin, Micafungin; = continue cipro/clinda for now
   - Peritoneal infection appears adequately treated, given recent para
   with WBC 86 (<250).
   - Leukocytosis: Unclear source at present
sputum, blood, urine cultures
   are pending. C. diff has been negative x 2.  As pt has been clinically
   improving over same period, will continue to monitor and keep only
   Cipro/Clinda for now.
   - Broaden abx if pt spikes a fever or decompensate (add back
   Vanc/Zosyn).
   - Discontinuing Octreotide gtt per hepatology recs
   - Continuing Midodrine
   - monitor fever curve, low-grade temps, tachycardia
   - will try to discontinue lines, as patient improves clinically.
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Cipro/Clinda as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - results of recent paracentesis do not suggest on-going intraabdominal
   infection.
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP.
   - Continue on PSV with current PEEP of 10 today, as tolerated
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - All sedation off since [**12-19**]
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 0.5-1L negative today
   - 5pm lytes
   - continue 100mg daily spironolactone
   - will check an SBT with ABG before and after
   .
   Hypernatremia:  Likely insensitivity to Aldosterone vs. hepatorenal
   syndrome. Currently resolved.
   - Will continue free water flushes at 300cc q6h.
    - pm electrolyte check
   -  diuresis as above with lasix and spironolactone.
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin. Improved.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, additional AMS w/u if no improvement with tx of
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures
   - Checking direct bilirubin today ([**12-25**]), as pt w. decr HCT and
   increased total bili, to rule out hemolysis.
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   - culture of infection
   - telemetry
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   . Gynecomastia:  Gynecomastia [**2-9**] liver failure and increased estrogen.
   Prolactin elevated. Pt has a history of painful gynecomastia, per pt
   girlfriend.
   - cont tamoxifen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Resolved. Redose meds.
   Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be due to sepsis which
   resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x 2 days (during this
   hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5 [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely
   due to aggressive diuresis in last several days plus IV contrast load
   for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome is also a possibility, given
   Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - d/c albumin
   - monitor UOP closely
   - d/c octreotide
   - diuresis as above
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, and was found to have peritonitis as well as a possibility of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis/leukocytosis: Suspect sepsis is due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) as well as possibly pneumonia. Will treat with antibiotics as outlined below, pressors, and IV fluid bolus to support blood pressure.
2. Peritonitis:?SBP but without positive cultures. Abdominal pain, prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts), and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for pneumonia will treat with ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary surgery recommendations ([12-15]): recommend re-tapping him today. If his WBC is still very high, he may need to be explored. WBC high but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for peritonitis caused by C. perfringens. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory failure, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), anemia (both chronic and acute due to blood loss), thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, metabolic acidosis, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued progression of septic shock: The patient's condition may worsen if the septic shock is not effectively managed with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, as there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
3. Complications related to cirrhosis: The patient's underlying liver disease increases the risk of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and interventions should be taken to prevent further deterioration.
5. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system, there is an increased risk of infections, including hospital-acquired infections.
6. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of blood loss increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Hepatitis: The patient's hepatitis may progress and lead to"

   - Given rising total bili, we looked at pt's smear, which showed
   spherocytes, target cells, burr cells, no schistocytes. Sent Coombs
   test and direct bili (19.1), to eval for hemolysis. also obtained Abd
   US to eval for patency of portal vasculature: showed patent portal
   vasculature, no intrahepatic duct dilitation, CBD borderline at 7mm,
   likely calculus in GB, GB distension, but without wall changes
   suggestive of cholecystitis.
   - coombs test came back positive -- ? drug-induced hemolytic anemia (as
   t. bili started to rise after zosyn change to cipro/flagyl on night of

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis/leukocytosis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also
   possibly due to pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors
   and IVF bolus to support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so
   pRBCs were not administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21,
   and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   Octreotide discontinued per hepatology.  Switched Zosyn to Cipro/Clinda
   12/15 per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue cipro/clinda for now
   - Peritoneal infection appears adequately treated, given recent para
   with WBC 86 (<250).
   - Leukocytosis: Unclear source at present
sputum, blood, urine cultures
   are pending. C. diff has been negative x 2.  As pt has been clinically
   improving over same period, will continue to monitor and keep only
   Cipro/Clinda for now.
   - Broaden abx if pt spikes a fever or decompensate (add back
   Vanc/Zosyn).
   - Continuing Midodrine
   - monitor fever curve, low-grade temps, tachycardia
   - will try to discontinue lines, as patient improves clinically.
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Cipro/Clinda as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - results of recent paracentesis do not suggest on-going intraabdominal
   infection.
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP. All sedation off
   since [**12-19**].
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal 0.5-1L negative today
   - 5pm lytes
   - continue 100mg daily spironolactone
   - will check an SBT with ABG before and after
   .
   Hypernatremia:  Likely insensitivity to Aldosterone vs. hepatorenal
   syndrome. Currently resolved.
   - Will continue free water flushes at 300cc q6h.
    - pm electrolyte check
   -  diuresis as above with lasix and spironolactone.
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin. Improved.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, additional AMS w/u if no improvement with tx of
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures
   - Checking direct bilirubin today ([**12-25**]), as pt w. decr HCT and
   increased total bili, to rule out hemolysis.
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia

   . Gynecomastia:  Gynecomastia [**2-9**] liver failure and increased estrogen.
   Prolactin elevated. Pt has a history of painful gynecomastia, per pt
   girlfriend.
   - cont tamoxifen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Resolved. Redose meds.
   Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be due to sepsis which
   resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x 2 days (during this
   hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5 [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely
   due to aggressive diuresis in last several days plus IV contrast load
   for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome is also a possibility, given
   Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - d/c albumin
   - monitor UOP closely
   - d/c octreotide
   - diuresis as above
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain and found to have peritonitis as well as a possibility of CAP. He is currently intubated in the ICU due to hypotension and concern for developing respiratory failure.

The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, hypernatremia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, gynecomastia, and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. These conditions are a result of his underlying liver disease and the complications associated with it.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), lasix, and others. He has also received multiple blood product transfusions and has been treated with antibiotics for suspected sepsis and pneumonia.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and a positive Coombs test, suggesting drug-induced hemolytic anemia. Imaging studies reveal signs of pulmonary congestion and moderate ascites with a calculus and echogenic debris in the gallbladder.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 122/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His physical examination shows alertness"

   - extubated
   - very encephalopathic (thinks he's on a space ship--the starry
   backdrop on his TV probably doesn't help).
   - Given rising total bili, we looked at pt's smear, which showed
   spherocytes, target cells, burr cells, no schistocytes. Sent Coombs
   test and direct bili (19.1), to eval for hemolysis. also obtained Abd
   US to eval for patency of portal vasculature: showed patent portal
   vasculature, no intrahepatic duct dilitation, CBD borderline at 7mm,
   likely calculus in GB, GB distension, but without wall changes
   suggestive of cholecystitis.
   - coombs test came back positive -- ? drug-induced hemolytic anemia (as
   t. bili started to rise after zosyn change to cipro/flagyl on night of

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no

   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis/leukocytosis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also
   possibly due to pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors
   and IVF bolus to support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so
   pRBCs were not administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21,
   and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   Octreotide discontinued per hepatology.  Switched Zosyn to Cipro/Clinda
   12/15 per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue cipro/clinda for now, continue for 3 week course
   - Discontinue Midodrine to determine if pressures hold
   - Peritoneal infection appears adequately treated, given recent para
   with WBC 86 (<250).
   - Leukocytosis: Unclear source at present
sputum, blood, urine cultures
   are pending. C. diff has been negative x 2.  As pt has been clinically
   improving over same period, will continue to monitor and keep only
   Cipro/Clinda for now.
   - Broaden abx if pt spikes a fever or decompensate (add back
   Vanc/Zosyn).
   - monitor fever curve, low-grade temps, tachycardia
   - will try to discontinue lines, as patient improves clinically.
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Cipro/Clinda as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - results of recent paracentesis do not suggest on-going intraabdominal
   infection.
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin. Patient delirious since prior to extubation, unclear cause.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, additional AMS w/u if no improvement with tx of
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP. All sedation off
   since [**12-19**].
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - Diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal -1L negative today
   - 5pm lytes
   - continue 100mg daily spironolactone
   - will check an SBT with ABG before and after
   .
   Hypernatremia:  Likely insensitivity to Aldosterone vs. hepatorenal
   syndrome. Currently resolved.  Now hyponatremic.
   - Will continue free water flushes at 300cc q6h.
    - pm electrolyte check
   -  diuresis as above with lasix and spironolactone.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures
   - Checking direct bilirubin today ([**12-25**]), as pt w. decr HCT and
   increased total bili, to rule out hemolysis.
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   - culture of infection

   . Gynecomastia:  Gynecomastia [**2-9**] liver failure and increased estrogen.
   Prolactin elevated. Pt has a history of painful gynecomastia, per pt
   girlfriend.
   - cont tamoxifen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Resolved. Redose meds.
   Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be due to sepsis which
   resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x 2 days (during this
   hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5 [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely
   due to aggressive diuresis in last several days plus IV contrast load
   for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome is also a possibility, given
   Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - d/c albumin
   - monitor UOP closely
   - d/c octreotide
   - diuresis as above
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis, respiratory failure, peritonitis, altered mental status, hypernatremia, anemia, hepatitis C cirrhosis, gynecomastia, acute renal failure, epistaxis, thrombocytopenia, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, and liver failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing care and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of infection and systemic inflammatory response, indicating the possibility of sepsis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive care are necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring due to the risk of worsening respiratory failure. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation support should be provided as needed.
3. Peritonitis: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated white blood cell count suggest peritonitis, which may be secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Appropriate antibiotic therapy and paracentesis may be required.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin to reduce ammonia levels.
5. Hypernatremia: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, varices, and admitted with shortness of breath, abdominal pain, and bloody bowel movements. He was intubated in the emergency department and grew Clostridium perfringens from blood. His peritoneal fluid showed 17,000 white blood cells. He has improved and was extubated yesterday but remains delirious/encephalopathic. He has a positive Coombs test, high indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and large stool output.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 656 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and plateau pressure of 12 cmH2O. His blood gases show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 203 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 41 mmHg.

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Sepsis/leukocytosis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also
   possibly due to pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors
   and IVF bolus to support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so
   pRBCs were not administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21,
   and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   Octreotide discontinued per hepatology.  Switched Zosyn to Cipro/Clinda
   12/15 per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue cipro/clinda for now, continue for 3 week course
   - Discontinue Midodrine to determine if pressures hold
   - Peritoneal infection appears adequately treated, given recent para
   with WBC 86 (<250).
   - Leukocytosis: Unclear source at present
sputum, blood, urine cultures
   are pending. C. diff has been negative x 2.  As pt has been clinically
   improving over same period, will continue to monitor and keep only
   Cipro/Clinda for now.
   - Broaden abx if pt spikes a fever or decompensate (add back
   Vanc/Zosyn).
   - monitor fever curve, low-grade temps, tachycardia
   - will try to discontinue lines, as patient improves clinically.
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Cipro/Clinda as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - results of recent paracentesis do not suggest on-going intraabdominal
   infection.
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin. Patient delirious since prior to extubation, unclear cause.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily.
   - Continue Rifaxamin
   - Can consider head CT, additional AMS w/u if no improvement with tx of
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP. All sedation off
   since [**12-19**].
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - Diurese today with lasix 40mg, goal -1L negative today
   - 5pm lytes
   - continue 100mg daily spironolactone
   - will check an SBT with ABG before and after
   .
   Hypernatremia:  Likely insensitivity to Aldosterone vs. hepatorenal
   syndrome. Currently resolved.  Now hyponatremic.
   - Will continue free water flushes at 300cc q6h.
    - pm electrolyte check
   -  diuresis as above with lasix and spironolactone.
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures
   - Checking direct bilirubin today ([**12-25**]), as pt w. decr HCT and
   increased total bili, to rule out hemolysis.
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   - culture of infection
   - telemetry
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   . Gynecomastia:  Gynecomastia [**2-9**] liver failure and increased estrogen.
   Prolactin elevated. Pt has a history of painful gynecomastia, per pt
   girlfriend.
   - cont tamoxifen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Resolved. Redose meds.
   Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be due to sepsis which
   resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x 2 days (during this
   hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5 [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely
   due to aggressive diuresis in last several days plus IV contrast load
   for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome is also a possibility, given
   Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - d/c albumin
   - monitor UOP closely
   - d/c octreotide
   - diuresis as above
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain and was found to have peritonitis as well as a possibility of CAP. The patient is currently in the ICU for sepsis/leukocytosis, acute respiratory failure, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), chronic and acute anemia due to blood loss, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, gynecomastia, thrombocytopenia, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's severe liver disease and rising bilirubin levels indicate a high risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status and confusion.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and worsening renal function, hepatorenal syndrome is a possibility, which can result in acute renal failure.
3. Infections: The patient has multiple risk factors for infections, including SBP, pneumonia, and a history of hepatitis C. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to prevent and treat any potential infections.
4. Variceal bleeding: The patient's history of esophageal varices puts him at risk for variceal"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Hyperkalemia:  Cause is likely  multi-factorial, including hemolysis,
   increased retention [**2-9**] spironolactone, and decreased stool output
   (though still substantial) [**2-9**] not being given po lactulose.
   - Kayexalate po today, in addition to the 2 doses of PR Kayexalate
   yesterday given PR is less effective and patient is still hyperkalemic
   - Spironolactone d/c
   - Lasix 80mg IV to diurese off sodium
   - q4h lyte check to ensure potassium stabilizes, given significantly
   elevated level
   - If necessary, temporize with sodium bicarbonate, insulin with D50;
   avoid calcium gluconate today given hypercalcemia
   - Consider D5 with bicarb for both shifting K into cell and fluid
   recuscitation with aggressive Lasix diuresis
   - I/O check later today
   .
   Sepsis/leukocytosis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also
   possibly due to pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors
   and IVF bolus to support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so
   pRBCs were not administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21,
   and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   Octreotide discontinued per hepatology.  Switched Zosyn to Cipro/Clinda
   12/15 per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin
   - Continue cipro/clinda for now, continue for 3 week course
   - Continue Midodrine and wean off pressors (Neo) as necessary; if
   cannot take Midodrine po, consider NGT placement
   - Peritoneal infection appears adequately treated, given recent para
   with WBC 86 (<250).
   - Leukocytosis: Unclear source at present
sputum, blood, urine cultures
   are pending. C. diff negative x 2.  As pt has been clinically improving
   over same period, will continue to monitor and keep only Cipro/Clinda
   for now.
   - Broaden abx if pt spikes a fever or decompensate (add back
   Vanc/Zosyn).
   - monitor fever curve, low-grade temps, tachycardia
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  WBC high but improved from
   prior, obtaining CT scan to further evaluate, as outlined above.
   - Cipro/Clinda as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Regla for now
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - results of recent paracentesis do not suggest on-going intraabdominal
   infection.
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin. Patient delirious since prior to extubation, unclear cause.
   Patient now appears more delirious vs. psychotic rather than
   encephalopathic, unclear if he has a prior psych history.
   - Titrate up Lactulose to 3 BMs daily as tolerated by po intake

   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP. All sedation off
   since [**12-19**].  Extubated with significantly improved respiratory status.
   - ABG and lactate daily (lactate down-trending now)
   - Diurese today with lasix 80mg IV x1, goal to decrease K+
   - q4h lytes as above
   - D/C
ed 100mg daily spironolactone
   .
   Hyponatremia/Hypernatremia:  Likely insensitivity to Aldosterone vs.
   hepatorenal syndrome. Currently resolved.  Now hyponatremic.  Now with
   hyponatremia.
   - Will continue free water flushes at 300cc q6h.
   -  diuresis as above with lasix
   - d/c spironolactone
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Daily coags and CBC; Transfuse as needed for falling Hct.
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures
   - Checking direct bilirubin today ([**12-25**]), as pt w. decr HCT and
   increased total bili, to rule out hemolysis.
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 think likely due to pain component, as patient appears
   uncomfortable and thrashes about when tachycardic
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   - culture of infection
   - telemetry
   .
   . Gynecomastia:  Gynecomastia [**2-9**] liver failure and increased estrogen.
   Prolactin elevated. Pt has a history of painful gynecomastia, per pt
   girlfriend.
   - cont tamoxifen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Resolved. Redose meds.
   Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be due to sepsis which
   resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x 2 days (during this
   hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5 [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely
   due to aggressive diuresis in last several days plus IV contrast load
   for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome is also a possibility, given
   Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved UOP [**12-21**].
   - F/u renal recs.
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - d/c albumin
   - monitor UOP closely
   - d/c octreotide
   - diuresis as above
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont Epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Consider D5W today, replete electrolytes.  TPN without K.
   Consider NGT placement for po meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and hyponatremia. He was admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain. The patient was found to have peritonitis, as well as a possibility of CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia). He is currently in the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute hypernatremia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), chronic anemia, acute blood loss anemia, and hepatitis C cirrhosis.

The patient's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be around 25-30, and was 21 on admission. He has chronic macrocytic anemia secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia from variceal bleeding or bleeding ulcer. No bleeding source was found during an EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy) evaluation for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

The patient's bilirubin levels are elevated, indicating jaundice. His liver function tests (LFTs) are similar to previous results, except for the markedly elevated total bilirubin level. The patient reportedly stopped drinking alcohol in November. Hepatology recommendations include lactulose and rifaximin.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/48 mmHg to "

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis who presented with septic shock caused by Clostridium perfringens. He is now extubated and showing improvement, but remains delirious and delusional. The patient has intermittent hot nodules (HOTN) and is unable to take oral medications due to his condition. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 36.1°C, heart rate between 77-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65-127 mmHg, respiratory rate at 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has increased from 91.7 kg at admission to 100.6 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,208 mL and output of 950 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 13 mmHg. He is receiving phenylephrine infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications including pantoprazole, dextrose 50%, sodium bicarbonate, and protonix. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 17.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, platelet count of 60 K/uL, creatinine level of 1"

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Hyperkalemia:  Cause is likely multi-factorial, including hemolysis,
   increased retention [**2-9**] spironolactone, and decreased stool output
   (though still substantial) [**2-9**] not being given po lactulose, and ARF
   ([**2-9**] ATN, hypotension). s/p calcium gluconate, Kayexalate, lasix,
   D50/insulin, sodium bicarb.
   - continue CVVH
   - appreciate renal recs
   - q6h lyte checks with CVVH
   .
   Sepsis/leukocytosis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also
   possibly due to pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors
   and IVF bolus to support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so
   pRBCs were not administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21,
   and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   Octreotide discontinued per hepatology.  Switched Zosyn to Cipro/Clinda
   12/15 per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin. Hypotensive on
   [**12-27**]
 required pressor support x3; started vanc/zosyn/flagyl for
   broad-spectrum coverage. s/p diagnostic para on [**12-27**]
 70 polys.
   Lactate elevated.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl for broad coverage
   - Continue Midodrine
   - Continue neo, levo, vasopressin for MAP >65.
   - monitor fever curve, low-grade temps, tachycardia
   - f/u CT torso final read
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  Leukocytosis, hypotension, s/p
   diagnostic para on [**12-27**].
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Reglan for now
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - f/u CT torso read
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP. All sedation off
   since [**12-19**].  Extubated with significantly improved respiratory status.
   Then incr work of breathing, AMS, pressor requirement, hypercarbia, so
   intubated on [**12-27**].
   - noon ABG
   - daily lactate
   - hold on diuresis today
   - vanc/zosyn/flagyl
   - appears to need PEEP, wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - CVVH
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin. Patient delirious since prior to extubation, unclear cause.
   Patient now appears more delirious vs. psychotic rather than
   encephalopathic, unclear if he has a prior psych history.
   - Currently intubated; unable to assess delirium
   - minimal sedation use as tolerated, given hepatic disease and also
   previously took long time for patient to wake up s/p stopping sedation
   - ??? lactulose/rifaximin
   - Can consider head CT, additional AMS w/u if no improvement with tx of
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved
   UOP [**12-21**]. Urine output dropped off precipitously on [**12-27**]
 renal
   aware. Concern for hypotension-induced renal failure, failure d/t
   intraabdominal pressure/process, ATN.
   - continue CVVH
   - appreciate renal & hepatology recs
   - monitor UOP closely
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable. 300cc blood suctioned from oropharynx in setting of intubation
   on [**12-27**] but Hct stable.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] CBC today, and hemolysis labs (bili fractionated, haptoglobin,
   LDH, retic) per hematology
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 concern d/t pain versus fever/infection
   - fentanyl boluses prn
   - antibiotics as above
   - telemetry
   .
   . Gynecomastia:  Gynecomastia [**2-9**] liver failure and increased estrogen.
   Prolactin elevated. Pt has a history of painful gynecomastia.
   - s/p tamoxifen
   .
   Hyponatremia/Hypernatremia:  Likely insensitivity to Aldosterone vs.
   hepatorenal syndrome. Currently resolved.
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: Consider D5W today, replete electrolytes.  TPN without K.  OG tube
   in place.
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots

   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p interferon rx with no
   response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices and hyponatremia admitted with
   dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain, found to have peritonitis as well
   as a possibility of CAP.
   .
   Patient is critically ill
 concern for intraabdominal pathology
   resulting in hypotension/sepsis/lactic acidosis/respiratory failure. On
   3 pressors, still hypotensive. Hyperkalemic, getting CVVH. Family in
   process of being notified. Believe peritonitis or bowel ischemia to be
   causative, or acalculous cholecystitis or aspiration pneumonia. ARF
   with precipitous decr UO yesterday. Intubated.
   .
   Hyperkalemia:  Cause is likely multi-factorial, including hemolysis,
   increased retention [**2-9**] spironolactone, and decreased stool output
   (though still substantial) [**2-9**] not being given po lactulose, and ARF
   ([**2-9**] ATN, hypotension). s/p calcium gluconate, Kayexalate, lasix,
   D50/insulin, sodium bicarb. Etiology -?cell lysis, ?ARF.
   - continue CVVH
   - appreciate renal recs
   - q6h lyte checks with CVVH
   .
   Sepsis/leukocytosis: Suspect sepsis is due to SBP as below, also
   possibly due to pna. Will treat with abx as outlined below, pressors
   and IVF bolus to support BP. Mixed venous O2 sat in ED was 91%, so
   pRBCs were not administered, however hematocrit on admission was ~21,
   and pt was transfused. Hypothermia (current temp 95 with bear hugger),
   hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia consistent with sepsis, but
   also concerning for adrenal insufficiency. Pt has not recently been on
   steroids and has no other RF for adrenal insufficiency.  BCx grew
   Clostridium Perfringens [**12-13**].  d/c
ed cisatracurium. s/p CT abdomen on
   [**12-17**].  Pressors off as of [**12-20**].  Steroids dc
ed as of [**12-21**].
   Octreotide discontinued per hepatology.  Switched Zosyn to Cipro/Clinda
   12/15 per ID recs; dc
ed Vanc, Clindamycin, Micafungin. Hypotensive on
   [**12-27**]
 required pressor support x3; started vanc/zosyn/flagyl for
   broad-spectrum coverage. s/p diagnostic para on [**12-27**]
 70% polys =
   peritonitis. Lactate elevated.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl for broad coverage
   - Check vanco dosing
   - Continue Midodrine
   - Continue neo, levo, vasopressin for MAP >65.
   - Start epinephrine IV
   - Give 1 L NS to monitor for BP response to fluids
   - monitor fever curve, low-grade temps, tachycardia
   - f/u CT torso final read
   - 2 units blood transfuse
   .
   Peritonitis: ?SBP but without positive cultures.  Abdominal pain,
   prominent neutrophilia on ascitic fluid diff (17,000 WBC, 87% neuts)
   and significant left-shift on CBC with diff (33% bands) in the setting
   of a history of variceal bleeding are all consistent with SBP. Normally
   would treat with ceftriaxone, but given additional concerns for
   pneumonia will treat with cipro, pip-tazo and vancomycin. Hepatobiliary
   sx recs ([**12-15**]): recommend re-tapping him today.  If his WBC is still
   very high, he may need to be explored.  Leukocytosis, hypotension, s/p
   diagnostic para on [**12-27**]. Concern peritonitis is source of
   hypotension/sepsis.
   - Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl as above
   - Abdomen continues to be significantly distended; holding
   Metoclopramide/Reglan/Lactulose for now
   - f/u GI/Liver recs
   - f/u transplant surgery recs
   - f/u CT torso read
   - Give stress steroids, hydrocortisone 50 IV q6h
   .
   Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated in the ED given
   hypotension, concern for developing respiratory failure given
   tachypnea. ABG in MICU indicates elevated PaO2 on current ventilator
   settings.  The differential for the pt's dyspnea includes pneumonia,
   influenza, ascites or CHF. The pt had a left shift on CBC with diff and
   his girlfriend reported that he recently had a ""respiratory infection""
   which raises concern for a post-viral pna or bacterial pna. Initial
   read of CXR raised concern for R LL infiltrate, however on final read
   there is no mention of an opacity. Tachypnea likely secondary to
   acidosis.  Also evidence of volume overload and CHF given edema, CXR
   consistent with fluid overload, and elevated CVP. All sedation off
   since [**12-19**].  Extubated with significantly improved respiratory status.
   Then incr work of breathing, AMS, pressor requirement, hypercarbia, so
   intubated on [**12-27**]. PEEP at 10 now, need to balance respiratory status
   with incr PEEP versus hypotension seen with incr PEEP.
   - Keep PEEP at 10, and incr FiO2 to 100% d/t desat
   - repeat ABG in 1 hour
   - [**Hospital1 **] lactate
   - hold on diuresis today
   - vanc/zosyn/flagyl
   - CVVH
   .
   Altered mental status: Pt is still with decreased mental status despite
   being off of sedation x 1 day on [**12-19**]. Neurologic exam difficult, but
   no obvious deficit. The most likely etiology at this point is stage 4
   hepatic encephalopathy, given patient
s severe liver disease and rising
   bilirubin. Patient delirious since prior to extubation, unclear cause.
   Patient now appears more delirious vs. psychotic rather than
   encephalopathic, unclear if he has a prior psych history.
   - Currently intubated; unable to assess delirium
   - minimal sedation use as tolerated, given hepatic disease and also
   previously took long time for patient to wake up s/p stopping sedation
   - hold lactulose/rifaximin
   - Can consider head CT, additional AMS w/u if no improvement with tx of
   hepatic encephalopathy.
   - bolus versed now (consider fentanyl or propofol prn)
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: Patient initially had elevated Cr, thought to be
   due to sepsis which resolved).  Pt
s creatinine has been rising again x
   2 days (during this hospitalization, Cr 1.7 -> 0.8 -> today 1.5
   [**12-19**]).  ARF most likely due to aggressive diuresis in last several
   days plus IV contrast load for CT abd.  However, hepatorenal syndrome
   is also a possibility, given Midodrine, Octreotide, Albumin.  Improved
   UOP [**12-21**]. Urine output dropped off precipitously on [**12-27**]
 renal
   aware. Concern for hypotension-induced renal failure, failure d/t
   intraabdominal pressure/process, ATN.
   - continue CVVH
   - appreciate renal & hepatology recs
   - monitor UOP closely
   .
   Anemia: Pt's recent baseline hematocrit appears to be ~25-30, and was
   21 on admission. Pt was noted to be guaiac positive on exam in ED, and
   had frank blood in NGT. Suspect that pt has chronic macrocytic anemia
   secondary to liver disease, with superimposed acute blood loss anemia
   from variceal bleed or bleeding ulcer. No schistocytes on smear to
   indicate hemolysis, however INR more elevated than in the past, and
   thrombocytopenia is more pronounced. GI did an EGD to evaluate for UGIB
   cause and no bleeding source was found.  Pt was on pantoprazole bolus
   and octreotide gtt for likely variceal bleeding: d/c
d now as HCT
   stable. 300cc blood suctioned from oropharynx in setting of intubation
   on [**12-27**] but Hct stable, now another 200cc in that tube this AM.
   - Continue IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] CBC today, and hemolysis labs (bili fractionated, haptoglobin,
   LDH, retic) per hematology, and fibrinogen and coags
   - 2 units FFP prior to any procedures
   - 2 units blood now
   .
   Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: MELD on admission was 27, discriminate function
   was 61. On exam pt is jaundiced. LFT's similar to prior LFT's with the
   exception of bili, which is markedly elevated at 18. Reportedly the pt
   stopped drinking EtOH in [**Month (only) 11**]. Serum EtOH was negative.
   - F/u Hepatology recs
   - Lactulose and Rifaximin
   - Hold nadolol for now given hypotension, pressor requirement
   .
   Less Active Issues
   .
   #. Tachycardia
 concern d/t pain versus fever/infection
   - sedation as above
   - antibiotics as above
   - telemetry
   .
   . Gynecomastia:  Gynecomastia [**2-9**] liver failure and increased estrogen.
   Prolactin elevated. Pt has a history of painful gynecomastia.
   - s/p tamoxifen
   .
   Hyponatremia/Hypernatremia:  Likely insensitivity to Aldosterone vs.
   hepatorenal syndrome. Currently resolved.
   .
   Epistaxis:  ENT consulted, patient s/p bilateral packing.
   - cont epistaxis precautions
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Currently plts are 34, which is below baseline.
   Suspect that thrombocytopenia is due to poor synthetic function in the
   setting of liver disease. Pt has chronic epistaxis. Hemolysis is less
   likely.  Smear showed: no schistocytes, a few large platelets but many
   small platelets.  Likely bone marrow difficulty with production at the
   same time as it tries to increase production in the setting of platelet
   destruction.
   - Trend plts daily
   - Avoid heparin products in the setting of plt<100, GIB
   .
   Non-anion gap Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved. pH on ABG 7.29. Pt has a
   normal anion gap in the setting of chronic hyponatremia. Suspect
   acidosis is secondary to lactic acidosis in the setting of sepsis,
   SBP.  s/p 2 units PRBC transfusion.
   - frequent ABG's
   - hold maintenance fluids to avoid worsening of acidosis
   - add on alk phos and CEA to ascitic fluid analysis given GI/Liver
   service's concern for perforation
   - f/u renal recs, likely no need for HD now
   .
   FEN: 1L NS now. CVVH. Hold TPN. OG tube in place.
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   Access: R triple-lumen IJ, a-line, peripheral IVs, R femoral line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatitis C. He presented to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), acute kidney injury (AKI), anemia secondary to blood loss, thrombocytopenia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient required invasive ventilation and dialysis catheter placement. He is currently on multiple antibiotics and vasopressors for blood pressure support. His laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low fibrinogen, and rising lactate levels. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing hypotension, hyperkalemia, and worsening renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction, hepatic encephalopathy is a potential complication. This can manifest as altered mental status and confusion.
2. Hepato-renal syndrome: The patient's liver disease and acute kidney injury may progress to hepatorenal syndrome, which is characterized by worsening renal function despite adequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of invasive lines and catheters.
4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The massively distended gallbladder seen on imaging suggests the possibility of cholecystitis, which could lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and the need for invasive ventilation put him at risk for developing ARDS, which is characterized by severe lung injury and impaired oxygenation.
6. Hepatic hydrothorax: The presence of bilateral moderate pleural effusions raises the possibility of hepatic hydrothorax, a complication of cirrhosis that leads to fluid accumulation in the pleural space."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis. SBP can lead to sepsis, especially if not treated promptly. The patient's rising lactate levels and worsening condition indicate the possibility of sepsis.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, suggesting respiratory failure. The cause of respiratory failure may be due to severe shunting, possibly associated with cirrhosis or sepsis. It is important to manage the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters carefully.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has hyperkalemia and acute renal failure. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has been initiated, suggesting the need for renal support. AKI could be due to hypoperfusion from sepsis or hepatorenal syndrome secondary to cirrhosis.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and low albumin levels suggest the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition is associated with liver dysfunction and requires careful management of electrolytes and toxins.

5. Bleeding tendency: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of blood loss suggest an increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring"
