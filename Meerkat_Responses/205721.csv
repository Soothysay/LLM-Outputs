   Assessment and Plan
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
   51 year old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated
   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**]
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle.
   - Continue midodrine, increase to 15mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Give albumin 50g IV tonight
   - Pressors for procedures prn, with goal MAP >65; phenylephrine [neo]
   1st choice (due to normal-to-high CO and low SVR), norepinephrine
   [levo] 2nd choice.
   - Hold on IVF for now, given elevated CVP
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: MELD score based on [**10-27**] labs was 42.
   Patient currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically symptoms
   of acute liver decompensation. Patient has been evaluated by the
   transplant team as an outpatient who recommended admission for possible
   tranplant based on elevated MELD score. Plan for EGD and dobhoff
   placement today otherwise transplant eval is apparently complete.
   - EGD and dobhoff placement today, NPO at midnight
   - Check AM INR and give FFP for procedures, pending proceduralists'
   preferences
   - Consent for blood products
   - Restart lactulose 15mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Increase rifaximin to 400mg tid
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for SBP pxs - ask pharmacy/hepatology re: dose
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs
   .
   # Hepatorenal Syndrome: Creatinine on transfer to MICU 4.2. Requires
   dialysis three times a week. Patient is candidate for dual liver-renal
   transplant and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**].
   - Continue midodrine
   - Continue sevelamer and nephrocaps
   - Give albumin tonight
   - f/u renal recs
   - Plan for UF with some HD today
   - Giving 1 unit pRBC this morning, per renal
   - Epo with HD for anemia of ESRD, MWF
   .
   # Alcohol abuse: Patient has not had a drink since [**Month (only) 93**], therefore no
   need for CIWA.
   - Continue Folic Acid, Thiamine, MVI
   .
   FEN: Renal diet. NPO at midnight for am EGD. Plan for Dobhoff today.
   - Consult nutrition for poor po intake, low albumin, and tube feeding
   recommendations once Dobhoff placed
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with Pneumoboots
   -omeprazole 20mg daily
   -clotrimazole trocs
   -Bowel regimen senna prn, lactulose.
   .
   ACCESS: Power PICC, L IJ HD catheter. Consider A-line for close BP
   monitoring during procedures.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She is currently being evaluated for a possible liver transplant and has been admitted due to high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The patient also has hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which requires dialysis three times a week. She is a candidate for dual liver-renal transplant.

The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is believed to be due to fluid redistribution from the intravascular to extravascular compartments. To manage this, the plan includes continuing midodrine, increasing the dose to 15 mg, giving albumin 50g IV tonight, and using pressors (phenylephrine as the first choice and norepinephrine as the second choice) for procedures to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65.

The patient's end-stage liver disease has a MELD score based on previous labs of 42. She is currently stable, fully oriented, and without any clinically symptomatic acute liver decompensation. The plan includes an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and Dobhoff placement today, as well as restarting lactulose and increasing rifaximin. The patient is also being consented for blood products, and her INR will be checked before procedures.

The patient's hepatorenal syndrome requires continuous monitoring and management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis, complicated by hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She has been admitted with a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, indicating a high priority for possible liver transplant. The patient's current condition includes severe jaundice, dry mucous membranes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lower extremity edema, and hypotension. Her laboratory results show elevated levels of bilirubin, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient requires ongoing dialysis and close monitoring of her blood pressure. She is currently receiving midodrine, albumin, and pressors for blood pressure support. Additional plans include an endoscopic gastric bypass (EGD) and Dobhoff catheter placement for nutritional support, as well as further evaluation for liver transplant. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure and significant ascites/peripheral edema suggest fluid redistribution from intravascular to extravascular compartments. Close monitoring of blood pressure and potential administration of pressors may be necessary to prevent hypotension during procedures or workup for transplant.
2. Acute Liver Decompensation: Despite the patient currently being stable and fully oriented, there is a risk of acute liver decompensation due to her ESLD. Close monitoring of liver function and management of complications such as hepatic en"

 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
   51 year old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated
   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle.
   - Increase midodrine to 15mg tid
   - Pressors for procedures prn, with goal MAP >65; phenylephrine [neo]
   1st choice (due to normal-to-high CO and low SVR), norepinephrine
   [levo] 2nd choice. Wean neo today as tolerated (but getting HD today,
   so cautiously).
   - Hold on IVF for now, given elevated CVP
   - f/u with hepatology and renal recs
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: MELD score based on [**11-7**] labs = 40.
   Patient currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically symptoms
   of acute liver decompensation. Patient has been evaluated by the
   transplant team as an outpatient who recommended admission for possible
   tranplant based on elevated MELD score. Plan for EGD and dobhoff
   placement today otherwise transplant eval is apparently complete.
   Listed for transplant for kidney/liver.
   - EGD and Dobhoff done on [**11-7**]
   - Continue lactulose 15mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue rifaximin to 400mg tid
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for SBP pxs - ask pharmacy/hepatology re: dose
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - tubefeeds slowly today; zofran prn nausea
   - no need for transfusion today
   .
   # Hepatorenal Syndrome: Creatinine on transfer to MICU 4.2. Requires
   dialysis three times a week. Patient is candidate for dual liver-renal
   transplant and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**].
   - Continue midodrine
   - Continue sevelamer and nephrocaps
   - s/p albumin on [**11-7**]
   - f/u renal and hepatology recs
   - HD today
   - Epo with HD for anemia of ESRD, MWF
   .
   # Alcohol abuse: Patient has not had a drink since [**Month (only) 93**], therefore no
   need for CIWA.
   - Continue Folic Acid, Thiamine, MVI
   .
   FEN: Renal diet. PO ok.
   - Tubefeeds per nutrition recs.

","The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She has been admitted for possible liver/kidney transplant due to a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The patient is also experiencing hepatorenal syndrome, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, and alteration in nutrition.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient has a nasogastric (NG) tube in place, which is running at 10 cc/hour. She is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through a Dobhoff catheter. The patient is on multiple medications, including midodrine, norepinephrine, octreotide, lactulose, rifaximin, ciprofloxacin, and others.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal coagulation profile, hypoglycemia, and hypoalbuminemia. The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 4.8 mg/dL, indicating renal dysfunction.

   51 year old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated
   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Gave albumin 50g IV [**11-6**]; f/u hepatology regarding giving more today
   - Pressors for procedures prn, with goal MAP >65; phenylephrine [neo]
   1st choice (due to normal-to-high CO and low SVR), norepinephrine
   [levo] 2nd choice.
   - Hold on IVF for now, given elevated CVP
   - f/u with hepatology re: giving octreotide
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: MELD score based on [**11-7**] labs = 40.
   Patient currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically symptoms
   of acute liver decompensation. Patient has been evaluated by the
   transplant team as an outpatient who recommended admission for possible
   tranplant based on elevated MELD score. Plan for EGD and dobhoff
   placement today otherwise transplant eval is apparently complete.
   - EGD and Dobhoff placement today, NPO since midnight
   - Give FFP now prior to procedures, per hepatology
   - Continue lactulose 15mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue rifaximin to 400mg tid
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for SBP pxs - ask pharmacy/hepatology re: dose
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs

   # Hepatorenal Syndrome: Creatinine on transfer to MICU 4.2. Requires
   dialysis three times a week. Patient is candidate for dual liver-renal
   transplant and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**].

   # Alcohol abuse: Patient has not had a drink since [**Month (only) 93**], therefore no
   need for CIWA.
   - Continue Folic Acid, Thiamine, MVI

She has been admitted with a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for possible transplant evaluation but has not been able to undergo testing due to hypotension. 

The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, renal failure, and HRS. She also has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently on several medications, including midodrine, albumin, phenylephrine, norepinephrine, lactulose, rifaximin, ciprofloxacin, folic acid, thiamine, and MVI.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, as well as impaired kidney function. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she is at risk for hypotension, especially during procedures. She has a power PICC line and a left internal jugular vein hemodialysis catheter in place.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her liver and kidney functions. She is currently on a renal diet and is NPO since midnight for an upcoming endoscopy procedure. Once the Dobhoff tube is placed, she will be able to restart tube feeds per nutrition recommendations.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of EtOH cirrhosis who was admitted to the MICU with persistent hypotension. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her condition.

1. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has cirrhosis, which indicates impaired liver function. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased risk of infections.

2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has jaundice and right and left lower extremity edema, suggesting possible ascites and peripheral edema due to liver disease. These can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and other skin-related issues.

3. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to her condition. This can result in malnutrition and further complications.

4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for fluid removal, indicating acute renal failure. This can be a result of hepatorenal syndrome or another cause of kidney dysfunction.

5. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and acute renal failure, there is a possibility of hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure that occurs in advanced liver disease.

6. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which requires continuous infusion of vasopressors like lev"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
   51 year old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated
   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle.
   - Increase midodrine to 15mg tid
   - Pressors for procedures prn, with goal MAP >65; phenylephrine [neo]
   1st choice (due to normal-to-high CO and low SVR), norepinephrine
   [levo] 2nd choice. Wean neo today as tolerated (but getting HD today,
   so cautiously).
   - Hold on IVF for now, given elevated CVP
   - f/u with hepatology and renal recs
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: MELD score based on [**11-7**] labs = 40.
   Patient currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically symptoms
   of acute liver decompensation. Patient has been evaluated by the
   transplant team as an outpatient who recommended admission for possible
   tranplant based on elevated MELD score. Plan for EGD and dobhoff
   placement today otherwise transplant eval is apparently complete.
   Listed for transplant for kidney/liver.
   - EGD and Dobhoff done on [**11-7**]
   - Continue lactulose 15mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue rifaximin to 400mg tid
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for SBP px
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - tubefeeds slowly today; zofran prn nausea
   - no need for transfusion today
   .
   # Hepatorenal Syndrome: Creatinine on transfer to MICU 4.2. Requires
   dialysis three times a week. Patient is candidate for dual liver-renal
   transplant and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**].
   - Continue midodrine
   - Holding sevelamer given pt

   admission to the MICU.
   .
   DISPOSITION: MICU until can wean off pressors.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She also has hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and requires dialysis. The patient was admitted for a possible liver transplant evaluation due to a high MELD score but has not been able to undergo testing yet.

The patient's current medical conditions and plans include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is believed to be due to fluid redistribution from the intravascular to extravascular compartments. The goal is to continue ESLD work-up without hypotension or light-headedness as an obstacle. Midodrine has been increased to 15mg tid, and pressors will be used for procedures as needed, with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. Phenylephrine is the first choice, followed by norepinephrine if needed.
2. End-stage liver disease: The patient's MELD score is 40 based on labs from [**11-7**]. She is stable, fully oriented, and without symptoms of acute liver decompensation. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) and Dobhoff tube placement were done on [**11-7**]. The patient continues lactulose at 15mg daily, rifaximin at 400mg tid, ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and is listed for a kidney/liver transplant.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient requires dialysis three times a week. She is a candidate for dual liver-renal transplant and is being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**]. Midodrine will be continued, and sevelamer will be held due to the patient's hypophosphatemia. Nephrocaps should be continued, and albumin should be administered today. The patient will have hemodialysis (HD) today and will receive epo with HD for anemia of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Phosphate repletion should also be aggressive.
4. Alcohol abuse: The patient has not consumed alcohol since [**Month (only) 93**], so there is no need for CIWA.
5. Other plans include a renal diet, tube feeds per nutrition recommendations, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pneumonia.
6. Access points include a power PICC and a left internal jugular (IJ) hemodialysis catheter.
7. Code status is full code, confirmed with the patient. The emergency contact is [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 4887**], and the patient's husband, [**Name (NI) 117**], can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9887**]."

 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
   51 year old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated
   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle.
   - Increased midodrine to 15mg tid
   - Goal MAP >65; on norepinephrine [levo]. Wean today as tolerated.
   - f/u with hepatology and renal recs
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: MELD score based on [**11-7**] labs = 40.
   Patient currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically symptoms
   of acute liver decompensation. Patient has been evaluated by the
   transplant team as an outpatient who recommended admission for possible
   tranplant based on elevated MELD score. Plan for EGD and dobhoff
   placement today otherwise transplant eval is apparently complete.
   Listed for transplant for kidney/liver.
   - EGD and Dobhoff done on [**11-7**]; OK to feed through dobhoff so long as
   flowing freely.
   - Continue lactulose 15mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue rifaximin to 400mg tid
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for SBP px
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - tubefeeds slowly today; zofran prn nausea
   - no need for transfusion today
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Could be due to UF, but given concern for infection in
   setting of plan for transplant, will pan-culture patient, send C. Diff,
   and obtain a CXR.
   - follow up CXR, sputum, blood and urine cultures, C. diff toxin
   .
   # Hepatorenal Syndrome: Creatinine on transfer to MICU 4.2. Requires
   dialysis three times a week. Patient is candidate for dual liver-renal
   transplant and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**].
   - Continue midodrine

   - HD today
   - Epo with HD for anemia of ESRD, MWF
   - replete phos
   .
   # Alcohol abuse: Patient has not had a drink since [**Month (only) 93**], therefore no
   need for CIWA.
   - Continue Folic Acid, Thiamine, MVI

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old female with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis.
- She has hepatorenal syndrome and requires dialysis.
- The patient is listed for a kidney/liver transplant.
- She is currently in the ICU and is being managed for hypotension with pressors and fluids.
- Her liver function abnormalities and renal failure are being monitored closely.
- She has leukocytosis, which could be due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding or infection.
- The patient is also being evaluated for alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which can be attributed to fluid redistribution from the intravascular to extravascular compartments in the context of ESLD. Close monitoring of blood pressure and the use of pressors are being utilized to manage this condition.

2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute renal failure (acute kidney injury) and requires dialysis three times a week. This indicates compromised kidney function, which can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for renal replacement therapy.

3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, a condition where liver dysfunction leads to kidney failure. This syndrome requires close monitoring and management of both liver and renal functions.

4. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an underlying infection. Given"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis admitted to the MICU with persistent hypotension. She has liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, acute renal failure, and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for fluid removal and significant doses of vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to impaired immune function and prolonged exposure to invasive lines and catheters.

2. Bleeding: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal with prolonged PT/INR, indicating an increased risk of bleeding. This can be exacerbated by the use of anticoagulant medications during CRRT.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction may lead to the accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream, resulting in altered mental status and hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Hepatorenal syndrome: This condition involves a worsening of renal function secondary to liver disease. It can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.

5. Malnutrition: The patient's impaired nutritional status may increase the risk of further complications and prolonged recovery.

6. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires ongoing management with vasopressors, which carries its own risks, such as organ ischemia and multiorgan dysfunction.

   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle.

   Patient currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically symptoms
   of acute liver decompensation. Patient has been evaluated by the
   transplant team as an outpatient who recommended admission for possible
   tranplant based on elevated MELD score. Plan for EGD and dobhoff
   placement today otherwise transplant eval is apparently complete.
   Listed for transplant for kidney/liver.
   - EGD and Dobhoff done on [**11-7**]; OK to feed through Dobhoff so long as
   flowing freely.
   - Continue lactulose 15mg [**Hospital1 **]

   #. Leukocytosis: Could be due to UF, but given concern for infection in
   setting of plan for transplant, looking for infectious source too.
   - follow up sputum, blood and urine cultures
   - send C. diff test

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She is complicated by Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS), requiring dialysis, and is listed for possible transplant. The patient was admitted due to high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score for potential transplant evaluation but has not been able to undergo testing due to hypotension.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, end-stage liver disease, leukocytosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and nausea. The assessment and plan include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is believed to be due to redistribution of fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 using norepinephrine and possibly midodrine. Pressors will be weaned as tolerated.

2. End-stage liver disease: The patient has a MELD score of 40, which indicates a high severity of liver disease. She is currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically evident acute liver decompensation. The patient has been evaluated by the transplant team as an outpatient and recommended admission for possible transplant. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and Dobhoff catheter placement were done on [**11-7**], allowing for feeding through the Dobhoff catheter"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She is currently in the ICU for possible liver transplant but has not been able to undergo testing due to hypotension. The patient is also experiencing renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is believed to be due to redistribution of fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as evidenced by significant ascites/peripheral edema. Close BP monitoring and the use of pressors will be necessary to manage this condition.

2. Liver Transplant: The patient is listed for liver transplant, but she has not been able to undergo testing due to hypotension. If the patient's condition stabilizes, she may require a liver transplant to address her ESLD.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is further complicated by HRS. This requires ongoing management, including dialysis three times a week. The patient is also a candidate for dual liver-renal transplant.

4. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, as indicated by plate atelectasis on the left base seen on chest X-ray. This condition requires careful monitoring and supportive care, including oxygen supplementation and possibly mechanical ventilation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol (EtOH) cirrhosis.
- She was admitted to the MICU with persistent hypotension.
- The patient has liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, and acute renal failure.
- Hepatorenal syndrome has been diagnosed.
- The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and has had about 5 liters of fluid removed since initiating.
- There is a discussion with the renal and hepatology teams about the possibility of [Initials (NamePattern4)] [Last Name (NamePattern4)] given the significant nausea, which would allow us to decrease levophed.
- The patient's nausea is being managed with increased Zofran to standing 8mg q8 hours and morphine as needed.
- The rest of the issues are being managed by the ICU team.
- The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome: This is a serious complication of advanced liver disease, where the kidneys fail due to the liver's inability to produce enough blood-clotting proteins.
2. Infection: Due to impaired skin integrity, the patient is at risk for infections, particularly in the ICU setting.
3. Variceal bleeding: Patients with cirrhosis are at risk for bleeding from enlarged veins in the esophagus or stomach.

 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
   51 year old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated
   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg tid
   - Goal MAP >65; on norepinephrine [levo]. Wean today as tolerated
   (albeit given nausea/vomiting and CVVH difficult to wean).
   - f/u with hepatology and renal recs
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: MELD score based on [**11-7**] labs = 40.
   Patient currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically symptoms
   of acute liver decompensation. Patient has been evaluated by the
   transplant team as an outpatient who recommended admission for possible
   tranplant based on elevated MELD score. s/p EGD on [**11-7**]. s/p dobhoff
   placement on [**11-7**]. Listed for transplant for kidney/liver.  MELD [**11-11**]
   = 42.
   - EGD and Dobhoff done on [**11-7**]; OK to feed through Dobhoff so long as
   flowing freely.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue rifaximin to 400mg tid
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for SBP pxs
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - no need for transfusion today
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Could be due to UF, but given concern for infection in
   setting of plan for transplant, looking for infectious source too.  C.
   diff negative.  Possible SBP given leukocytosis and tender abdomen, but
   no fever or clear evidence of SBP.
   - follow up cultures
   - C. diff negative
   - Contact hepatology re: utility of paracentesis for ?SBP
   .
   # Renal Failure: Creatinine on transfer to MICU 4.2. Requires dialysis
   three times a week. Patient is candidate for dual liver-renal
   transplant and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**].
   - Holding sevelamer given pt
s hypophosphatemia
   - continue nephrocaps
   - s/p albumin on [**11-7**], no albumin needed as pt w. chronic renal
   insufficiency
   - f/u renal recs
   - Epo with HD for anemia of ESRD, MWF
   - continue CVVH; discuss with renal re: CVVH holiday and decreasing
   pressor requirement, given patient net >4L negative over ICU stay and
   also rather nauseous, a CVVH holiday might help her feel better
   .
   # Nausea: Perhaps due to liver disease, pressor, CVVH, medications.
   - Zofran 8mg q8h IV standing
   - Morphine; decrease dose to 0.5-1mg IV q4h prn from 1-2mg IV q4h prn
   - Hold on ativan if possible, given ESLD
   - Restart TF
s slowly as tolerated, after nausea more controlled later
   today
   .
   # Alcohol abuse: Patient has not had a drink since [**Month (only) 93**], therefore no
   need for CIWA.
   - Continue Folic Acid, Thiamine, MVI
   .
   FEN: Renal diet. PO ok.  Dobhoff in place.
   - Tubefeeds per nutrition recs, slowly given nausea.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease secondary to alcohol cirrhosis, complicated by hepatorenal syndrome requiring dialysis. She has been admitted for possible liver and kidney transplant. The patient is currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically symptomatic acute liver decompensation. She has been evaluated by the transplant team and recommended admission for possible transplant based on an elevated MELD score.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is believed to be due to redistribution of fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments. This can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and potentially result in organ failure.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has altered skin integrity, as evidenced by the presence of ascites and peripheral edema. This can increase the risk of skin infections and pressure ulcers.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to urinary fluid loss or infection. Given the plan for transplant, it is important to identify and treat any potential infectious source.
4. Nausea: The patient is experiencing nausea, which may be due to liver disease, pressor use, CVVH, medications, or a combination of these factors. Appropriate antiemetic medications are being administered to control nausea and vomiting.

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
   51 year old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated
   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg tid
   - Goal MAP >65; on norepinephrine [levo]. Wean today as tolerated
   (albeit given nausea/vomiting and CVVH difficult to wean).
   - f/u with hepatology and renal recs
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: MELD score based on [**11-7**] labs = 40.
   Patient currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically symptoms
   of acute liver decompensation. Patient has been evaluated by the
   transplant team as an outpatient who recommended admission for possible
   tranplant based on elevated MELD score. s/p EGD on [**11-7**]. s/p dobhoff
   placement on [**11-7**]. Listed for transplant for kidney/liver.
   - EGD and Dobhoff done on [**11-7**]; OK to feed through Dobhoff so long as
   flowing freely.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue rifaximin to 400mg tid
   - Continue ciprofloxacin for SBP pxs
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs
   - no need for transfusion today
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Could be due to UF, but given concern for infection in
   setting of plan for transplant, looking for infectious source too.
   - follow up sputum, blood and urine (if possible) cultures
   - C. diff negative
   .
   # Hepatorenal Syndrome: Creatinine on transfer to MICU 4.2. Requires
   dialysis three times a week. Patient is candidate for dual liver-renal
   transplant and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**].
   - Continue midodrine
   - Holding sevelamer given pt
s hypophosphatemia
   - continue nephrocaps
   - s/p albumin on [**11-7**], no albumin needed as pt w. chronic renal
   insufficiency
   - f/u renal and hepatology recs
   - Epo with HD for anemia of ESRD, MWF
   - Repleted phos this AM; pm lyte check and replete all lytes prn
   - continue CVVH; discuss with renal re: CVVH holiday and decreasing
   pressor requirement, given patient net >4L negative over ICU stay and
   also rather nauseous, a CVVH holiday might help her feel better
   .
   # Nausea: Perhaps due to liver disease, pressor, CVVH, medications.
   - Zofran 8mg q8h IV standing
   - Morphine 1-2mg IV q4h prn
   - Hold on ativan if possible, given ESLD
   - Restart TF
s slowly as tolerated, after nausea more controlled later
   today
   .
   # Alcohol abuse: Patient has not had a drink since [**Month (only) 93**], therefore no
   need for CIWA.
   - Continue Folic Acid, Thiamine, MVI
   .
   FEN: Renal diet. PO ok.
   - Tubefeeds per nutrition recs, slowly given nausea.
   .
   PPX:  DVT ppx with Pneumoboots; omeprazole 20mg daily; bowel regimen
   lactulose.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with ETOH cirrhosis, ESLD, worsening renal failure, and hepatorenal syndrome. She is currently on midodrine and levophed for hypotension. She is also on various medications including lactulose, rifaxamin, morphine, folate, nephrocaps, thiamine, cipro, EPO, zofran, neutraphos, and prevacid. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has edema in both lower extremities and is experiencing some abdominal pain. Laboratory results indicate liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state, she is at a higher risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
2. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PT/INR suggests a coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding. This could be exacerbated by the use of anticoagulant medications or procedures.
3. Hepatic encephal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis and acute renal failure. She is currently listed for a liver/kidney transplant. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and requires close monitoring. She is experiencing hypotension, nausea, and leukocytosis. The patient has multiple medical complications, including impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, hepatorenal syndrome, and possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, which is believed to be due to redistribution of fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments. This can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and may require pressor support.
2. Nausea and vomiting: The patient is experiencing ongoing nausea and vomiting, which could be related to liver disease, pressor use, continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH), or medications. Nausea can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to urinary floss (UF), infection, or a combination of both. Given the patient's plan for transplant, it is important to identify and treat any potential infectious source promptly.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She is being evaluated for possible liver transplant and has also been listed for kidney transplant due to acute renal failure. The patient has been admitted multiple times with various complications related to her liver disease and renal failure, including hypotension, infection, and hepato-renal syndrome. She is currently in the ICU where she is being closely monitored and receiving treatment for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, which can be attributed to fluid redistribution from the intravascular to extravascular compartments. This can lead to significant ascites and peripheral edema. Close blood pressure monitoring and the use of pressors are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure levels.

2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to urinary fluid (UF) or an infectious source. Given her planned transplant, it is crucial to identify and treat any potential infections promptly. The patient's C. difficile test was negative, but there is a concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) given her elevated white blood cell count and tender abdomen. Blood and para cultures are pending.

3. Hepato-renal syndrome (HRS): The patient has impaired liver function and renal failure. HRS is a complication of ESLD characterized by severe impairment of renal function. It requires immediate attention and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol use disorder (ETOH) and cirrhosis who is currently experiencing renal failure and being treated with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including blood cultures from the PICC line and Quinton catheter, ultrasound, paracentesis, and administration of various medications.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/56 mmHg to 104/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has decreased from 94.5 kg at admission to 99 kg currently.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.8-16.3 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 24.5-27.1%, increased platelet count (Plt) of 125-150 K/uL, and abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST: 26/101, Alk Phos/T Bili: 153/25.2). Other lab values such as blood glucose levels and electrolytes are also abnormal.

   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle. Pt completed EGD and dobhoff placement.  Now she is being
   weaned off pressors gradually, while undergoing CVVH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She has been admitted to the ICU for hypotension and is currently on dialysis. The patient is also a candidate for dual liver-renal transplant. She has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and nausea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to redistribution of fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as evidenced by significant ascites and peripheral edema. Close BP monitoring and pressors are being used to manage this condition.

2. Liver Disease: The patient has ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. This condition can lead to liver dysfunction and complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.

3. Renal Failure: The patient requires dialysis three times a week due to renal failure. This indicates compromised kidney function, which may be related to her underlying liver disease or other factors.

4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, a condition where renal failure occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease. It is characterized by poor perfusion to the kidneys.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can be a result of liver disease and its associated complications. This increases the risk of infections and skin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis, complicated by hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) requiring dialysis. She has been admitted with a high model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing due to hypotension. The patient is currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically evident acute liver decompensation. She has been evaluated by the transplant team as an outpatient who recommended admission for possible transplant based on elevated MELD score. She has been listed for transplant for kidney/liver. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is believed to be due to redistribution of fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as evidenced by significant ascites/peripheral edema. The patient is being closely monitored for blood pressure and is receiving pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. Close monitoring and gradual weaning of pressors will be continued.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, possibly due to ESLD. Regular assessment and management of any skin lesions or wounds are necessary to prevent infections.
3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient is not tolerating tube feeds, so enteral nutrition will be held temporarily. The patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored, and alternative methods of providing nutrition may need to be considered.
4. Renal Failure: The patient requires dialysis three times a week due to renal failure. Monitoring of renal function and ongoing communication with the renal team are essential for managing the patient's renal failure.
5. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has HRS, which is a complication of ESLD characterized by renal failure. Close monitoring of liver and renal function, along with ongoing management of fluid balance and electrolyte disturbances, is crucial.
6. Infection: The patient is at high risk for infections due to ESLD and immunosuppressive therapy. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and changes in mental status, is necessary.
7. Alcohol Abuse: Although the patient has not had a drink since [**Month (only) 93**], ongoing monitoring and support for alcohol abuse are important to prevent relapse.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional assessments and evaluations may be required to fully understand the patient's condition and potential medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis and acute renal failure. She has been on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and vasopressor support with levophed. The patient's stool culture showed Clostridium difficile (C. diff). She has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, pain management, and other supportive care. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she has edema in her lower extremities and jaundice. The patient's laboratory results indicate abnormalities in liver function, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and other metabolic imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome: This condition occurs when severe liver disease leads to kidney dysfunction. In this case, the patient's liver cirrhosis may worsen, leading to further renal impairment.
2. Infection: The presence of C. diff in the stool culture suggests an intestinal infection. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can lead to severe gastrointestinal symptoms and complications.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake-output discrepancy, indicating potential fluid overload. This can increase the risk of pulmonary edema and cardiovascular complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently low, indicating hypotension. If not managed properly, it can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and"

 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
   51 year old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated
   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle. Pt completed EGD and dobhoff placement.  Now she is being
   weaned off pressors gradually, while undergoing CVVH.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg tid
   - 1 unit PRBC per renal recs for volume and BP
   - 50g albumin today (day [**1-24**] on [**11-14**])
   - Goal MAP >60; on norepinephrine [levo]. Wean today as tolerated.

   - f/u renal recs re: HD vs CVVH
   - hold on CVVH for now
   - IVF as needed for BP; monitor PO2 and lung exam
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Could be due to UF, but given concern for infection in
   setting of plan for transplant, looking for infectious source too.  C.
   diff negative.  Possible SBP given leukocytosis and tender abdomen, but
   no fever or evidence of SBP.
   - follow up cultures (blood, paracentesis)
   - vanc, zosyn, (started [**11-11**], d/c [**11-18**]) per ID
 7 day course of
   broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - check vanco trough
   - Change from PO flagyl to po Vanc for empiric C. Diff coverage (day 1
   [**11-13**])
   - add Micafungin 100 mg IV Q24H  for empiric fungal coverage(day 1
   [**11-13**])
   - Send stool cytotoxin assay, serum cryptogen, urine histoplasma per ID
   recs; will send serum histo level given pt does not make urine
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: Patient currently stable and fully oriented
   with no clinically symptoms of acute liver decompensation. Patient has
   been evaluated by the transplant team as an outpatient who recommended
   admission for possible tranplant based on elevated MELD score. s/p EGD
   on [**11-7**]. s/p dobhoff placement on [**11-7**]. Listed for transplant for
   kidney/liver.  MELD [**11-7**] 40, [**11-11**] = 42.
   - EGD and Dobhoff done on [**11-7**].
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue rifaximin to 400mg tid
   - 50g albumin today (day [**1-24**] on [**11-14**])
   - Since patient on broad-spectrum antibiotics, d/c cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis and then after 7-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   ends, plan to restart cipro
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs, transplant recs
   .
   # Renal Failure: Creatinine on transfer to MICU 4.2. Requires dialysis
   three times a week. Patient is candidate for dual liver-renal
   transplant and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**].
   - Holding sevelamer given pt
s hypophosphatemia
   - continue nephrocaps
   - f/u renal recs
   - Epo with HD for anemia of ESRD, MWF
   - Hold on CVVH; concern for over-diuresis as etiology of nausea and
   continued hypotension
   .
   # Nausea: Perhaps due to liver disease, pressors, CVVH, medications.
   - Zofran 8mg q8h IV; change from standing to prn given improved nausea
   - Morphine 0.5-1mg IV q4h prn
   - Hold on ativan if possible, given ESLD
   - Not tolerating tubefeeds, hold them
   .
   # Alcohol abuse: Patient has not had a drink since [**Month (only) 93**], therefore no
   need for CIWA.
   - Continue Folic Acid, Thiamine, MVI
   .
   FEN: Dobhoff in place. PO ok as tolerated.  Speak to nutrition re: PPN
   and advancing tube feeds given improving nausea but concern for
   over-feeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She has been admitted for possible transplant evaluation but has not been able to undergo testing due to hypotension. The patient's MELD score is elevated, indicating a high urgency for transplantation.

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with acute renal failure. She requires dialysis three times a week and is a candidate for dual liver-renal transplant.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is believed to be due to redistribution of fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as evidenced by significant ascites and peripheral edema. Close blood pressure monitoring and the use of pressors are being utilized to manage this condition.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to ultrafiltration (UF) or an infectious source. Infection is a concern, especially in the context of planned transplantation. Cultures have been obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

3. End-stage liver disease (ESLD): The patient is currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically symptomatic acute liver decompensation. She has been evaluated by the transplant team as an outpatient and recommended admission for possible transplant based on her elevated MELD score.

   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle. Pt completed EGD and dobhoff placement.  Now she is being
   weaned off pressors gradually, while undergoing CVVH.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg tid
   - Goal MAP >60; on norepinephrine [levo]. Wean today as tolerated.
   - 50g albumin today (day [**1-24**] on [**11-14**])
   - f/u with hepatology and renal recs
   - hold on CVVH for now
   - IVF as needed for BP; monitor PO2 and lung exam
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: Patient currently stable and fully oriented
   with no clinically symptoms of acute liver decompensation. Patient has
   been evaluated by the transplant team as an outpatient who recommended
   admission for possible tranplant based on elevated MELD score. s/p EGD
   on [**11-7**]. s/p dobhoff placement on [**11-7**]. Listed for transplant for
   kidney/liver.  MELD [**11-7**] 40, [**11-11**] = 42.
   - EGD and Dobhoff done on [**11-7**].
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue rifaximin to 400mg tid
   - 50g albumin today (day [**1-24**] on [**11-14**])
   - Since patient on broad-spectrum antibiotics, d/c cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis and then after 7-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   ends, plan to restart cipro
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs, transplant recs
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Could be due to UF, but given concern for infection in
   setting of plan for transplant, looking for infectious source too.  C.
   diff negative.  Possible SBP given leukocytosis and tender abdomen, but
   no fever or evidence of SBP.
   - follow up cultures (blood, paracentesis)
   - vanc, zosyn, (started [**11-11**]) per ID
 7 day course of broad-spectrum
   antibiotics
   - check vanco trough
   - repeat C. diff today
   - add PO flagyl for empiric C. Diff (day 1 [**11-13**])
   - add Micafungin 100 mg IV Q24H  for empiric fungal coverage(day 1
   [**11-13**])
   .
   # Renal Failure: Creatinine on transfer to MICU 4.2. Requires dialysis
   three times a week. Patient is candidate for dual liver-renal
   transplant and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**].
   - Holding sevelamer given pt
s hypophosphatemia
   - continue nephrocaps
   - f/u renal recs
   - Epo with HD for anemia of ESRD, MWF
   - Hold on CVVH; concern for over-diuresis as etiology of nausea and
   continued hypotension
   .
   # Nausea: Perhaps due to liver disease, pressors, CVVH, medications.
   - Zofran 8mg q8h IV standing
   - Morphine 0.5-1mg IV q4h prn
   - Hold on ativan if possible, given ESLD
   - Not tolerating tubefeeds, hold them

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She has been admitted to the ICU for possible liver transplant evaluation due to a high MELD score. The patient has developed acute renal failure requiring dialysis, hypotension, altered nutrition, and hepato-renal syndrome. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off pressors. The patient's medical history includes alcohol abuse, and she is listed for liver/kidney transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is believed to be due to fluid redistribution from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as evidenced by significant ascites and peripheral edema. Close blood pressure monitoring and the use of vasopressors are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an obstacle.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level on transfer to the MICU was 4.2, indicating renal dysfunction. She requires dialysis three times a week. Given her candidacy for a dual liver-renal transplant, it is important to follow up with renal recommendations and hold on CVVH due to concerns about over-diuresis causing nausea and continued hypotension.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count could be due to ultrafiltration (UF), but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She is in the ICU due to acute renal failure and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient has been listed for possible liver and kidney transplant but has not been able to undergo testing due to hypotension. She has been receiving dialysis three times a week and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infection. Her current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, micafungin, midodrine, and albumin. She also has leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, and end-stage liver disease. The patient's nausea is being managed with Zofran and morphine. She has a power PICC line, R IJ HD catheter, and PIV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and cultures are pending.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and she requires dialysis. There is a concern for over-diuresis causing hypotension and nausea.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure associated with liver disease. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.
4. Liver Transplant: The patient is listed for liver transplant, but complications can arise during the evaluation and transplantation process.
5. Acute on Chronic Liver Failure: The patient's liver disease may decompensate further, leading to increased symptoms and complications.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has abnormal coagulation parameters, which can increase the risk of bleeding or clotting.
7. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which can be related to her liver disease, fluid shifts, or medications. Close monitoring and adjustment of pressors are needed.
8. C. difficile infection: The patient has been treated for C. difficile infection, but there is a possibility of recurrence.
9. Fungal infection: The patient is receiving empiric fungal coverage due to concern for an invasive fungal infection.
10. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate levels are decreasing, indicating metabolic acidosis. This requires further evaluation and management.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided medical progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She has been admitted for possible transplant due to a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, leukocytosis, renal failure, and nausea. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for an infectious source, as well as medications to manage her ESLD and potential transplant. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is fully oriented with no symptoms of acute liver decompensation. However, there are concerns about her nutrition, overfeeding, and the need for dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): Given the patient's ESLD and renal failure, she is at risk for developing HRS. This condition can lead to worsening renal function and potentially require dialysis.
2. Infection: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics due to the suspicion of an infectious source. It is important to monitor for any signs of infection or sepsis, as these can rapidly deteriorate the patient's condition.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has been treated for C. difficile infection in the past, so it is important to monitor for any recurrence or complications related to this infection.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema indicate a fluid imbalance. Close monitoring"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of alcohol-induced cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), awaiting a transplant. She was recently weaned off vasopressors and is scheduled for hemodialysis (HD) today. The patient has several medical allergies, including sulfonamide antibiotics, and wheezing with phenylephrine. Her last doses of antibiotics were Micafungin on 11/14/2169 at 07:57 PM and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 11/15/2169 at 07:45 AM. The patient is receiving multiple medications in the ICU, including morphine sulfate, folate, thiamine, prevacid, insulin SS, vitamin D, midodrine, epo, lactulose, reglan, zosyn, and micafungin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has impaired liver function, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's jaundiced skin indicates impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of infections and pressure ulcers.
3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient is receiving peripheral parenteral nutrition and has an altered nutritional status due to her critical illness and impaired gastrointestinal function.
4. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Renal Failure, ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, which can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for dialysis.
5. Hepatorenal Syndrome: Given the patient's history of liver cirrhosis and acute renal failure, there is a possibility of developing hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure seen in advanced liver disease.
6. Hospital-Acquired Infections: The prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines and catheters increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple complex medical conditions that require close monitoring and management in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a history of ETOH cirrhosis and ESRD on HD. She tolerated her HD well yesterday and has been off pressors. She has allergies to sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics) and wheezing with phenylephrine. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole at 04:00 PM on 11/15/2169, vancomycin at 06:15 PM on 11/15/2169, micafungin at 06:23 PM on 11/15/2169, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 07:47 PM on 11/15/2169. She is currently receiving several ICU medications, including morphine sulfate, folate, midodrine, epo, lactulose, reglan, vanco PO, and granulex. There are no changes to her medical and family history, review of systems, or physical examination compared to admission except for noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has liver cirrhosis and there are elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 27/79) indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. This could lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has jaundice, which suggests impaired skin"

 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
   51 year old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated
   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle. Pt completed EGD and dobhoff placement.  Now she is being
   weaned off pressors gradually, while undergoing CVVH. Off of pressors
   since [**11-14**] in the evening. s/p 4 days of albumin [**Date range (1) 10024**].
   - Continue midodrine 15mg tid
   - Goal MAP >65; restart levo if needed
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - f/u renal recs
   - IVF as alternative/additional treatment for hypotension if needed
   - no more albumin for now
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Could be due to UF, but given concern for infection in
   setting of plan for transplant, looking for infectious source too.  C.
   diff negative.  Possible SBP given leukocytosis and tender abdomen, but
   no fever or evidence of SBP.
   - will recheck c. diff
   - will discuss necessity of repeat paracentesis with transplant surgery
   (is it necessary for pt is to get transplant?)/
   - follow up cultures (blood, paracentesis)
   - vanc, zosyn, (started [**11-11**], d/c [**11-18**]) per ID
 need to follow up
   with ID total course of abxs
   - follow up this morning
s vanco trough and order one for tomorrow;
   hold on giving more vanco doses for now, pending result
   - continue po vancomycin for empiric C. Diff coverage (day 1=[**11-13**])
   - continue Micafungin 100 mg IV Q24h  for empiric fungal coverage(day
   1=[**11-13**])
   - f/u stool cytotoxin assay, serum histoplasma
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: Patient currently stable and fully oriented
   with no clinically symptoms of acute liver decompensation. Patient has
   been evaluated by the transplant team as an outpatient who recommended
   admission for possible tranplant based on elevated MELD score. s/p EGD
   on [**11-7**]. s/p dobhoff placement on [**11-7**]. Listed for transplant for
   kidney/liver.  MELD [**11-7**] 40, [**11-11**] = 42.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue rifaximin
   - Since patient on broad-spectrum antibiotics, d/c
d cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis and then after 7-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   ends (on [**11-18**]), plan to restart cipro for SBP prophylaxis
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs, transplant recs
   .
   # Renal Failure: Creatinine on transfer to MICU 4.2. Requires dialysis
   three times a week. Patient is candidate for dual liver-renal
   transplant and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**].  Hepato-renal syndrome.
   - continue nephrocaps
   - f/u renal recs, in particular re: dialysis type and timing
   - Epo with HD for anemia of ESRD, M-W-F
   .
   # Nausea: Perhaps due to liver disease, pressors, CVVH, medications.
   Tolerating tubefeeds slowly.
   - Ok to take PO as tolerated/desired by patient
   - Tubefeeds running at 10 continuously (ie: do not escalate rate/dose)
   as tolerated
   - Zofran 8mg q8h IV prn
 aggressive giving of this medication as
   needed
   - Morphine 0.5-1mg IV q4h prn
   - Hold on ativan if possible, given ESLD
   - PPN so that volume of tubefeeds can be lower (ie: 10) [not doing TPN
   due to limited IV access, and coagulopathic so want to avoid extra
   invasive procedures in her]
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: bicarb improved s/p HD on [**11-15**].
   - Hold on suctioning out bile
   - Monitor daily
   .
   # Alcohol abuse: Patient has not had a drink since [**Month (only) 93**], therefore no
   need for CIWA.
   - Discontinue folic acid, thiamine, MVI
 feel that she is now repleted

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated by HRS. The patient is in the ICU due to high MELD score for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is believed to be due to redistribution of fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments. The patient has been on pressors and is being weaned off gradually. The goal MAP is >65, and midodrine is being continued at 15 mg tid. Levo may be restarted if needed.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to ultrafiltration (UF) or an infectious source. C. diff negative, and possible SBP is suspected given the leukocytosis and tender abdomen. However, no fever or evidence of SBP has been found. Follow-up cultures (blood, paracentesis) and ID consultation are recommended.

3. End-stage liver disease (ESLD): The patient is listed for transplant due to an elevated MELD score. She is currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically evident acute liver decompensation. Lactulose and rifaximin are being continued for hepatic encephalopathy prophylaxis.

4. Renal failure: The patient requires dial"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She has been admitted for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing due to hypotension. The patient also has hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and requires dialysis.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is believed to be due to redistribution of fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments. Close blood pressure monitoring and use of pressors are being used to manage this condition.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to ultrafiltration (UF) or an underlying infection. Further evaluation is needed to identify the cause.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has improved bicarbonate levels after hemodialysis (HD) on [**11-15**]. Daily monitoring is recommended.

4. End-stage liver disease: The patient is currently stable and fully oriented with no symptoms of acute liver decompensation. She has been evaluated by the transplant team and listed for kidney/liver transplant. MELD scores have been recorded on [**11-7**] and [**11-11**].

- The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to ultrafiltration (UF), but there is also concern for infection in the setting of planned transplant. C. diff negative, possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) given leukocytosis and tender abdomen, but no fever or evidence of SBP.
- She has liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and nausea.
- The patient requires close blood pressure monitoring and may need pressors. She is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
- The patient's renal function is impaired with a creatinine level of 4.2 on transfer to the MICU. She requires dialysis three times a week and is a candidate for dual liver-renal transplant.
- She is tolerating tube feeds"

   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle. Pt completed EGD and dobhoff placement.  Now she is being

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She is listed for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing due to hypotension. The patient requires dialysis three times a week and is a candidate for dual liver-renal transplant. She is currently in the ICU for close blood pressure monitoring and is awaiting liver/kidney transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is being closely monitored in the ICU. Pressors may be used to maintain adequate blood pressure, and midodrine is being given to increase mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. If needed, levo is restarted to achieve the target MAP.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to ultrafiltration (UF) or an infectious source. Infection is a concern, especially in the setting of planned transplant. Cultures have been obtained, and ceftriaxone and vancomycin are being administered. The patient's Clostridium difficile (C. diff) status is negative.

3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, including elevated bilirubin levels. Lactulose is being continued to manage hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a heel ulcer that requires wound"

   51 year old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated
   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle. Pt completed EGD and dobhoff placement.  Now she is being
   weaned off pressors gradually, while undergoing CVVH. Off of pressors
   since [**11-14**] in the evening. s/p 4 days of albumin [**Date range (1) 10024**], and on
   [**11-18**] pre-HD too.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg tid
   - Goal MAP >65; restart levo if needed
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - f/u renal recs
   - IVF as alternative/additional treatment for hypotension if needed
   - antibiotics as below
   - consider giving albumin prior to today
s therapeutic paracentesis
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Could be due to UF, but given concern for infection in
   setting of plan for transplant, looking for infectious source too.  C.
   diff negative x3.  Possible SBP given leukocytosis and tender abdomen,
   but no fever or evidence of SBP. s/p 7 day course of empiric vanc and
   zosyn that ran from [**11-11**] to [**11-18**].
   - confirm with ID that vanc/zosyn empiric course should end after 7
   days, versus continuing for a longer period of time
   - diagnostic paracentesis today (radiology u/s marked spot on [**11-18**]);
   plus therapeutic approx 5L planned too
   - follow up cultures (blood, paracentesis)
   - continue po vancomycin for empiric C. Diff coverage (day 1=[**11-13**])
   - continue Micafungin 100 mg IV Q24h  for empiric fungal coverage(day
   1=[**11-13**])
   - f/u stool cytotoxin assay, serum histoplasma
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: Patient currently stable and fully oriented
   with no clinically symptoms of acute liver decompensation. Patient has
   been evaluated by the transplant team as an outpatient who recommended
   admission for possible tranplant based on elevated MELD score. s/p EGD
   on [**11-7**]. s/p dobhoff placement on [**11-7**]. Listed for transplant for
   kidney/liver.  MELD [**11-7**] 40, [**11-11**] = 42.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue rifaximin
   - Since patient on broad-spectrum antibiotics, d/c
d cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis and then after 7-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   ends (on [**11-18**]), plan to restart cipro for SBP prophylaxis = today;
   confirm vanc/zosyn treatment course length first with ID then add back
   or not the cipro
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs, transplant recs
   - diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis today

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis. She has been admitted for possible liver transplant but has not been able to undergo testing due to hypotension. The patient has a history of multiple complications including hypotension, leukocytosis, impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, and alcohol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to fluid redistribution from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as evidenced by significant ascites and peripheral edema. Close blood pressure monitoring and the use of vasopressors are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure levels.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count could be a result of hemodialysis (UF) or an infectious source. In the setting of a planned transplant, there is a concern for infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of leukocytosis.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has significant jaundice, which indicates impaired liver function affecting skin integrity. Monitoring for any skin breakdown or ulceration is essential.
4. Altered Nutrition: The patient's impaired liver function can lead to malabsorption and altered nutrition. Nutritional support should be provided through enteral or parenteral routes.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal failure. Dialysis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis, complicated by hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She has been admitted for possible liver transplant evaluation and is currently in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes alcohol abuse and she is listed for kidney/liver transplant. She has multiple comorbidities including hypotension, liver function abnormalities, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, acute renal failure, and hepatorenal syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension, which could be due to fluid redistribution from the intravascular to extravascular compartments as evidenced by significant ascites and peripheral edema. Close blood pressure monitoring and use of pressors are ongoing to manage this condition.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count could be due to ultrafiltration (UF) or an infectious source. Given her planned transplant, there is concern for infection, so further investigation for an infectious source is needed. C. difficile is negative, but possible spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) should be considered given the leukocytosis and tender abdomen. Cultures (blood, paracentesis) and follow-up cultures are planned.

3. End-stage liver disease: The patient's ESLD is causing complications such as impaired liver function and portal hypertension. She is currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to ETOH (alcohol) cirrhosis complicated by HRS (hepatorenal syndrome). He is admitted for possible liver transplant but unable to tolerate testing. The patient has been evaluated by the transplant team and recommended admission for possible transplant based on an elevated MELD score. He has been listed for a kidney/liver transplant. The patient's current condition is stable and fully oriented with no clinically symptomatic acute liver decompensation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is thought to be fluid redistribution into extravascular compartments. Pressors have been used but are now stopped for the past several days. The patient recently underwent a significant therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis. 
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is trending down from 20 now stable in the teens. He received a 7-day course of vancomycin and zosyn for hypotension. No infectious source has been identified to date with negative C. Diff and recent paracentesis not demonstrating SBP.
3. End-stage liver disease: The patient has ESLD and is listed for a kidney/liver transplant. He requires ongoing management of his liver disease with lactulose and rifaximin. 
4. Renal failure: The patient requires dialysis three times"

   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle. Pt completed EGD and dobhoff placement.  Now she is being
   weaned off pressors gradually, while undergoing CVVH. Off of pressors

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of ESLD due to ETOH cirrhosis complicated by HRS. He is currently in the ICU awaiting a possible liver-kidney transplant. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is believed to be due to fluid redistribution from the intravascular to extravascular compartments. He has also had episodes of leukocytosis, nausea, and renal failure requiring dialysis. The patient's MELD score is elevated, indicating a high level of liver disease severity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ failure.
2. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and leukocytosis, there is a risk of infection, including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or sepsis.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, requiring ongoing dialysis support.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's advanced liver disease increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be exacerbated by the use of anticoagulant therapies.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient may develop hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and neuropsychiatric symptoms.
6. Transplant rejection: After the liver-kidney transplant, the patient may face the risk of organ"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease) due to ETOH (Alcohol) cirrhosis complicated by HRS (Hepatic Respiratory Syndrome). The patient was admitted for possible L-K (liver-kidney) transplant but was unable to tolerate testing due to hypotension. The patient has been evaluated by the transplant team and listed for transplant based on an elevated MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score.

The patient is currently stable and fully oriented with no clinically significant symptoms of acute liver decompensation. However, the patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is thought to be caused by fluid redistribution into extravascular compartments. The patient is currently off pressors and has undergone a significant therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis. The plan is to continue midodrine 15 mg TID, restart levo if needed, and use IV fluids as needed.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a high white blood cell count, which is trending down from 20 now stable in the teens. The patient has received a 7-day course of vancomycin and zosyn for hypotension. No infectious source has been identified to date with negative C. Diff and recent paracentesis not demonstrating SBP. The plan is to follow up with ID ("

 HEPATORENAL SYNDROME
   51 year old female with ESLD secondary to alcohol cirrhosis complicated
   by HRS requiring dialysis. Patient has been admitted in context of high
   MELD for possible transplant but has not been able to undergo testing
   [**12-26**] hypotension.
   .
   #. Hypotension: With CVP of 20, believed to be due to redistribution of
   fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments, as
   evidenced by hypotension and significant ascites/peripheral edema. In
   the ICU, through close BP monitoring plus pressors, hopefully can
   continue ESLD work-up without hypotension/lightheadedness being an
   obstacle. Pt completed EGD and dobhoff placement.  Now she is being
   weaned off pressors gradually, while undergoing CVVH. Off of pressors
   since [**11-14**] in the evening. s/p 4 days of albumin [**Date range (1) 10024**], and on
   [**11-18**] pre-HD too.
   - Continue midodrine 15mg tid
   - Goal MAP >65; restart levo if needed
   - f/u hepatology recs
   - f/u renal recs
   - IVF as alternative/additional treatment for hypotension if needed
   - antibiotics as below
   - consider giving albumin prior to today
s therapeutic paracentesis
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Could be due to UF, but given concern for infection in
   setting of plan for transplant, looking for infectious source too.  C.
   diff negative x3.  Possible SBP given leukocytosis and tender abdomen,
   but no fever or evidence of SBP. s/p 7 day course of empiric vanc and
   zosyn that ran from [**11-11**] to [**11-18**].
   - confirm with ID that vanc/zosyn empiric course should end after 7
   days, versus continuing for a longer period of time
   - diagnostic paracentesis today (radiology u/s marked spot on [**11-18**]);
   plus therapeutic approx 5L planned too
   - follow up cultures (blood, paracentesis)
   - continue po vancomycin for empiric C. Diff coverage (day 1=[**11-13**])
   - continue Micafungin 100 mg IV Q24h  for empiric fungal coverage(day
   1=[**11-13**])
   - f/u stool cytotoxin assay, serum histoplasma
   .
   #. End-stage liver disease: Patient currently stable and fully oriented
   with no clinically symptoms of acute liver decompensation. Patient has
   been evaluated by the transplant team as an outpatient who recommended
   admission for possible tranplant based on elevated MELD score. s/p EGD
   on [**11-7**]. s/p dobhoff placement on [**11-7**]. Listed for transplant for
   kidney/liver.  MELD [**11-7**] 40, [**11-11**] = 42.
   - Continue lactulose
   - Continue rifaximin
   - Since patient on broad-spectrum antibiotics, d/c
d cipro for SBP
   prophylaxis and then after 7-day course of broad-spectrum antibiotics
   ends (on [**11-18**]), plan to restart cipro for SBP prophylaxis = today;
   confirm vanc/zosyn treatment course length first with ID then add back
   or not the cipro
   - Active T & S
   - F/u hepatology recs, transplant recs
   - diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis today
   .
   # Renal Failure: Creatinine on transfer to MICU 4.2. Requires dialysis
   three times a week. Patient is candidate for dual liver-renal
   transplant and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9881**].  Hepato-renal syndrome. s/p HD
   on [**11-18**]
   - continue nephrocaps
   - f/u renal recs
   - per renal, no more epo
   .
   # Nausea: Perhaps due to liver disease, pressors, CVVH, medications.
   New Dobhoff placed by IR (d/t clog) on [**11-18**].
   - try to unclog Dobhoff; if not, call IR for help
   - Ok to take PO as tolerated/desired by patient, encourage

   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: bicarb improved s/p HD. Resolved.
   - Hold on suctioning out bile
   - Monitor daily
   .
   # Alcohol abuse: Patient has not had a drink since [**Month (only) 93**], therefore no
   need for CIWA.
   - Discontinued folic acid, thiamine, MVI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to alcohol cirrhosis, complicated by hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She requires dialysis and is awaiting a liver transplant. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, which is believed to be caused by redistribution of fluids from the intravascular to extravascular compartments. The patient has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and a dobbhoff placement.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 95/42 mmHg (58/40-125/65 mmHg), respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's general appearance is described as alert and oriented, with profound jaundice. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally. There is no murmur heard on heart examination. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness with bowel sounds present. Extremities show no clubbing or cyanosis.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.1 K/uL. Other notable lab values include hemoglobin (Hct) of 24.4%, platelet count of 175 K/uL, creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL, blood glucose of 170 mg/dL, and INR of 2.1. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) for suspected infection. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. The first is hypotension, which is being managed with midodrine and close blood pressure monitoring. Pressors may be restarted if needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The second complication is leukocytosis, which could be due to uric acid filtration or an infectious source. The patient has completed a 7-day course of empiric antibiotics and is awaiting further infectious workup. A diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis will be performed today due to abdominal tenderness and significant ascites. The third complication is renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL. The patient requires dialysis three times a week. Finally, the patient has nausea, which could be attributed to liver disease, medications, or CVVH. Nausea management will involve the use of Zofran and morphine as needed.

The patient's disposition includes close BP monitoring in the ICU, continued treatment for hypotension, and ongoing evaluation for liver/kidney transplant."
