   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o woman with metastatic melanoma who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from
   the OMED biologics service due to respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient currently satting well on
   non-rebreather but has a high A-a gradient.  Differential includes
   pulmonary edema, systolic heart failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary
   embolism, but most likely etiology is pulmonary edema from vasogenic
   leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy.  Initially was diuresed
   aggressively but now with metabolic contraction alkolosis on [**2110-1-21**].
   - continue to follow ABGs
   - consider chest CTA if hypoxia does not resolve but no empiric
   anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   - consider lasix bolus if CVP increases
   # Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] represent chemo affect but also concerning for
   infection.
   - pan cx (blood, urine)
   - send c diff
   - continue vanc and zosyn until blood cx negative x 72 hours
   - will d/c cephalexin (given by Heme/onc service as CVL infection ppx)
   but restart when vanc stopped
   # Elevated LFTs:  Likely secondary to IL-2 as this is a known adverse
   effect.  Trending down after peaking on [**2110-1-18**].  Other possibilities
   include viral hepatitis and cholecystitis.
   - check RUQ U/S
   - continue to trend and consider further ID evaluation if indicated
   # RLE edema: Has been persistent since [**2109-11-11**] and was actually
   patient's presenting symptom at the time of work-up for recurrent
   melanoma.  Likely secondary to pelvic compression of iliac vein from
   pelvic metastatic masses but should r/o DVT.
   - LENIs
   # Melanoma:  Initially had melanoma on left thigh in [**2105**] and again in
   [**2106**]; excised both times.  Received IFN-alpha after first melanoma but
   d/c'd because of peripheral neuropathy.  S/p IL-2 with last dose on

   # Depression/Anxiety:  continue home meds
   # Pain control:  continue oxycodone
   # Smoking history:  continue buproprion, nicotine patch

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. She is currently on non-rebreather oxygen and receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she has persistent hypercapnia and tachypnea. She has a history of intermittent tiring and recovering while on NIV. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and other abnormalities consistent with her condition. She has a history of melanoma and has undergone various treatments including IL-2 therapy. She also has right lower extremity edema, likely due to pelvic metastatic masses causing iliac vein compression. The patient's current assessment includes hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and right lower extremity edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory distress and high A-a gradient suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. This could be due to vasogenic leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy.
2. Infection: Leukocytosis indicates an increased white blood cell count, which can be a sign of infection. The patient is at risk for developing infections due to her immunosuppressed state from cancer and treatment.
3. Hepatic Dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes suggest possible hepatic dysfunction, which may be secondary to IL-2 therapy, viral hepatitis, or cholecystitis.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o woman with metastatic melanoma who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from
   the OMED biologics service due to respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient currently satting well on
   non-rebreather but has a high A-a gradient secondary to pulmonary edema
   from vasogenic leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy.  Other less
   likely possiblities include pna and PE.  Initially was diuresed
   aggressively but now with metabolic contraction alkolosis on [**2110-1-21**].
   - continue to follow ABGs
   - continue non-rebreather
   - consider lasix bolus if CVP increases
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - anticipate that respiratory status will gradually improve with time
   # Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] represent chemo affect but also concerning for
   infection.
   - pan cx (blood, urine)
   - send c diff
   - continue vanc and zosyn until blood cx negative x 72 hours
   - will d/c cephalexin (given by Heme/onc service as CVL infection ppx)
   but restart when vanc stopped
   # Elevated LFTs:  Likely secondary to IL-2 as this is a known adverse
   effect.  Trending down after peaking on [**2110-1-18**].  Negative RUQ U/S on
   [**2110-1-20**].
   - continue to trend and consider further ID evaluation if indicated
   # RLE edema: Has been persistent since [**2109-11-11**] and was actually
   patient's presenting symptom at the time of work-up for recurrent
   melanoma.  Secondary to pelvic compression of iliac vein from pelvic
   metastatic masses.  No DVT on LENIs.
   - continue to follow
   # Melanoma:  Initially had melanoma on left thigh in [**2105**] and again in
   [**2106**]; excised both times.  Received IFN-alpha after first melanoma but
   d/c'd because of peripheral neuropathy.  S/p IL-2 with last dose on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. She has been on non-rebreather and intermittent CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 100%. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.1°C, heart rate 95 bpm, blood pressure 119/57 mmHg, respiratory rate 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and cachectic appearance. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver function tests, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has a history of melanoma, depression/anxiety, smoking, and pain control. She is currently receiving multiple medications including furosemide, lorazepam, piperacillin, vancomycin, and lasix. The patient's condition is being monitored closely, and further management will be determined based on her response to treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has a high A-a gradient despite being on non-rebreather. This could be due to various causes such as pulmonary edema, systolic heart failure, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism. Immediate assessment and treatment are necessary to improve"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o woman with metastatic melanoma who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from
   the OMED biologics service due to respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient currently satting well on
   non-rebreather but has a high A-a gradient secondary to pulmonary edema
   from vasogenic leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy.  Other less
   likely possiblities include pna and PE.  Initially was diuresed
   aggressively but now with metabolic contraction alkolosis on [**2110-1-21**].
   - continue to follow ABGs
   - continue non-rebreather
   - consider lasix bolus if CVP increases
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - anticipate that respiratory status will gradually improve with time
   # Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] represent chemo affect but also concerning for
   infection.
   - pan cx (blood, urine)
   - send c diff
   - continue vanc and zosyn until blood cx negative x 72 hours
   - will d/c cephalexin (given by Heme/onc service as CVL infection ppx)
   but restart when vanc stopped
   # Elevated LFTs:  Likely secondary to IL-2 as this is a known adverse
   effect.  Trending down after peaking on [**2110-1-18**].  Negative RUQ U/S on
   [**2110-1-20**].
   - continue to trend and consider further ID evaluation if indicated
   # RLE edema: Has been persistent since [**2109-11-11**] and was actually
   patient's presenting symptom at the time of work-up for recurrent
   melanoma.  Secondary to pelvic compression of iliac vein from pelvic
   metastatic masses.  No DVT on LENIs.
   - continue to follow
   # Melanoma:  Initially had melanoma on left thigh in [**2105**] and again in
   [**2106**]; excised both times.  Received IFN-alpha after first melanoma but
   d/c'd because of peripheral neuropathy.  S/p IL-2 with last dose on
   [**2110-1-17**].  Will defer further mgmnt to heme onc.
   - f/u heme onc reccs
   # Depression/Anxiety:  continue home meds
   # Pain control:  continue oxycodone
   # Smoking history:  continue buproprion, nicotine patch
   # FEN: regular diet
   # CODE: FULL, discussed with patient
   # DiSPO: to OMED if Hct stable in AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. She has a history of melanoma on her left thigh, which was excised twice. She received IFN-alpha after the first melanoma but discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy. She underwent IL-2 therapy, with her last dose on [**2110-1-17**]. The patient is currently on non-rebreather oxygen and has a high A-a gradient secondary to pulmonary edema from vasogenic leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy. Other less likely possibilities include pneumonia and pulmonary embolism. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 137/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema from vasogenic leak secondary to IL-2 therapy. This complication needs to be closely monitored and managed with continued use of non-rebreather oxygen and consideration of a lasix bolus if CVP increases.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 30.7. This may be due to chemotherapy effect but also raises concern for infection. Further"
